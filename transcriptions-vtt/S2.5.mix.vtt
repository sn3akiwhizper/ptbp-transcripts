00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
Hello, my little listeners.

00:02.160 --> 00:05.160
It's your big beefy brisket wolf, the dog.

00:05.160 --> 00:08.280
And I'm here to sizzle myself up and feed myself

00:08.280 --> 00:11.120
to all of my hungry little babies.

00:11.120 --> 00:13.640
Make sure and take a Pepto, baby,

00:13.640 --> 00:16.240
because I don't go down smooth.

00:16.240 --> 00:21.800
I am digesting it, y'all, live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:21.800 --> 00:24.920
the best radio show that also operates

00:24.920 --> 00:27.640
as a pop-up barbecue restaurant.

00:27.680 --> 00:30.680
While we digest and digress,

00:30.680 --> 00:33.120
why not see what the adoring public

00:33.120 --> 00:35.400
is saying about us, shall we?

00:35.400 --> 00:37.360
I hope I impress.

00:37.360 --> 00:41.320
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from KDB in West Virginia,

00:41.320 --> 00:44.680
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Park.

00:44.680 --> 00:48.800
A quick and easy way to make wolf feel loved and supported.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.960
KDB writes, hello, coming at you from the land

00:52.960 --> 00:56.760
of the cryptids, almost heaven, West Virginia.

00:56.840 --> 01:00.160
I've been listening since early season one,

01:00.160 --> 01:02.480
and I'm loving all the eldritch horror

01:02.480 --> 01:04.240
y'all bring into my day.

01:04.240 --> 01:07.440
Thanks for your absolutely inspired characters,

01:07.440 --> 01:11.760
stories, editing, and for spicing up my music taste.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.880
Shout out to my friend, Sid,

01:13.880 --> 01:16.360
who I will eventually convince to listen

01:16.360 --> 01:18.840
to this podcast alongside me.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.880
And stay safe out there, wolf.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.680
We can't have the horrors that be stopping you

01:23.680 --> 01:26.040
from your wonderful hosting.

01:26.120 --> 01:30.240
Horrors that be stopping me?

01:30.240 --> 01:33.680
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.960
If there's one thing you should know, KDB in West Virginia,

01:37.960 --> 01:42.400
it's that the horrors that be should be terrified of me.

01:42.400 --> 01:46.520
There is no horror that I cannot simply consume.

01:46.520 --> 01:50.880
Any deranged beings out there that don't fear respect me

01:50.880 --> 01:55.520
simply haven't witnessed my capacity.

01:55.520 --> 01:56.760
If you want to write up something

01:56.760 --> 01:59.160
for your big beefy wolf to how,

01:59.160 --> 02:03.760
make a notification pop up on one of my many devices.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.320
How, you may ask?

02:05.320 --> 02:08.440
Just play some golf inside the libretto.

02:08.440 --> 02:12.600
That's right, the links are in the show notes.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.680
Oh, and I'm getting word here that my producer wants to add

02:15.680 --> 02:19.560
that also in those sweet delicious network revisions

02:19.560 --> 02:24.560
wrapped sausages are portals to our Patreon and merch shop.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.200
Let's make a deal.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.080
You slip me some greasy dollars

02:29.080 --> 02:31.600
and I'll keep reading the news.

02:31.600 --> 02:35.320
Last time, Julius blacked out at the foundry

02:35.320 --> 02:37.440
after his liquid inauguration

02:37.440 --> 02:40.680
into the 24 hour city news family.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.160
But Beck and Cal actually remembered

02:43.160 --> 02:46.000
the evening's post printing press.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.480
Beck was heckled by his disappointed mother Kim

02:49.480 --> 02:51.920
and Cal had an endearing heart to heart

02:51.960 --> 02:54.760
with his daughter Carol, which is great.

02:54.760 --> 02:59.000
I'll bet his story continues to be wholesome and delightful

02:59.000 --> 03:03.480
and definitely will not devolve into unadulterated madness.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.440
Probably, but keep your chin up.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.440
I've got a fresh little ditty here

03:08.440 --> 03:11.120
for our fifth episode of season two.

03:11.120 --> 03:15.520
Prepare yourself for a brand new theme song.

03:15.520 --> 03:20.520
It's altar girl with my life is great and it's all my fault.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
And it's all my fault

03:26.200 --> 03:28.200
Cause my life is great

03:31.160 --> 03:33.160
And it's all mine

03:40.640 --> 03:42.640
Cause my life is great

03:45.480 --> 03:47.480
And it's all my fault

03:51.920 --> 03:56.920
Dude, I just remember this, but last night

04:03.360 --> 04:04.960
I woke up in the middle of the night

04:04.960 --> 04:08.960
cause I like thought I was choking.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.760
Well, it was like, I was having a dream

04:10.760 --> 04:12.360
where I thought I was choking.

04:12.360 --> 04:15.080
Then I woke up, do what?

04:16.320 --> 04:17.240
On D's nest.

04:17.240 --> 04:21.440
No, I woke up and both sides of my nose were bleeding

04:21.960 --> 04:24.200
and I was just like breathing it in.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.720
And then this morning when I took a shower,

04:26.720 --> 04:29.000
I was like, Oh, I got to blow my nose.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.840
And I blew out a chunk of like dried blood

04:31.840 --> 04:33.640
that was like this fucking long.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.360
It was rad and disgusting.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.200
My dad gets them all the time from doing cocaine

04:42.200 --> 04:43.680
and I get them all the time

04:43.680 --> 04:46.680
cause my dad made me do cocaine when I was a little kid.

04:46.680 --> 04:47.800
It's cool. Your dad sounds cool.

04:47.800 --> 04:48.920
Well, it is cool.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.200
Cause you're like, yeah, I know somebody

04:50.200 --> 04:51.680
can get you cocaine.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.960
My dad, my cool dad.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.400
This is my mom and my plug.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.120
In that order, I love my mom.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.840
Fade up on Tuesday, July 5th.

05:04.840 --> 05:08.080
It's the Tuesday morning meeting here at Cannes.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.320
And as you're looking around the room,

05:09.320 --> 05:12.800
you notice that the producer of city action news,

05:12.800 --> 05:15.360
Ty for Rayland is nowhere to be found.

05:15.360 --> 05:18.120
He's normally at the big chair

05:18.120 --> 05:21.400
at the head of the table here at this long table

05:21.400 --> 05:23.520
in this beautiful conference room.

05:24.840 --> 05:29.600
Isabella Kaya, the head anchor city action news,

05:29.600 --> 05:32.760
who was once co-anchor with Cal Colorado,

05:32.760 --> 05:37.400
but now is the sole lead of city action news.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.400
She walks forward to the front of the room

05:40.400 --> 05:43.840
and stands at the head of the table.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.240
Hello everyone.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.760
Thank you all so much for being here today.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.680
As you may have heard, Ty for Rayland,

05:50.680 --> 05:54.880
our beautiful boss is out having a meeting

05:54.880 --> 05:58.360
at the city tower with the who's who and whatnot.

05:58.360 --> 06:01.760
So I'll be handing out assignments today.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.640
Quick question, just as a newsman.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.120
Cal raises his hand.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.720
Who is who and what is what not?

06:07.720 --> 06:12.720
She giggles to herself and gives a massive eye roll

06:13.200 --> 06:17.480
to the sports person and the news person who work here.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.760
And their names both start with S and their names are?

06:20.760 --> 06:23.160
Howard Chesh is the weatherman.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.280
Shay Star.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.640
And Shay Star, nice, well done.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.480
I knew Shay Star, that's two S's.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.400
It's two S's, Shay Star, well done.

06:31.400 --> 06:34.160
You said the meeting was at city tower, you called it?

06:34.160 --> 06:35.200
Yeah, the city tower.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.600
And it's shaped like the Teen Titans building.

06:39.920 --> 06:40.760
I'm here for that.

06:40.760 --> 06:41.600
You like that?

06:41.600 --> 06:42.440
Yeah, I like that.

06:42.440 --> 06:47.000
That's a little local reference for Springfield listeners.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.440
All four of us.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.840
Springfield is the headquarters of the Teen Titans.

06:50.840 --> 06:54.160
Dude, the Hammond's tower is the Teen Titans building.

06:54.160 --> 06:57.480
Yeah, but I was picturing the Teen Titans tower.

06:57.480 --> 06:59.240
Which is one in the same.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.400
Okay, no, it's not.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.400
It's similar looking.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.520
The Teen Titans is a giant T.

07:06.520 --> 07:10.600
And the Hammond's tower has giant T's

07:10.600 --> 07:12.320
on the side of all four sides.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.480
No, it has like.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.320
Anyway, Julius says.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.400
Slightly larger section at the top.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.960
It's like a big blob at the top.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.400
The T on top of the Teen Titans tower

07:21.400 --> 07:24.040
is literally as long as the building itself.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.040
I'm not saying that Hammond's tower

07:26.040 --> 07:29.160
looks exactly the same as Teen Titans tower,

07:29.160 --> 07:32.440
but I'm saying if Hammond's tower looks like anything,

07:32.440 --> 07:34.240
it looks like the Teen Titans tower.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.760
Luke, I got your back on that.

07:35.760 --> 07:39.760
That looks like a caricature of Hammond's tower.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.760
Joe, you're right, that looks exactly

07:41.760 --> 07:43.480
like the Teen Titans tower.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.360
You're right.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.320
Motherfuckers.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.000
The Hammond's tower is literally a giant T, bro.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.360
No, man, it's like an I with no bottom piece.

07:55.360 --> 07:58.600
It's like an I with no bottom piece, so like a T?

07:58.600 --> 08:02.360
No, man, how do you draw your I's?

08:02.360 --> 08:04.380
Like a T with a bottom T.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.440
Hey, guys, Google the Hammond's tower

08:08.440 --> 08:11.840
in Springfield, Missouri and tell me I'm not fucking wrong.

08:11.840 --> 08:15.480
Tell me, Google it, tweet at Luke Ginniman in 69.

08:15.480 --> 08:19.440
I know right I am, at indoor two underscores living.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.520
The Hammond's tower would be,

08:21.520 --> 08:23.000
the Hammond's tower looks like a T

08:23.000 --> 08:26.560
if you like chopped its arms off at the shoulder.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.200
I mean, look at this picture, it's a T.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.240
If you ignore most of the building.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.560
Okay, this is a stupid discussion.

08:33.560 --> 08:35.040
No, this is what the people wanna hear.

08:35.040 --> 08:36.840
They wanna hear about happiness.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.480
Yeah, look at that, right?

08:38.480 --> 08:39.960
I think that you would be hard pressed

08:39.960 --> 08:41.640
to find anybody who wouldn't go, huh,

08:42.480 --> 08:43.300
when you saw that.

08:43.300 --> 08:44.280
Huh, looks a lot like the teen Titan building.

08:44.280 --> 08:47.840
Joe has shown us a reasonably damning comparison.

08:47.840 --> 08:52.840
You guys just don't wanna believe the things I say

08:53.480 --> 08:55.440
cause guess what, I speak the truth.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.680
So he's busy at a meeting at the city tower,

09:00.680 --> 09:02.720
but you guys are here in the conference room

09:02.720 --> 09:05.000
at City Action News Studios,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.960
where Isabel Acaya is handing out the assignments.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.920
Okay, Cal, I actually got you something pretty great.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.400
It's an exclusive.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.480
Yeah, you with me?

09:15.480 --> 09:16.320
Asclusi.

09:16.320 --> 09:20.080
Yeah, oh, I love it when you use my language.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.200
Yes, you got Asclusi.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.080
Under his breath, he's like,

09:23.080 --> 09:24.660
I taught you to say Sclusi.

09:26.920 --> 09:29.880
Cal stabs his leg with his pin under the table.

09:32.560 --> 09:35.140
This Sclusi is just for you, Cal,

09:35.140 --> 09:36.520
and your whole team here.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.480
Just so you guys know,

09:38.480 --> 09:41.280
I'm texting my uncle to see what's up.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.840
He makes sure to interrupt her on that.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.100
Okay, are you done?

09:45.100 --> 09:48.080
Julius, it's not polite to interrupt, especially women.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.060
I act like I didn't say anything.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.680
Okay, weird.

09:54.560 --> 09:59.000
Okay, so yeah, it's Asclusi with the Gato company.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.840
It's Asclusi on the Gato company.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.960
Apparently they have this secret company town

10:03.960 --> 10:07.400
and someone out there is gonna show you around apparently.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.960
I don't know, Fred Gottel,

10:09.960 --> 10:11.480
and kind of the whole crowd is like,

10:11.480 --> 10:14.320
holy crap, won't be there.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.440
And everyone's like, ugh.

10:16.640 --> 10:21.080
As you know, he likes to be on camera as little as possible

10:21.080 --> 10:23.520
when he's not fully in control of the narrative,

10:23.520 --> 10:26.400
you know, as those big boys like to do.

10:26.400 --> 10:30.400
So there's actually just a dropped pin for the address.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.800
Not sure what that's about.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.640
Actually, this might just be like a wild goose chase,

10:34.640 --> 10:35.480
who knows?

10:35.480 --> 10:37.580
Like who dropped the pin, though?

10:37.580 --> 10:41.040
Can't reveal the source at this time, I'm being told.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.360
I mean, I could take a look at that

10:42.360 --> 10:45.400
and I might be able to find a trace

10:45.400 --> 10:48.020
of who maybe dropped the pin or whatever.

10:48.020 --> 10:49.680
Oh, okay, yeah, cool.

10:49.680 --> 10:53.000
On your way out, just see who was the PA,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.080
who was the intern who was running for you guys.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.680
Oh, that's a fantastic question.

10:56.680 --> 10:59.960
He can't look Julius in the eye right now

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
because of what happened during the printing press.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.120
Ha ha ha!

11:03.120 --> 11:04.680
He ripped my fucking...

11:04.680 --> 11:06.240
Yeah, it's the one who ripped your shirt off

11:06.240 --> 11:07.800
because he was like fucking plastic.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.920
During the rip, I can't wear that suit anymore.

11:10.920 --> 11:11.760
During the rip.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.200
I don't remember a lot from that night,

11:13.200 --> 11:16.120
but I do remember who did that to me.

11:16.120 --> 11:19.140
Somebody get the intern, what's his name?

11:19.140 --> 11:21.680
And literally no one in the room can remember his name.

11:21.680 --> 11:25.120
And this like very haphazard looking,

11:25.120 --> 11:27.400
bug-eyed boy comes running in.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.840
He's like, yeah, sorry, what did you guys want?

11:30.840 --> 11:35.040
You got the phone where we got the tip with the dropped pin?

11:35.040 --> 11:36.000
He's like, oh yeah.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.200
And he brings you a, who would it be from?

11:39.200 --> 11:40.200
Who would get the tip?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.080
Like who would have this dropped pin?

11:42.080 --> 11:46.560
There's just like the constant emails that come in

11:46.560 --> 11:49.000
and they scour through like what is the intern.

11:49.000 --> 11:49.840
The email goblin.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.800
All of the messages incoming from social media

11:51.800 --> 11:52.760
and stuff come to my phone.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.580
So yeah, it's this.

11:54.580 --> 11:55.680
And he hands you his phone

11:55.680 --> 11:57.760
and immediately disappears out of the room.

11:57.760 --> 12:01.200
Okay, yeah, so that's all I need from you guys

12:01.200 --> 12:02.300
if you wanna head out.

12:02.300 --> 12:06.680
That's, I think I read it was 83.6 miles away.

12:06.680 --> 12:08.000
So you're gonna wanna get out.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.700
That way you can get back in time.

12:09.700 --> 12:10.880
Cal is kind of confused.

12:10.880 --> 12:14.160
He's like, so we'll find the pin out there

12:14.160 --> 12:16.140
that someone dropped?

12:16.140 --> 12:18.920
Yeah, and she like smiles at the rest of the room.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.400
Julius gets up from his seat and looks at her

12:21.400 --> 12:26.400
and it's like, oh yeah, by the way, my uncle says hi.

12:27.640 --> 12:30.220
And he at no point has texted his uncle.

12:32.720 --> 12:35.200
She just kind of blinks at you for a second.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.280
Who are you?

12:37.200 --> 12:41.360
Julius makes a mental note and goes to walk near Cal.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.640
Oh, you're producing for Mr. Cal.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.120
Mr. Cal, have a good time.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.020
Bye.

12:47.020 --> 12:48.160
Thank you, Isabella.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.180
I certainly will.

12:49.180 --> 12:51.940
Can I catch the intern that's walking away?

12:51.940 --> 12:52.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:52.780 --> 12:55.140
As you guys head out out of the conference room

12:55.140 --> 12:57.220
and heading out towards the front door,

12:57.220 --> 12:59.940
you see him, he's pacing back and forth somewhere.

12:59.940 --> 13:01.460
He's just like talking to himself.

13:01.460 --> 13:02.940
I just kind of do a quick run up to him.

13:02.940 --> 13:05.340
Hey man, can I like check out the email that you got

13:05.340 --> 13:06.380
that had this pin in it?

13:06.380 --> 13:07.340
Yeah, absolutely.

13:07.340 --> 13:10.140
And he takes the phone from you and scrolls through it

13:10.140 --> 13:12.100
and clicks on it and hands it back to you.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.860
Perfect, then I'm gonna start searching this phone

13:14.860 --> 13:16.700
with either CompSci or Cygant.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.980
Oh yeah, go CompSci on it.

13:19.620 --> 13:20.460
Go computer science, please.

13:20.460 --> 13:23.220
I'm trying to find, go fucking CompSci on that phone.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.820
I'm doing like hackery stuff to find IP addresses

13:25.820 --> 13:27.420
and all sorts of things.

13:27.420 --> 13:30.420
In the meantime, I do want to text my uncle

13:30.420 --> 13:31.700
and like see what's up.

13:31.700 --> 13:34.180
Luke, you can text your uncle.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.300
That was always allowed.

13:35.300 --> 13:36.740
I know, that's why I just did it.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.260
Oh, he's doing it in game now though.

13:38.260 --> 13:39.900
Oh, oh.

13:39.900 --> 13:42.340
Could you text your actual uncle and tell him I say hi?

13:42.340 --> 13:43.620
Which one?

13:43.620 --> 13:44.460
Either.

13:44.460 --> 13:47.680
Dave or, I'm not gonna text Dave, fuck Dave.

13:47.680 --> 13:48.520
No, text Dave.

13:49.000 --> 13:49.840
I'll text Donny.

13:49.840 --> 13:50.680
Donny's a cool one.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.080
Luke gave the shocker when he said that.

13:55.840 --> 13:56.680
Joe, what'd you roll?

13:56.680 --> 13:58.560
There's a 65 on a 60.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.240
Oh, do you want to spend luck?

14:01.240 --> 14:02.140
I ain't got it.

14:02.140 --> 14:05.280
Oh, shit.

14:05.280 --> 14:10.040
Okay, for some reason it's coming from a blocked IP.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.880
It seems that it was run through.

14:11.880 --> 14:16.880
You can tell it's actually a specific IP that VPNs use

14:17.040 --> 14:18.920
and you recognize it as being like,

14:18.920 --> 14:20.840
oh, they blocked where they came from.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.720
Ah, dang, this guy's a little bit tricky, guys.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.220
We might want to have our wits about us.

14:26.220 --> 14:29.040
I don't know if this is like above board or whatever

14:29.040 --> 14:31.000
because they're like hiding their tracks.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
He's a little bit tricky,

14:32.000 --> 14:33.760
but I'm a little bit rock and roll.

14:33.760 --> 14:34.920
I think we can do it.

14:34.920 --> 14:38.640
I've actually just texted my uncle

14:38.640 --> 14:42.240
to see if he has any information about this story.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.240
I mean, at the end of the day,

14:43.240 --> 14:45.480
it's like a follow-up to the story we did in the corn

14:45.480 --> 14:46.760
in the crab farm, right?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.520
Cal like gives you a pained expression for a second

14:49.520 --> 14:50.840
thinking about that day.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.720
I suppose so.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.860
I was also speaking in jest earlier.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.140
I prefer jazz.

14:57.440 --> 14:58.280
Oh, I know.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.440
I knew it was a joke, dude.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.440
It was a good one, man.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.680
Oh, thank you.

15:02.680 --> 15:03.720
Anchor good?

15:03.720 --> 15:05.640
Oh, dude, of course, anchor good.

15:05.640 --> 15:06.760
Thank you, Beck.

15:06.760 --> 15:09.680
Either way, we should definitely get out there.

15:09.680 --> 15:13.720
The door of the conference room swings open wide real quick

15:13.720 --> 15:15.560
and Isabelle Lacaya is standing there

15:15.600 --> 15:17.840
and she's like, oh yeah, shit, one more thing,

15:17.840 --> 15:20.120
completely forgot, slipped my mind.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.320
We figured you might need another pair of hands

15:22.320 --> 15:24.440
since this seems like whatever.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.400
You don't know what it is.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.280
So we figured since you're out for the day,

15:28.280 --> 15:31.160
we'll send a PA with you.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.440
She said her name was Stevie

15:33.440 --> 15:36.200
and then Isabelle Lacaya disappears

15:36.200 --> 15:37.580
back into the conference room.

15:37.580 --> 15:40.480
And you see Stevie is a scrawny little dude

15:40.480 --> 15:42.640
wearing cigarette-legged jeans

15:42.640 --> 15:44.800
in an oversized black hoodie.

15:44.880 --> 15:48.640
She has earbuds plugged into her ear holes

15:48.640 --> 15:51.720
and a thick wall of dark wavy hair

15:51.720 --> 15:54.720
covering their eyes, nose, and top lip

15:54.720 --> 15:59.540
only revealing a black lipstick-covered bottom lip

15:59.540 --> 16:01.480
pierced with a small hoop.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.880
And you say they don't have ears, just holes?

16:05.720 --> 16:08.520
Well, the earbuds themselves are plugged into the holes.

16:08.520 --> 16:11.100
There are the flappy parts around.

16:11.100 --> 16:11.940
Hi.

16:13.740 --> 16:17.580
Hello, Stevie, your ears are normally flappy.

16:17.580 --> 16:18.940
I'm Cal Colorado.

16:18.940 --> 16:21.620
Hi, Mr. Colorado, it's nice to meet you.

16:21.620 --> 16:23.860
I'm Stevie, can I get you anything?

16:23.860 --> 16:26.100
Hi, Stevie, it's nice to meet you guys.

16:26.100 --> 16:27.260
What's your name?

16:27.260 --> 16:29.080
Is this the first time that Beck would've met this person?

16:29.080 --> 16:30.360
Because it sounds like somebody

16:30.360 --> 16:32.060
who Beck would be friends with, for sure.

16:32.060 --> 16:34.380
Yeah, this is a new, you've known it.

16:34.380 --> 16:36.060
Hey, Stevie, what's going on?

16:36.060 --> 16:36.900
Good to meet you.

16:36.900 --> 16:38.500
Hi, yeah, it's nice to meet you too.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.840
I like your vibe.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.360
I'm digging yours too.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.200
Nice, hi there.

16:44.200 --> 16:47.720
Julius is like very intensely looking at his phone,

16:47.720 --> 16:50.680
like trying to figure stuff out before we leave.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.220
I'm Stevie.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.320
Take him back Sunday?

16:55.060 --> 16:55.900
Okay.

16:55.900 --> 16:57.180
Like Chick-fil-A?

16:58.220 --> 17:00.160
Take him back Sunday. Julius looks back up at-

17:00.160 --> 17:01.640
Like Chick-fil-A.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.800
Julius looks back up at Stevie

17:03.800 --> 17:07.320
having no idea what Chick-fil-A means.

17:07.320 --> 17:09.240
Dude, taking him back Sunday like Chick-fil-A

17:09.240 --> 17:12.380
would be a pretty good Christian Kanye lyric.

17:13.880 --> 17:16.200
That would be really good on one of his Jesus songs.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.720
Luke finally gets it.

17:19.920 --> 17:24.200
Julius, absolutely not, looks back up and just says,

17:24.200 --> 17:25.680
make damn sure.

17:25.680 --> 17:26.880
Yeah, nice.

17:26.880 --> 17:30.200
And he just goes back to texting on his phone.

17:30.200 --> 17:34.200
Julius is preoccupied with his important work,

17:34.200 --> 17:36.480
but I'm sure you'll gel quite well with the team.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.280
We're happy to have you along today.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.160
Thank you, Mr. Colorado, sir.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.840
It's nice to meet a legend such as yourself.

17:43.680 --> 17:44.520
Thank you.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.500
Thank you, young person.

17:45.500 --> 17:48.940
And to work underneath you and Mr. Wilder here,

17:48.940 --> 17:53.360
who has, I mean, a long and storied history

17:53.360 --> 17:55.360
as a grade-A cameraman.

17:55.360 --> 17:58.400
Oh, dude, my reputation precedes me.

17:58.400 --> 18:02.780
And I'm sure Mr. Summers here will prove himself worthy

18:02.780 --> 18:05.800
of a producer title for the two of you.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.680
Julius's ears perk up at that

18:08.680 --> 18:10.360
and he puts his phone in his pocket.

18:10.360 --> 18:11.480
He's like, yes.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.320
Do you guys want any drinks before we get going?

18:14.320 --> 18:16.400
Any caffeinated beverages?

18:16.400 --> 18:20.020
Yeah, dude, I'll take one of my energy drink.

18:20.020 --> 18:21.420
Totally.

18:21.420 --> 18:23.040
I would love a Coca-Cola.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.160
And for you, Mr. Summers?

18:25.160 --> 18:27.600
Do you have black water?

18:27.600 --> 18:29.360
Yeah, I'm sure I could find some.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.960
If not, I'll take energy drink.

18:31.960 --> 18:36.240
Okay, I'll meet you guys out of the van.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.300
City energy drink.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.620
The energy drink that just gets you by.

18:43.240 --> 18:46.160
Just enough juice not to blow your brains out.

18:46.160 --> 18:47.800
I'll meet you guys out of the van.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.700
Yeah, I think we head down to the van,

18:49.700 --> 18:51.840
but it's kind of eaten up at Beck

18:51.840 --> 18:53.360
that he couldn't crack that phone.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.880
He felt like this was an easy thing.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.520
You find out who sent a pin.

18:56.520 --> 18:58.320
That's like iPhone shit.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.480
That's just basic shit.

19:00.520 --> 19:02.160
Damn, that hurts.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.040
As Julius gets down to the van,

19:04.040 --> 19:07.040
he wants to drive, but he's gonna wait and see

19:07.040 --> 19:09.660
if the intern is gonna try to drive or not.

19:09.660 --> 19:11.400
Well, you guys, just the three of you out there.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.240
Oh, just three of us?

19:12.240 --> 19:13.640
Yeah, while she's grabbing your drinks.

19:13.640 --> 19:16.940
Cal is looking over Beck's shoulder at the phone

19:16.940 --> 19:19.120
and he points at the pin.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.100
What's this pin?

19:20.100 --> 19:21.880
Is that where the pin is?

19:21.880 --> 19:23.400
Yeah, man, that's exactly right.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.220
You nailed it.

19:24.220 --> 19:25.160
That's where we're going.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.340
Somebody told us that this is where we gotta go

19:27.340 --> 19:29.640
and this is like a visual representation of that.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.040
Because there's a pin there.

19:31.040 --> 19:35.520
Yeah, you know when you're looking at a map on a wall

19:35.520 --> 19:37.740
and you're saying, hey, I've been there before,

19:37.740 --> 19:39.480
so you take a thumbtack and you put it in there?

19:39.480 --> 19:41.680
Oh, yes, I see the pin on your phone.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.520
It's like that.

19:42.520 --> 19:43.440
That's where the pin is?

19:43.440 --> 19:45.520
Beck, could I take a look?

19:45.520 --> 19:46.360
Sure.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.720
And he hands Julius the phone.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.560
Somebody give me a ones dice, please.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.320
A ones, just a ones?

19:53.320 --> 19:54.680
Computer science, baby.

19:54.680 --> 19:59.480
Julius hands the phone back to Beck.

19:59.480 --> 20:02.360
I, yeah, don't know.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.920
I said, oh shit, because he rolled a 65 also.

20:05.920 --> 20:06.760
I don't know if that's.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.920
Oh, I thought you said, oh shit, because he nailed it.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.100
Even with luck, I wouldn't pass my roll.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.200
Back to the conversation Beck and Colorado having.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.160
I'm worried that you think that we're gonna go there

20:16.160 --> 20:18.480
and find a physical pin there?

20:18.480 --> 20:19.320
And that's not the case.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.020
Yes, someone dropped a pin

20:21.020 --> 20:23.320
and it's the key to unraveling the Gato Corporation.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.520
Now I see what you were asking.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.540
For sure, dude, no.

20:25.540 --> 20:28.640
So there's not a physical pin when we get there.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.800
This is just like the lingo we use today

20:30.800 --> 20:32.840
to say like, go to a place.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.120
You dropped a pen.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.600
Yeah, yeah, kinda.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.960
And this pin is where that pen is?

20:37.960 --> 20:40.040
Yeah, but there's not a pin there.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.640
Cal, there's a. There's a pen.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.440
There's a pin.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.720
Cal, there's a application on your phone

20:46.720 --> 20:50.720
called either Google Maps or Apple Maps.

20:54.080 --> 20:57.920
When you go to show somebody.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.480
Yes, my daughter drops pins to me all the time.

21:00.480 --> 21:05.480
That's the pin that we're talking about.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.880
And this is a pin to the pen.

21:08.880 --> 21:09.880
There's no pin.

21:10.880 --> 21:11.720
Other than.

21:11.720 --> 21:12.560
Let's not rule out the fact

21:12.560 --> 21:14.680
that there could be a pin there, dude.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.660
You guys turn back from this conversation

21:16.660 --> 21:21.040
and Stevie Gotel is closing the door to the can van

21:21.040 --> 21:23.400
after getting in the driver's seat and.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.280
Stevie Gotel?

21:24.280 --> 21:25.720
Did you mess that up?

21:25.720 --> 21:27.120
Or is that just a slip of the tongue?

21:27.240 --> 21:29.360
Oh, that's a slip of the tongue.

21:29.360 --> 21:32.640
Stevie gets you out to the Gotel company.

21:32.640 --> 21:35.180
This MPC seemed really cool,

21:35.180 --> 21:37.920
but I didn't realize they were a fucking plant

21:37.920 --> 21:39.200
for the Gotel board.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.920
Can I go pee and then figure out

21:41.920 --> 21:45.200
what I'm gonna do with a Gotel in our van?

21:45.200 --> 21:46.320
Go for it.

21:46.320 --> 21:47.480
I don't actually have to pee.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.320
I'm just kidding.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.160
We're gonna stick a pin in them.

21:49.160 --> 21:50.600
My eyes got so big.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.000
Sorry about that, Jesus.

21:54.880 --> 21:55.960
Just yes and it.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.120
Oh yes, she's a Gotel.

21:58.120 --> 21:58.960
Cool.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.740
Season two, almost over.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.560
We have your grandchild.

22:08.420 --> 22:09.980
We know about the pen.

22:12.080 --> 22:12.920
No!

22:18.080 --> 22:20.080
We have your grandchild.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.760
We know about the pen.

22:21.760 --> 22:22.680
Let's get going.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.560
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

22:25.560 --> 22:26.920
Honk, honk, beep, beep.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.880
As you guys turn away from this conversation

22:28.880 --> 22:31.560
that you're having, you notice that Stevie

22:31.560 --> 22:34.600
has gotten into the driver's seat of the can van

22:34.600 --> 22:39.040
and has slammed the door and started the can van.

22:39.040 --> 22:42.060
And she rolls down the window and is like,

22:42.060 --> 22:45.840
hey everybody, I've got your drinks ready in here for you.

22:45.840 --> 22:49.200
Cal nods approvingly and then says to everybody else,

22:49.200 --> 22:51.200
get in losers, we're making news.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.040
All right, Cal.

22:56.200 --> 22:59.280
Yeah, Julius hops in and he's scrolling through TikTok

22:59.280 --> 23:00.800
to see like what kind of cool stuff

23:00.800 --> 23:02.700
we can do for a TikTok this time.

23:04.460 --> 23:07.160
Awesome, because I haven't talked to my uncle recently,

23:07.160 --> 23:09.200
but I'm sure that that's what he wants.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.440
I've pretended to many times.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.820
For sake of you not screwing us over later,

23:15.820 --> 23:18.880
the van is stocked with all my equipment already.

23:18.880 --> 23:21.080
Oh Joe, you forgot to pack your camera.

23:21.080 --> 23:24.060
Actually, yeah, sorry, you didn't roll to check

23:24.060 --> 23:25.800
if the van had been robbed

23:25.800 --> 23:27.900
while it was parked outside the studio.

23:28.760 --> 23:31.600
Luke never said he actually got into the van.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.600
So how are you guys doing with that Julius?

23:36.600 --> 23:37.920
He's back at the station.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.600
You were very good about like not jamming like that.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.640
He's pretending to text his uncle.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.640
That's just the thing, don't do that to your players.

23:45.640 --> 23:48.040
If you're like a role player, like,

23:48.040 --> 23:51.580
oh, you forgot to say Simon Says.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.440
Yeah, don't play fucking Simon Says with your players.

23:55.440 --> 23:58.200
That's a great rule of thumb for role playing.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.200
Can I reiterate out of character real fast?

24:00.200 --> 24:01.680
Isabelle Crane has, or.

24:01.680 --> 24:02.520
Isabella Caya.

24:02.520 --> 24:05.880
Isabella Caya has, can I reiterate real quick?

24:05.880 --> 24:08.680
Isabella Caya has sent us to investigate

24:08.680 --> 24:12.480
a secret company town, which is really fucking exciting

24:12.480 --> 24:14.720
and weird and crazy.

24:14.720 --> 24:15.560
Okay, cool.

24:15.560 --> 24:18.880
Julius is stoked, but preoccupied with his uncle.

24:18.880 --> 24:20.840
You're like looking at fucking TikTok.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.940
Well, I'm like, why did I have to find this out

24:23.940 --> 24:26.940
from Isabella Caya and not my uncle?

24:26.940 --> 24:31.200
But then also looking up the songs we should use

24:31.200 --> 24:33.440
in the background of our TikTok once we make.

24:33.440 --> 24:36.640
Exactly, yeah, like trending hashtags today and.

24:36.640 --> 24:39.460
Stevie notices that there are some very cool

24:39.460 --> 24:42.100
driving gloves sitting up on the dash.

24:42.100 --> 24:45.500
Oh, sorry, does someone else normally drive?

24:45.500 --> 24:48.260
Julius kind of glances up and just goes,

24:48.260 --> 24:49.420
put them on.

24:49.420 --> 24:51.780
Oh, may I?

24:51.780 --> 24:52.620
Put them on.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.620
And she gets a plus 10 drive.

24:58.620 --> 24:59.960
Oh, fuck yeah, she does.

25:01.140 --> 25:02.420
And she rolled an aught too.

25:02.420 --> 25:03.460
Yeah, tight.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.020
Nice.

25:05.020 --> 25:07.300
Okay, so you guys head outside of the city.

25:07.300 --> 25:11.620
Immediately your can van jammed in this city traffic

25:12.060 --> 25:14.340
just right off the bat and it takes a while

25:14.340 --> 25:16.520
to get out into the interstate.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.380
And Stevie's staying pretty quiet

25:18.380 --> 25:20.000
until you get out on the highway.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.340
But once you're out, she kind of looks

25:22.340 --> 25:25.260
in the rear view mirror and she's like.

25:25.260 --> 25:28.780
So do you guys, do you guys believe in ghosts?

25:28.780 --> 25:29.960
Yeah, dude, yeah.

25:29.960 --> 25:30.900
Oh, for real?

25:30.900 --> 25:31.740
Yeah.

25:31.740 --> 25:32.560
Have you seen one?

25:32.560 --> 25:33.400
No.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.240
Oh.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.140
Some people at the station would tell you

25:36.140 --> 25:37.400
you're looking at one.

25:39.360 --> 25:40.200
Hi, kid.

25:40.200 --> 25:44.720
I mean, I've seen things that they could be, dude.

25:44.720 --> 25:48.240
What sort of ghosts are you talking about?

25:48.240 --> 25:50.040
Oh, I just mean anything.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.840
Do you guys think aliens are?

25:51.840 --> 25:54.760
I'm just like, I just want to know

25:54.760 --> 25:57.160
where your mind's at, you know?

25:57.160 --> 25:59.800
You'd be like stupid not to believe in aliens.

25:59.800 --> 26:02.500
Just probabilities or whatever, my dudes.

26:02.500 --> 26:03.720
They gotta be out there.

26:03.720 --> 26:08.640
I, you know, in college decided that they're out there.

26:08.640 --> 26:09.640
Nice.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.120
I want to believe.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.460
Whoa, that's like Mulder, dude.

26:13.460 --> 26:14.300
Who?

26:14.300 --> 26:16.360
It's like a spooky dude who's like

26:16.360 --> 26:17.720
into spooky stuff on a show.

26:17.720 --> 26:18.640
You're like that dude.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.000
Well, I am on a show.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.960
Oh yeah, it's like double that way, yeah.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.960
A pleasant conversation is always Beck.

26:26.880 --> 26:30.240
The conversation continues and veers off

26:30.240 --> 26:34.000
into different directions and then it kind of dies down

26:34.000 --> 26:37.680
again and she gets that same sort of sound in her voice

26:37.720 --> 26:40.680
and she's like, well, what do you guys think about like,

26:40.680 --> 26:44.360
do you think it's possible to be like rich

26:44.360 --> 26:46.000
and be a good person?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.960
Like, do you think money corrupts absolutely?

26:48.960 --> 26:53.540
Are you talking about Godel money or like?

26:53.540 --> 26:54.380
Well, I mean.

26:54.380 --> 26:55.920
More money than you make.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.180
Well, certainly more money than I make,

26:58.180 --> 27:00.020
but I mean, if we're heading out to talk about.

27:00.020 --> 27:02.720
Well, we all certainly make a lot more money than you,

27:02.720 --> 27:05.080
but does that make us bad people?

27:05.080 --> 27:06.640
Well, I guess that's what I'm asking.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.320
Do you think that making more money

27:08.320 --> 27:09.880
has made you a worse person?

27:09.880 --> 27:12.240
There was this one time where like I was like

27:12.240 --> 27:14.600
putting on a coat for like the first time I had

27:14.600 --> 27:19.240
like for all year and in that pocket there was 20 bucks

27:19.240 --> 27:22.080
and I took that 20 bucks and I took Cal

27:22.080 --> 27:24.880
and our old producer out to the foundry

27:24.880 --> 27:26.920
and I got them all shots with it.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.880
So I mean, I guess I'm kind of a case in point

27:28.880 --> 27:31.440
that it doesn't have to corrupt absolutely.

27:31.440 --> 27:33.780
I was rich and I helped my friends.

27:34.620 --> 27:36.500
Wise words, Beckworth.

27:38.280 --> 27:39.180
I like that.

27:39.180 --> 27:40.780
Godel money though.

27:40.780 --> 27:42.940
Yeah, what about like Godel money?

27:42.940 --> 27:43.820
Godel money though.

27:43.820 --> 27:45.180
Well, it's a good thing none of us

27:45.180 --> 27:46.500
have to worry about that.

27:48.180 --> 27:52.180
Yeah, for sure.

27:53.700 --> 27:54.540
Humit?

27:56.380 --> 27:58.900
Humit on Cal for having that much money?

27:58.900 --> 28:01.580
No, I'm saying that as like I remember.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.460
Oh, I thought it was Julius, I'm sorry.

28:04.060 --> 28:07.100
Julius is related to the person that owns the news network.

28:10.100 --> 28:13.460
And I got my job because they own the news network.

28:13.460 --> 28:15.980
I don't think that's like Godel money though.

28:15.980 --> 28:16.820
No, it's not.

28:16.820 --> 28:20.740
That's like Monsanto money versus KY3 money.

28:20.740 --> 28:25.740
Well, like better than KY3, but not like generational

28:26.640 --> 28:27.480
billions.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.300
No.

28:28.300 --> 28:29.140
Exactly.

28:29.140 --> 28:30.940
But Julius likes to think that it is.

28:31.820 --> 28:34.980
I think you're gonna be just fine.

28:34.980 --> 28:36.060
I'll be okay.

28:36.060 --> 28:38.740
Just not enough to be a super villain.

28:38.740 --> 28:39.640
How has it affected you?

28:39.640 --> 28:43.500
I believe that I'm rich and you can tell from like

28:43.500 --> 28:44.540
what I've said that.

28:44.540 --> 28:46.340
We're all rich Luke in friendship.

28:46.340 --> 28:48.940
You know that like Julius knows he's rich.

28:48.940 --> 28:49.780
Okay.

28:49.780 --> 28:52.740
But like he doesn't want you guys to know that,

28:52.740 --> 28:53.820
but now you do.

28:54.740 --> 28:56.700
Doesn't want us to know it or doesn't want us

28:56.700 --> 28:58.580
to treat you differently because of it?

28:58.580 --> 29:00.580
The first because of the second.

29:01.460 --> 29:04.080
When you're about an hour outside the city,

29:04.080 --> 29:07.040
you exit the interstate to a highway,

29:07.040 --> 29:10.700
to a smaller highway, to a country road,

29:10.700 --> 29:12.740
to another country road.

29:12.740 --> 29:17.100
And the only signs around are for attractions behind you

29:17.100 --> 29:19.860
with an easy place to turn around

29:19.860 --> 29:22.260
within a minute of each sign.

29:22.260 --> 29:25.780
And eventually the country road goes from asphalt

29:25.900 --> 29:30.900
to gravel and a sign says road closed ahead,

29:31.100 --> 29:32.960
please turn back.

29:32.960 --> 29:36.620
Are we still on track to like where it's telling us to go?

29:36.620 --> 29:37.920
Yeah, how far are we from the pen?

29:37.920 --> 29:40.780
Stevie pulls up the navigation on her phone

29:40.780 --> 29:43.500
and kind of holds it up near the rear view mirror

29:43.500 --> 29:44.420
to show you guys.

29:44.420 --> 29:47.500
And it's like, it says we're still going the right way.

29:47.500 --> 29:48.620
Should I just keep going?

29:48.620 --> 29:49.540
How far?

29:49.540 --> 29:52.740
It looks like less than a mile.

29:52.740 --> 29:54.740
Keep forward going.

29:54.740 --> 29:55.980
Okay.

29:55.980 --> 29:58.460
And she keeps driving and keeps going.

29:58.460 --> 30:01.780
It twists, it turns, it's a gravel road.

30:01.780 --> 30:03.960
The gravel road turns to dirt.

30:03.960 --> 30:07.260
And at this point, there's just no signs anywhere.

30:07.260 --> 30:09.340
There haven't been like streetlights

30:09.340 --> 30:11.740
for miles at this point.

30:11.740 --> 30:16.740
Here you see a sign that says stop dead end, no outlet.

30:17.100 --> 30:21.180
I'm still going though.

30:21.180 --> 30:23.140
There's another sign up there.

30:23.140 --> 30:25.140
She points and as you guys approach that one,

30:25.140 --> 30:28.420
it says danger road closed.

30:28.420 --> 30:30.620
I think these signs are designed

30:30.620 --> 30:33.380
merely to keep looky-loos out.

30:33.380 --> 30:34.960
But we're the looky news.

30:36.620 --> 30:39.360
She's like nervously laughing at that hilarious joke.

30:39.360 --> 30:40.980
At this point, Beck is, like I said,

30:40.980 --> 30:42.760
he's always taking B-roll out the windows and stuff.

30:42.760 --> 30:44.720
But at this point, he's kind of crawled up to the front

30:44.720 --> 30:46.580
between the passenger and the driver

30:46.580 --> 30:48.180
and is filming out the front,

30:48.180 --> 30:49.660
getting good shots of what we're seeing

30:49.660 --> 30:50.500
as it's coming up on us.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.780
Stevie, I think that you should just keep driving.

30:53.780 --> 30:58.260
The road turns and suddenly you see that the road stops.

30:58.260 --> 31:03.260
The dirt turns into a thick wall of brush.

31:03.860 --> 31:08.400
So thick, so tall that you can't see through or over it.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.680
And it goes left and right in all directions.

31:10.680 --> 31:12.000
And it's actually so thick,

31:12.000 --> 31:13.420
almost on either side of the road

31:13.420 --> 31:16.220
that you wouldn't be able to walk too far into it

31:16.220 --> 31:21.140
before you're waist high in verdant detritus.

31:21.140 --> 31:22.860
Waist high, though?

31:22.860 --> 31:24.420
Yeah, after a little bit, yeah.

31:24.420 --> 31:25.340
It'd be about waist high.

31:25.340 --> 31:26.180
So we can see over it?

31:26.180 --> 31:27.060
Oh, no, no, no, sorry.

31:27.060 --> 31:28.740
On the left and right, it's waist high.

31:28.740 --> 31:32.420
Ahead of you, it's like three stories high

31:32.420 --> 31:34.560
of just thicket and trees.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.760
And there's kudzu laying over the top of these trees

31:37.760 --> 31:39.260
so thick that you can't see through it.

31:39.260 --> 31:40.560
Does it seem natural?

31:40.560 --> 31:42.700
Does anyone have any sort of science role

31:42.700 --> 31:45.380
or knowledge about plant life?

31:45.380 --> 31:47.700
You can roll me an intelligence at a negative 40

31:47.700 --> 31:48.940
if you'd like.

31:48.940 --> 31:49.780
I'll try it.

31:49.780 --> 31:50.600
I'll do that.

31:52.900 --> 31:53.740
98.

31:58.420 --> 32:00.180
It's a fail no matter what I get.

32:00.180 --> 32:01.420
How many did you say minus?

32:01.420 --> 32:02.300
40.

32:02.300 --> 32:05.140
Yeah, that would put me at a 30 and I rolled a 34.

32:05.140 --> 32:06.380
Oof. Very close.

32:06.380 --> 32:07.520
Ouchie.

32:07.520 --> 32:11.500
So you're not sure whether this plant life

32:11.500 --> 32:13.100
naturally grows in this area,

32:13.100 --> 32:17.300
but it's growing right next to all this other stuff.

32:17.300 --> 32:20.880
It seems seamless as it grows into it all, so.

32:20.880 --> 32:25.880
Do you guys know if we have a license to film in Egypt?

32:26.980 --> 32:31.020
I get it, butt fucking Egypt, where we are.

32:31.020 --> 32:34.620
I'm not sure that's the correct term,

32:34.620 --> 32:36.740
but that was the joke.

32:36.740 --> 32:37.980
What is the correct term?

32:37.980 --> 32:40.380
Bum fuck Egypt.

32:40.380 --> 32:42.860
No, it's butt fucking Egypt.

32:43.460 --> 32:44.300
If we're talking out of character.

32:44.300 --> 32:45.500
It's bum fuck Egypt.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.860
If we're talking out of character.

32:47.860 --> 32:49.700
I mean, hey, I looked at the tower,

32:49.700 --> 32:51.500
you were totally right about that, but.

32:51.500 --> 32:52.340
Oh.

32:54.500 --> 32:55.940
Redemption.

32:55.940 --> 32:59.380
BFE stands for either bum fuck or butt fuck Egypt.

33:01.460 --> 33:03.220
So we're both right.

33:03.220 --> 33:05.780
Somebody on a Reddit thread says bout fucking Egypt,

33:05.780 --> 33:06.940
which is just dumb.

33:06.940 --> 33:08.040
That's Reddit, baby.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.340
It's gotta be about your butt, you know,

33:10.340 --> 33:11.840
because that's what you fuck.

33:12.860 --> 33:16.300
Does your butt hurt?

33:16.300 --> 33:17.700
Do you want it to?

33:22.260 --> 33:23.580
Julius makes that joke,

33:23.580 --> 33:26.420
and then like whether or not Cal liked it,

33:26.420 --> 33:28.780
he feels a deeper connection to Cal,

33:28.780 --> 33:32.540
but also has no idea if these plants are real or not.

33:32.540 --> 33:33.780
We've stopped the van at this point.

33:33.780 --> 33:34.620
Yeah, it's.

33:34.620 --> 33:35.660
Like the road has ended.

33:35.660 --> 33:40.660
Yeah, but the pen shows on the other side of this like wall.

33:40.860 --> 33:43.580
Beck wants to get out and take a camera

33:43.580 --> 33:45.540
and go as close to the thicket as he can

33:45.540 --> 33:47.280
and just kind of shove the lens in there

33:47.280 --> 33:51.180
and do a big, as hard, as big a zoom as he can on this lens.

33:51.180 --> 33:52.800
And just see if he sees,

33:52.800 --> 33:55.040
if the lens penetrates better than his eyes can,

33:55.040 --> 33:55.880
what's ahead.

33:55.880 --> 33:59.660
Okay, go ahead and roll video.

33:59.660 --> 34:00.700
Videographer.

34:02.020 --> 34:03.060
While he rolls that,

34:03.060 --> 34:05.500
can I roll to see if I can find like a,

34:05.500 --> 34:07.860
something to cut through these vines?

34:07.860 --> 34:10.300
Are you fucking kidding me, dude?

34:10.740 --> 34:12.980
I have an 80 in this and I rolled a 90.

34:12.980 --> 34:13.820
No.

34:15.420 --> 34:16.660
God damn it.

34:16.660 --> 34:18.920
So as you shove it into there,

34:18.920 --> 34:22.780
you feel that it gets almost like trapped in a spot

34:22.780 --> 34:26.340
where some sticks were facing out away from you.

34:26.340 --> 34:28.980
You kind of pushed it in where it kind of latches back

34:28.980 --> 34:31.660
onto them as you try to pull the camera back out,

34:31.660 --> 34:34.240
but you're able to kind of wrestle it out

34:34.240 --> 34:36.800
without damaging the camera at all.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.360
And as you look at through the viewfinder

34:39.360 --> 34:41.280
of what you just shot while it was

34:41.280 --> 34:43.220
out of your view completely,

34:44.060 --> 34:48.480
you see that it zooms into a leaf.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.200
As this happens, Julius is like,

34:52.200 --> 34:53.560
he's the new producer.

34:53.560 --> 34:58.240
He wants to just like get to the story as fast as possible.

34:58.240 --> 35:01.320
And thank you, I knocked my ones off earlier.

35:03.040 --> 35:08.040
Will a two find me something to cut through this in the van?

35:08.040 --> 35:09.000
Yeah, a two will.

35:09.520 --> 35:13.440
So what is in the van that can cut through some thick brush?

35:13.440 --> 35:16.560
With the two, there's a machete in there for some reason.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.220
No, so the van used to have-

35:21.220 --> 35:24.920
Giant scythes on the wheels there still.

35:24.920 --> 35:28.000
The van used to have like little like curtains.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.280
Forward, Stevie.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.960
The van used to have curtains in the back

35:31.960 --> 35:35.280
so that like people could edit in the back while they drove.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.760
But now there's just no windows.

35:37.760 --> 35:40.640
And for six months, Beck lived in there.

35:40.640 --> 35:43.280
Laying down underneath one of the seats,

35:43.280 --> 35:46.160
there's like the slider thing that the-

35:46.160 --> 35:47.160
Curtain rod.

35:47.160 --> 35:48.800
The curtain rod, yeah.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.240
So I grabbed the curtain rod.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.240
Yeah, so you grab the curtain rod

35:52.240 --> 35:54.000
and you start swiping through.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.280
And as you're doing that,

35:55.280 --> 35:57.640
Stevie's kind of gotten out of the van as well

35:57.640 --> 35:59.720
and is putting her hands in it

35:59.720 --> 36:02.560
and just kind of like moving them around.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.720
I don't know, maybe there's something here.

36:04.720 --> 36:06.400
And then you guys hear a boom.

36:07.920 --> 36:11.360
Julius, you feel like you've connected

36:11.360 --> 36:15.480
with something thick and steel with this rod.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.240
Like it feels like metal on metal.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.080
Yeah.

36:18.080 --> 36:18.920
Oh shit.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.920
Yeah, we're talking certain parts

36:20.920 --> 36:24.200
of the periodic table in your hands here.

36:24.200 --> 36:27.600
Have I like, like before I hit the metal, did I cut-

36:27.600 --> 36:28.440
The hard parts.

36:29.560 --> 36:33.000
Before I hit the metal, did I like cut any like foliage?

36:33.000 --> 36:35.520
Yeah, I mean, you can keep kind of pushing it away

36:35.520 --> 36:36.760
from where you've dunked

36:36.760 --> 36:41.000
and you can see that there's a bit of steel,

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
the plant life growing up on it and around it.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.800
As soon as Beck heard the dunk,

36:45.800 --> 36:46.920
he would have whipped around

36:46.920 --> 36:48.880
and started filming what's going on there.

36:48.880 --> 36:49.720
Yeah.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.160
Yeah, Julius is just gonna use the curtain rod

36:51.160 --> 36:55.600
to try to like scrape stuff off of the like metal

36:55.600 --> 36:59.240
that he hit to like try to reveal whatever it is.

36:59.240 --> 37:04.240
And as you do so, you notice that there seems to be

37:04.480 --> 37:08.280
some paint on the steel.

37:08.280 --> 37:10.880
As you push the thicket and brush

37:10.880 --> 37:14.200
and all of this plant life out of the way

37:14.200 --> 37:19.080
with your curtain rod,

37:19.080 --> 37:21.440
you push enough away to show

37:21.440 --> 37:25.960
where this paint on the steel is showing.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.400
There's actually an arrow and you reveal an arrow

37:28.400 --> 37:29.720
that's pointing to the left.

37:29.720 --> 37:32.800
And as you push more away, there's above it,

37:32.840 --> 37:34.360
it says door.

37:34.360 --> 37:35.520
What color arrow?

37:35.520 --> 37:37.480
You move some more, it's a yellow arrow.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.040
I knew it was gonna be yellow.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.320
Fuck, it's a green arrow.

37:40.320 --> 37:41.560
Oh, okay.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.720
Yeah, that makes sense if you're wanting to hide it.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.240
And green is pretty industrial and like a...

37:46.240 --> 37:47.680
Yeah, good choice.

37:47.680 --> 37:51.200
And like a modern evil corporation

37:51.200 --> 37:53.400
that wants to hide that it's an evil corporation.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.240
That's right.

37:54.240 --> 37:57.200
Yellow on like steel is just classic bad guy shit.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.800
I look at Beck, obviously just like pointing

37:59.800 --> 38:02.760
to like get some footage of what I've just revealed.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.440
Beck sets up a nice shot that has it centered.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.280
Perfect.

38:06.280 --> 38:07.680
Yeah, I wanna just start clearing

38:07.680 --> 38:10.160
whether it's like scraping or swiping

38:10.160 --> 38:11.800
or whatever I need to do

38:11.800 --> 38:14.400
to get to where that arrow is pointing.

38:14.400 --> 38:19.400
And the sun is coming into full force.

38:20.040 --> 38:24.560
It's about 1030 a.m. now on this July 5th.

38:24.560 --> 38:26.200
But it's gonna be cloudy later in the day

38:26.200 --> 38:29.360
so the sun right now, it's full.

38:29.360 --> 38:32.720
It's doing everything it can

38:33.560 --> 38:34.400
while it can.

38:35.840 --> 38:40.680
Would you say it's around 96 degrees at this point in time?

38:40.680 --> 38:45.680
Yeah, but it feels like 98 and sweat is picking up.

38:46.200 --> 38:49.760
You are actively getting moist while doing this work.

38:49.760 --> 38:53.840
And I'm like whacking, I'm like, I'm going all out

38:53.840 --> 38:57.520
whacking with this curtain rod that is like so bent.

38:57.560 --> 39:02.520
Like little pieces of it are like falling off

39:02.520 --> 39:03.360
while I'm doing it.

39:03.360 --> 39:06.200
You guys look back, you see Stevie is crushing

39:06.200 --> 39:09.780
her second canned cold brew of the trip.

39:10.640 --> 39:15.640
And she brings over one energy drink to Mr. Wilder

39:16.640 --> 39:20.120
and brings another Coke over to Mr. Colorado.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.280
She somehow kept it cold.

39:21.280 --> 39:22.920
She's like, I brought a cooler.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.480
Stevie, you are...

39:24.800 --> 39:29.800
Thank you, oh, you said everything.

39:31.440 --> 39:34.720
A newsman without words, oh wow, what a compliment.

39:34.720 --> 39:35.680
Stevie, would you?

39:35.680 --> 39:36.800
Am I a wonder?

39:36.800 --> 39:41.500
Like an improv podcaster without words, it never happens.

39:42.760 --> 39:46.520
Julius, yeah, asks Stevie, would you mind?

39:46.520 --> 39:48.200
And hands her the curtain rod.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.260
Yeah, for sure.

39:49.260 --> 39:51.600
First of all, I mean, energy drink is funny

39:51.640 --> 39:55.120
but like when we get Coke as a sponsor,

39:55.120 --> 39:56.480
I'll be the one laughing.

39:57.320 --> 39:59.360
You guys are gonna wish you said monster.

40:01.360 --> 40:02.640
Call your shots.

40:02.640 --> 40:04.600
We can't, we wouldn't get Red Bull.

40:05.980 --> 40:08.120
So Stevie will take this crumpled.

40:09.160 --> 40:11.720
In my mind, it's mostly crumpled

40:11.720 --> 40:16.160
but there's like one foot of like solid curtain rod.

40:16.160 --> 40:19.240
Yeah, and she's gonna use that to just basically

40:19.240 --> 40:22.520
push up against the steel where you've left off

40:22.520 --> 40:26.240
and then drag it forcefully to the left

40:26.240 --> 40:28.420
is just kind of heading toward this arrow.

40:28.420 --> 40:31.880
You guys have made it probably eight feet of clearing

40:31.880 --> 40:35.080
by this point and it's taken like 15 minutes.

40:35.080 --> 40:38.040
Can I do like a search roll through this foliage

40:38.040 --> 40:40.680
to see if I can find more of an easy point of access?

40:40.680 --> 40:43.160
Yeah, absolutely, go ahead and roll.

40:43.160 --> 40:46.840
Wait, okay, yeah, I was afraid of that.

40:46.840 --> 40:49.560
That's a 66 on a 60, that's a critical failure.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.620
You went to the right.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.100
Well, I like, I trip into some of the foliage

40:58.100 --> 41:00.240
like trying to point out something

41:00.240 --> 41:04.400
and a bunch of our progress is eliminated, I think,

41:04.400 --> 41:06.560
like 15 more minutes of hacking

41:06.560 --> 41:09.040
because I brought down a bunch of vines and shit.

41:09.040 --> 41:10.760
And Cal, as you trip.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.480
I think I see something, fellas.

41:12.480 --> 41:15.880
You trip and knock over a bunch of vines

41:15.880 --> 41:17.640
which at first everyone thinks

41:17.640 --> 41:20.340
is going to cause a deep impediment

41:20.340 --> 41:25.340
but it actually reveals a thick metal hatch door.

41:26.380 --> 41:29.920
And as you begin to pick yourself up off the ground,

41:29.920 --> 41:34.920
you look down and see that you have fallen into poison oak.

41:35.360 --> 41:36.400
Oh.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.000
I was wondering, I was like,

41:38.000 --> 41:41.800
we can't go through the door, it came from a crisp hill.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.680
I was like, what the fuck?

41:43.680 --> 41:44.920
We're not gonna go that way.

41:44.960 --> 41:46.780
It seems like you really screwed up

41:46.780 --> 41:49.240
and that's the bad thing that happened.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.560
Cal, cover that up slowly.

41:51.560 --> 41:52.920
We never saw the hatch.

41:53.840 --> 41:56.340
Cal's like, no, my news hands.

41:58.580 --> 42:00.160
So until you get this cleared up,

42:00.160 --> 42:02.160
you're gonna be at a negative 20%

42:02.160 --> 42:04.600
because you're gonna be dealing with how itchy you are.

42:04.600 --> 42:05.440
To everything?

42:05.440 --> 42:06.360
Yeah. Okay.

42:06.360 --> 42:09.080
Stevie, Stevie, do you have any salve?

42:09.080 --> 42:10.040
Actually, you know what?

42:10.040 --> 42:11.880
It's gonna give you a plus,

42:11.880 --> 42:13.660
it's gonna take away 20 on everything

42:13.660 --> 42:16.140
but it's gonna give you a plus 20 on grip

42:16.140 --> 42:19.660
because you're way more focused on your own body

42:19.660 --> 42:20.900
than the world around you.

42:20.900 --> 42:23.000
That's really cool.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.100
I thought you meant grip.

42:24.100 --> 42:27.460
Like, I was like, Zach, think about that.

42:27.460 --> 42:28.780
Plus 20 to climb.

42:28.780 --> 42:31.380
That's because your hands are so sticky

42:31.380 --> 42:33.620
from them being just blisters.

42:33.620 --> 42:38.020
My Cal ooze lets me cling to walls.

42:38.020 --> 42:40.340
No, I actually really like that.

42:40.340 --> 42:43.380
Like physical pain keeps you distracted from-

42:43.980 --> 42:44.800
From your mental pain?

42:44.800 --> 42:45.640
Yeah.

42:45.640 --> 42:46.480
Flagellation, baby.

42:48.340 --> 42:51.300
So plus 20 grip, minus 20 everything else?

42:51.300 --> 42:52.120
Yep.

42:52.120 --> 42:55.020
Whoa, Cal, you did it, man.

42:55.020 --> 42:56.680
That's the door.

42:56.680 --> 42:58.820
I suppose I did.

42:58.820 --> 43:00.820
Let's see if there's a pin behind there.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.140
No, no, Cal.

43:04.140 --> 43:04.960
Yeah, all right.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.000
Yeah, let's see if there's a pin.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.460
I need you guys to stand back for a little bit.

43:10.460 --> 43:14.500
Obviously, we need you to record the whole thing

43:14.500 --> 43:16.500
and you're the face.

43:16.500 --> 43:18.540
And I try to open the hatch up.

43:22.700 --> 43:25.860
As you turn the wheel of this enormous metal hatch

43:27.980 --> 43:30.500
into open, unlocked position

43:30.500 --> 43:34.740
and with almost a free momentum

43:34.740 --> 43:36.580
without giving any weight push at all.

43:36.580 --> 43:40.340
As if it was like a hydraulic system to open up.

43:41.180 --> 43:44.260
This door just, I'm gonna do it again.

43:44.260 --> 43:47.060
Wait, is it going like this or like this?

43:47.060 --> 43:48.900
Like a normal door, like a normal door.

43:48.900 --> 43:49.740
I thought you said it was a hatch.

43:49.740 --> 43:52.140
Yeah, I was picturing it on the ground too.

43:52.140 --> 43:57.140
You said he fell onto, like a metal door.

43:57.180 --> 44:01.260
I only use the word hatch and I keep doing this to you guys.

44:01.260 --> 44:03.720
But when I say hatch, I just mean one of those

44:03.720 --> 44:07.120
like a thick metal doors like in a submarine.

44:07.120 --> 44:09.060
Yeah, like a SpongeBob door.

44:09.060 --> 44:10.740
But not necessarily round.

44:10.740 --> 44:11.580
Exactly.

44:11.580 --> 44:12.420
Gotcha.

44:12.420 --> 44:13.460
Yeah, this is magic.

44:13.460 --> 44:15.880
Okay, cool, I gotcha, perfectly.

44:17.260 --> 44:18.340
Like 007.

44:18.340 --> 44:20.580
A door that you open with a cool spinny thing.

44:20.580 --> 44:23.420
Yeah, the cool spinny thing does that noise.

44:23.420 --> 44:24.980
Those can be round, but this one is not.

44:24.980 --> 44:26.380
Just to make sure.

44:26.380 --> 44:29.420
This is vertical door leading into the structure

44:29.420 --> 44:32.620
that we were previously hacking at, right?

44:32.620 --> 44:36.020
Yep, and it's the one that the arrow was pointing at.

44:36.020 --> 44:36.860
That too.

44:36.860 --> 44:37.980
Cool.

44:37.980 --> 44:40.420
I go in if it opens.

44:40.420 --> 44:43.460
Beck wants to turn on the light of his camera.

44:43.460 --> 44:46.420
It is not dark on the other side.

44:46.420 --> 44:47.780
In fact, it's quite bright.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.420
And as the three of you walk through,

44:52.420 --> 44:54.940
Stevie right behind you on your tail,

44:54.940 --> 44:55.780
carrying all of your gear.

44:55.780 --> 44:57.100
Beck has a tail, by the way.

44:57.100 --> 44:59.460
Heh heh heh heh heh heh.

44:59.460 --> 45:01.460
Riding Beck's tail.

45:01.460 --> 45:02.540
Stan Stevie is three inches tall.

45:02.540 --> 45:04.540
Listening to Julius' tail.

45:04.540 --> 45:07.500
Heh heh heh heh heh heh.

45:07.940 --> 45:11.860
On the other side of this enormous and lush impediment

45:11.860 --> 45:16.460
is a vast opening with plenty to unpack.

45:16.460 --> 45:19.140
He said vast opening with plenty to unpack.

45:19.140 --> 45:23.780
First, you see an unnecessarily massive bridge,

45:23.780 --> 45:27.780
20 meters tall and 100 meters long.

45:27.780 --> 45:30.860
This bridge is a minimalist construction

45:30.860 --> 45:34.700
showcasing the steel that seems to be the only way

45:34.700 --> 45:39.700
over this deep, wide and foggy ravine.

45:40.940 --> 45:43.820
On your side of this bridge,

45:43.820 --> 45:48.380
a single simple steel train car is waiting

45:48.380 --> 45:53.100
in a simple steel single train car sized train station,

45:53.100 --> 45:58.100
presumably here to take you across this awe inducing chasm.

45:58.220 --> 46:01.660
On the outside of this minimalist depot,

46:01.660 --> 46:06.060
above a wall of lockers is a sign that says,

46:06.060 --> 46:09.300
Welcome to Grover's Gorge,

46:09.300 --> 46:14.220
founded by Frank Godel in 1945

46:14.220 --> 46:16.780
by necessity, not choice.

46:17.620 --> 46:20.620
My life is great

46:20.620 --> 46:24.780
And it's all my fault

46:24.780 --> 46:29.780
Cause my life is great

46:29.780 --> 46:31.780
And it's all mine

46:39.260 --> 46:44.140
Cause my life is great

46:44.140 --> 46:47.180
And it's all my fault
