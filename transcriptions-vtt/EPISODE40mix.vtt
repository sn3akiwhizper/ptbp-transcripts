00:00.000 --> 00:09.220
Listen here y'all, listen real close, closer, come on don't be scared, snuggle on up with

00:09.220 --> 00:15.340
your little wolfy boy, prepare to be comforted by the sounds of your favorite cuddle bug

00:15.340 --> 00:24.740
wolf the dog, broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP the radio station of your dreams baby.

00:24.740 --> 00:31.660
This week's howlin with wolf comes from atj51ropa on twitter who tagged at pretending pod in

00:31.660 --> 00:37.920
one of them their tweets, wow what a thoughtful act of support on a social media platform

00:37.920 --> 00:44.580
that wolf definitely knows how to use without help, thanks my baby, they write, hey wolf

00:44.580 --> 00:50.460
my dog, been missing your dulcet tones since I moved from contention to the city, it was

00:50.460 --> 00:56.020
a real pleasant surprise to hear your pirate station up and running, can you give a shout

00:56.020 --> 01:01.420
out to my lady still living in contention, I haven't heard from her in a couple days

01:01.420 --> 01:08.980
so I think she must be mad at me, why else won't she return my calls, Bethany Ann Laberbarra

01:08.980 --> 01:15.020
if you're listening, I love you, now that I think about it, no one from contention has

01:15.020 --> 01:23.660
returned my calls, huh from JR pronounced JR not Jr from twitter slash the city, well

01:23.660 --> 01:29.860
JR not Jr I once had me a little wolfy guy who would never return my calls, the only

01:29.860 --> 01:34.220
thing that got her attention was when I threw a brick covered in crawdad grease through

01:34.220 --> 01:39.420
her window in the dead of night, she finally started talking to me though it may have been

01:39.420 --> 01:45.420
to scream at me that she was calling the police, so Bethany Ann return JR not Jr's

01:45.420 --> 01:51.740
calls won't you, if you don't we'll have to assume something bad is going down in contention

01:51.740 --> 01:57.540
that would prevent true love from blossoming, speaking of bad shit going down that prevents

01:57.540 --> 02:04.440
any of us from finding true happiness, this is the news, last time our intrepid former

02:04.440 --> 02:10.620
police officers entered the glass family compound and took a strange elevator meeting a nice

02:10.620 --> 02:17.400
old lady and her spell performing friends on the way down to some kind of massive dank

02:17.400 --> 02:25.240
aquatic interrogation chamber, on metal catwalks above murky green water they found Francis

02:25.240 --> 02:32.680
beans interrogating Kathy Piston while lowering George Piston into the foul aquarium, unsurprisingly

02:32.680 --> 02:39.680
a bit of a tussle ensued, also unsurprisingly Keith Vigna found his way into the water,

02:39.680 --> 02:44.320
but as he was climbing up George Piston's body to escape from an unknown creature in

02:44.320 --> 02:50.680
the depths that very beast swallowed the two of them and dove back into the hideous and

02:50.680 --> 03:00.040
opaque pool below, oh no y'all that can't be good can it, oh well I have a note here

03:00.040 --> 03:05.480
from my producer, seems like back in episode 34 we claimed there would be some sort of

03:05.480 --> 03:11.840

06:31.120 --> 06:39.920
guy on a role-playing podcast don't call me a hero

06:39.920 --> 06:47.920
okay i'll keep that in my fine i'm a hero don't make me sing don't rub my face in it you know

06:48.880 --> 06:56.880
my heroic rugged face and you can see that heroic rugged face on our instagram at pretending pod

06:57.440 --> 07:01.600
woof let's dive into it while we on that jovial note yeah

07:05.120 --> 07:10.400
keith dived into it those murky black waters from which he'll never return

07:11.520 --> 07:19.440
clark bishop john lee pettimore and francis beans are standing on a recently made wet catwalk

07:19.440 --> 07:31.200
as the water begins to calm in front of them you guys see a couple bubbles rise to the top keith

07:31.200 --> 07:38.240
keith silence prisoner don't speak about your captors in such a familiar tone

07:40.480 --> 07:48.640
mr vigna that's that's better what is francis doing she is standing perfectly still staring

07:48.640 --> 07:55.280
at the water along with you guys and then she looks over at you i guess let's just fucking

07:55.280 --> 08:00.800
hang this guy up and we can torture him or you know interrogate him at like the same time yeah

08:00.800 --> 08:07.120
sure all right why don't you get that hook ready and i'll get him ready okay so she jumps and grabs

08:07.120 --> 08:14.320
on to the rope and swings across to the other side of the catwalk the chain yes sorry the chain

08:14.800 --> 08:22.000
she grabs on to this wet mossy covered chain and swings across to the other side and then walks

08:22.000 --> 08:28.080
toward you guys with the chain with the fish hook on the end of it and she begins walking toward

08:28.080 --> 08:35.920
you what do you do i walk around the other side away from her stop being so squirrely prisoner

08:36.720 --> 08:42.160
as she's approaching with the fish hook like she's stretching the chain out behind her right like

08:42.640 --> 08:48.480
hauling it i want to try to like sneak attack her and just shove the hook right into her face

08:50.800 --> 08:55.440
okay let's go ahead and i want to be like here let me let me see that pass it here and then i

08:55.440 --> 09:00.240
just want to shove it straight up through her brain all right let's do a melee contest go

09:00.240 --> 09:09.920
ahead and roll uh melee combat for me i have okay so we've got unarmed combat and melee weapons yes

09:10.000 --> 09:12.240
all right this would be a melee weapon yeah okay gotcha

09:14.160 --> 09:21.360
glad i didn't put any points in that yay ten yeah uh she rolled a 12.

09:22.400 --> 09:33.680
fuck yeah oh damn it so as you move to grab this and basically attack her with it she gets the

09:33.680 --> 09:41.440
jump on you and immediately turns it around and shoves it into your let's see what damage would

09:41.440 --> 09:49.760
this be let's call it a d8 i mean can i try to dodge no you failed the competition against her

09:49.760 --> 09:59.520
and she shoves it directly into your shoulder and the fish hook goes and you can feel it break into

09:59.520 --> 10:04.960
the metal underneath your skin and then push through the metal that is just on the other

10:04.960 --> 10:10.880
side of your skin as it goes into your shoulder what's that put your hit points at what did she

10:10.880 --> 10:18.560
roll six damage uh that puts me at 13. all righty and as she does that it is clark bishop's turn can

10:18.560 --> 10:23.760
i try and kick her and push her or shove her into the water that she's standing there absolutely

10:24.000 --> 10:25.520
hold on i'd like to persuade her again

10:27.600 --> 10:32.400
that'll be unarmed combat are we good no what are you doing what are you doing

10:32.400 --> 10:37.600
are you fucking with me right now no no you're not yet not yet

10:41.120 --> 10:44.080
so lick thought we called his name and so he came barging into the

10:45.360 --> 10:50.720
wow it was your scream i met uh when you get the hook yeah it was

10:51.040 --> 10:55.200
i didn't scream

10:58.640 --> 11:00.560
you just screamed the thing that hurt you

11:05.600 --> 11:09.920
it's a strange pronunciation but it got his attention i am unarmed combating

11:09.920 --> 11:13.040
her to push her into the water absolutely go ahead and roll it

11:13.200 --> 11:20.640
oh oh i did oh my god it's a crit success it's a 66 on a 70 okay i thought i could fail but i

11:20.640 --> 11:27.600
got a 70 in that unarmed all right so i gave luke a check for avoiding going into the water

11:27.600 --> 11:31.840
it was a dexterity check so i'm even though you crit succeeded i'm going to give her the same

11:31.840 --> 11:37.520
role but i'm going to give her a negative 40 to her dexterity which actually puts her dexterity

11:37.760 --> 11:42.160
which actually puts her dexterity at 30 so if she can roll

11:42.160 --> 11:46.080
why even roll why don't you a success on a 30 then she can avoid

11:48.240 --> 11:54.720
and i rolled a 44 thank fuck a crit fail fail so do you want to describe what happens as

11:54.720 --> 12:03.520
francis beans shoves this small girl shoves this big fish hook this big like rusty fish hook into

12:04.320 --> 12:09.600
more you come up and kick her off kick her center mass and just fling her into the water

12:09.600 --> 12:15.680
but for the failiness of it i want you to tell me what happens yeah no as as you as you kick her

12:15.680 --> 12:23.600
she is actually going to smack her head on the side of the catwalk as she falls in and her limp

12:23.600 --> 12:31.680
body immediately just like belly flops onto the water kathy piston starts hollering she's like oh

12:31.760 --> 12:42.400
fuck yeah baby that is what i like to see and the limp soon to be perhaps corpse of francis beans

12:42.400 --> 12:53.040
lies floating on top of the dark green murky water below we're gonna cut to luke oh what

12:53.520 --> 12:55.760
he's in a fish

13:00.080 --> 13:03.040
you mean i'd like to see him get out of this conundrum

13:04.160 --> 13:08.400
it's character creation that's all they're gonna do tonight it'd actually be amazing

13:09.360 --> 13:17.760
so

13:20.560 --> 13:27.120
yeah i think we decided that thomas either just yelled or mispronounced hook or yeah well i was

13:27.120 --> 13:32.960
all the way in the kitchen talking to taylor i just heard a loud yell with a k sound at the

13:33.040 --> 13:35.040
end so i was like oh i think they're calling me

13:37.840 --> 13:44.000
well i just miss you guys exactly that makes sense it's time for you now okay well i can't

13:44.000 --> 13:53.360
say that i'm excited about it but let's see where it goes it's extremely wet and dark and all you

13:53.360 --> 14:11.120
hear is as all of this viscous membrane and water is pouring in and you also hear the cries

14:11.120 --> 14:19.440
of george piston who is inside this creature with you first off i need you to roll sanity

14:19.520 --> 14:30.480
16 on a nine you're gonna lose one sanity that puts me at my breaking point oh okay well then

14:30.480 --> 14:37.680
let's get you a mania from the call of cthulhu seventh edition rule book okay i'll roll three

14:37.680 --> 14:43.040
times three times on a d100 uh 67 all righty

14:45.920 --> 14:47.360
21 all right

14:50.000 --> 15:03.280
and 84 84 67 21 84 all righty 67 is mellow mania which is an obsession with music or a specific

15:03.280 --> 15:26.400
tune okay 21 is kaka demon mania is a pathological belief that one is inhabited by an evil spirit

15:26.400 --> 15:33.120
okay i like that one what's the last one 84 is 84 is plutomania which is the obsessive

15:33.280 --> 15:39.040
desire for wealth i'm gonna go ahead and say the second one where i think what is it i'm possessed

15:39.040 --> 15:49.840
by a demon cacodemomania cacodemomania yeah c-a-c-o-d-e-m-o mania okay and so you pronounce it

15:49.840 --> 15:56.960
just as well as i could cacodemomania cacodemomania is a pathological belief that one is inhabited

15:56.960 --> 16:05.360
by an evil spirit so now keith vigna oh i like this you have both had the empathy taken from

16:05.360 --> 16:11.600
you correct and you also believe yourself to be inhabited by an evil spirit it's a very fun

16:11.600 --> 16:18.880
combination that is good and you are inside of a giant creature with george piston who cries out

16:18.880 --> 16:26.640
in the darkness you got my you got my leg you got you got my leg who is that who's who is am i

16:26.720 --> 16:30.800
grabbing onto his leg i believe you were still holding on to it from when you were holding on

16:30.800 --> 16:39.680
trying to climb up him i say nothing and i try to claw my way up george piston put my foot on his

16:39.680 --> 16:46.720
head and reach and try to get as close up to the mouth of this creature as i can absolutely so what

16:46.720 --> 16:55.040
i'm gonna need you to do as you are pushing your back against this disgusting membrane you actually

16:55.040 --> 17:04.800
feel the mucus and the the viscous sludge that is the inside of this creature perhaps burning what

17:04.800 --> 17:11.520
is that feeling it's it's not quite burning it's it smells terrible in here and you feel pain and

17:11.520 --> 17:19.520
you had no senses yeah so i'm gonna need you to roll constitution if i don't roll over this would

17:19.520 --> 17:27.840
be real mad what do you have in constitution god damn it 70 i rolled at 89 all righty you are going

17:27.840 --> 17:37.360
to take two damage okay not bad and you continue climbing up george piston starts screaming out and

17:37.360 --> 17:43.600
he's just like no no it fucking burns i punch him in the face to shut him up it's completely

17:43.600 --> 17:51.040
dark in here so go ahead and roll at a negative 40 you're unarmed i can't i can't roll that then

17:51.040 --> 17:57.520
okay so you don't do that you're swinging wildly at what you think might be george piston your fists

17:57.520 --> 18:04.880
are only getting more inside fish man creature okay uh i just continue crawling up as you begin

18:04.880 --> 18:14.640
climbing up this massive disgusting creature is going to attempt to swallow harder in order to

18:14.640 --> 18:25.040
digest you sooner okay as it moves and contracts its muscles it rolls a 19 and you begin moving

18:25.040 --> 18:32.880
down from where you were and it is clear that the muscle muscly walls on either side of you are

18:32.880 --> 18:40.960
pushing you further into this fish creature and you are exactly where you were last round go

18:40.960 --> 18:49.760
ahead and roll a constitution check as more juices flow over your skin the face the face that luke

18:49.760 --> 18:58.800
just made i roll a 90 well that sucks okay i'm getting even more new dice let's go ahead and

18:58.800 --> 19:06.240
roll some damage here god damn it six i have been rolling like bullshit tonight six yeah you're

19:06.240 --> 19:12.960
gonna take six more damage as these juices like literally start burning that puts me down to 17

19:12.960 --> 19:21.200
and instead of crawling up i take out my very small very powerful pistol and fire off as many

19:21.200 --> 19:27.200
shots as i can around you know like a not in the same spot but around the same spot to try to

19:28.000 --> 19:32.240
put a hole in this creature all right go ahead and roll 2d 10 for damage for me

19:33.520 --> 19:42.400
12 12 you begin shooting and you can feel the writhing and discomfort within this creature

19:42.400 --> 19:49.360
that you are within as it begins to freak out and it's swimming all or like the movement is

19:49.360 --> 19:56.880
uncanny compared to how smooth everything was before i mean your gun fires and you can feel

19:56.880 --> 20:03.600
the pressure that you've blown into the inside of this fish but there's no water gushing in from the

20:03.600 --> 20:13.280
side or anything yet and it decides to continue its plan of swallowing you further so it is going

20:13.280 --> 20:22.480
to roll again am i doing con again or and then i need you to roll con thank you that is a 44

20:22.480 --> 20:30.000
on a 70 oh all right you are still gonna take damage just a lower dice but with a crit success

20:30.560 --> 20:36.640
you will take no damage from this mucus yeah and you are still in the same spot you're in

20:36.640 --> 20:45.760
what i want to do is i want to pull out a frag grenade stick it in the hole that i've made with

20:45.760 --> 20:55.120
my gun and then i want to push george up against that hole oh my god to protect myself oh that is

20:55.120 --> 21:06.000
rough fish holy shit okay i'm gonna have you roll an athletics check in order to move george piston

21:06.000 --> 21:21.120
into position it's 45 on a 50 45 on a 50 as hell yeah you do exactly what you described you pull

21:21.120 --> 21:26.080
out a frag grenade you knew exactly where they were on your belt or inside i'm sorry inside your

21:26.080 --> 21:33.200
massive in my in my trunks at this point these are doubling as swimming trunks and i've never seen

21:33.200 --> 21:38.080
cargo shorts used as swimming trunks that's a lie i live in southwest missouri i've definitely

21:38.080 --> 21:48.640
seen just technically swimming trunks now and you shove this frag grenade up into the hole that

21:48.640 --> 21:55.040
you've made with your small but powerful gun and then you grab the underneath the arms of george

21:55.040 --> 22:01.760
piston and move him directly over the position which he would usually i think he would win the

22:01.760 --> 22:09.600
medal of honor for jesus christ had he not been put there by me taking one for the team uh

22:12.320 --> 22:19.520
do you think that part of your action of doing this is caused by your new belief that there's

22:19.520 --> 22:25.120
an evil spirit inside of you absolutely and then are you just giving yourself a pass because well

22:25.120 --> 22:30.800
it's there's an evil spirit inside of me and i literally part of my brain that has empathy is

22:30.800 --> 22:38.400
missing oh yep i said it earlier and i already forgot the uh combination of the two i am i'm

22:38.400 --> 22:43.520
better than everybody i know and i don't give a fuck if you die for me to live all right well

22:43.520 --> 22:49.760
let's go ahead and i'm gonna roll some damage here actually i'll have you roll the damage okay what

22:49.760 --> 22:55.440
do you want me to roll i'm sure that there is a specific amount of damage taken from a frag

22:55.440 --> 23:01.520
grenade but i'm gonna say that you're gonna roll 46 because you are putting him literally right

23:01.520 --> 23:10.640
up against it that's six eleven eleven so you're gonna have that and you're gonna take half that

23:10.640 --> 23:19.280
damage rounding up so you take six more damage okay however you have successfully blown a hole

23:19.280 --> 23:27.440
in the side of this creature you immediately feel cold water rushing in whereas before you

23:27.440 --> 23:35.680
were just surrounded by warm wet mucus and guts but now there's this cold murky water coming in

23:35.680 --> 23:42.400
and you can kind of feel an opening that you can grip you know what i'm talking about yeah i want

23:42.480 --> 23:50.320
to ace ventura out of this fish can you describe that in physical detail for me i've never seen

23:50.320 --> 23:59.440
ace ventura the grenade explodes shrapnel pretty much blows george in half so that's the reason why

23:59.440 --> 24:05.440
water's rushing in instead of him being stuck up next to it is his body's blown in half he may

24:05.440 --> 24:12.240
still be alive for a minute but probably not i miss leo i stick my head with my hands

24:12.240 --> 24:19.840
right up against my like forehead uh-huh and i start ripping this fish open and i'm just

24:19.840 --> 24:27.520
wiggling my face out to where it's barely out and then i with all my strength push myself out

24:28.800 --> 24:34.240
into the water out of this is this did did it's always sunny do the exact same joke as ace

24:34.240 --> 24:40.560
ventura it was ace ventura putting his face out of a fake rhinos butthole oh okay i'll show it

24:40.560 --> 24:46.240
to you after this i think frank uh danny divido comes out of a couch yeah very similar all right

24:46.240 --> 24:52.480
well you are birthed out of this massive creature i pull a jonah except i think jonah was less

24:52.480 --> 24:59.280
violent i i don't know ninova was a pretty dirty place all right let's uh let's get the rest of

24:59.280 --> 25:14.400
the place into the room for this next part clark bishop john lee pettymore the two of you are

25:14.400 --> 25:22.320
standing on this wet catwalk looking down at the body of francis beans underneath the surface of

25:22.320 --> 25:30.080
the water deep down somewhere below you feel this massive quake and there's a rumbling of the entire

25:30.080 --> 25:36.800
catwalk and it shakes you violently back and forth you hold your footing but you see this

25:36.800 --> 25:44.880
burst of light from inside the murky water below and then you start to see bubbles coming up

25:45.600 --> 25:53.440
onto the surface of this disgusting water and looking at the body of francis beans

25:54.320 --> 26:01.040
you see right next to her the water break and popping up to the surface is keith vigna

26:04.000 --> 26:12.640
keith keith fuck i'm just flapping around like trying to stay above water catching my breath

26:13.280 --> 26:20.720
guys get me the fuck out of this water oh my god oh keith vigna is george is george alive

26:21.440 --> 26:27.760
kathy screams from her spot hanging from these chains get me out of here and i'll let you know

26:27.760 --> 26:34.000
what happened i go reaching down to try and grab keith with nothing really keeping you from doing

26:34.000 --> 26:40.160
so you're able to grab onto him and we grab each other and you pull me up out of the mucky slippery

26:40.160 --> 26:49.120
water i grab the edge and i hoist myself up you see that keith's skin is red and burned and kind

26:49.120 --> 26:56.720
of peeling a little bit am i able to first aid myself or does that need to happen by someone

26:56.720 --> 27:01.600
else you certainly don't have the materials that's to do that right now someone's gonna have to look

27:01.600 --> 27:10.400
you down pee on him i i get up i fall over the i fall over the railing i immediately start peeing

27:10.400 --> 27:17.520
with a penis that works i i get up i fall over the railing and i am just laying sprawled out on my

27:17.520 --> 27:23.440
back on the catwalk trying to catch my breath what the what the fuck keith where is he where's my

27:23.440 --> 27:30.960
george he didn't make it what do you what do you mean he didn't make it you made it was he not right

27:31.840 --> 27:37.360
he helped me get out in a way get out and then i kind of laughed

27:40.320 --> 27:43.680
in a way he helped me get out well what do you mean he helps you get out

27:44.880 --> 27:54.640
he uh he uh sacrificed himself in it for me if you will you heartless bastard what the fuck happened

27:54.720 --> 28:01.600
down there i just look up at the above me and just keep catching my breath keith are you

28:01.600 --> 28:07.600
teeth what yeah what happened are you with us what i saw you i saw you get eaten but i felt

28:07.600 --> 28:16.640
myself get eaten i was halfway digested by a fucking fish i had to shoot my way out i

28:16.640 --> 28:22.080
look at kathy and i'm like you know what i don't care you gotta know i shot my way out

28:23.040 --> 28:27.360
couldn't didn't really work so i stuck a grenade in the hole that i made

28:29.280 --> 28:33.120
i put george right up against that hole to shield

28:35.120 --> 28:43.120
and i blew my way out of that fish oh no you did what keith you're the worst cop i don't know

28:43.120 --> 28:49.680
if he had i hope he had a quick death but he was screaming as i as i squirmed my way out

28:50.560 --> 28:53.840
she doesn't need to know that why did you think she should know that

28:53.840 --> 29:00.000
there's something in me she's just crying there's something in me uh i want to i want to

29:01.600 --> 29:06.320
okay i hit him i hit him with the bottom of my gun in the head oh my god do you let that

29:06.320 --> 29:12.960
happen keith no i'm gonna roll against that yeah all right melee against dodge what are you doing

29:12.960 --> 29:19.280
he's coming at you with the butt of his gun uh look at me what do you do athletics no no not

29:19.280 --> 29:22.720
what role you do what do you do to get out of the way of his gun he's coming at you with the

29:22.720 --> 29:28.880
butt of his gun i roll over you roll over yeah so that's a dodge so okay you're gonna roll against

29:28.880 --> 29:38.720
his melee weapons i have a 56 on a 30 i also failed 64 on a 40 john lee petty more 30 you

29:38.720 --> 29:45.920
kind of like sideswipe his face but he's like literally covered in this disgusting mucusy

29:45.920 --> 29:51.920
goo that hasn't quite rinsed off completely and the butt of your gun just kind of slides right

29:51.920 --> 29:56.000
off the side of his head okay so i turn it around and i point it at his face and i say what the fuck

29:56.000 --> 30:04.320
do you mean there's something in you something i saw something in there i don't know if i'm

30:04.320 --> 30:11.840
gonna try to control it but there's something evil inside me can i look into keith's eyes

30:12.560 --> 30:17.200
do i see any difference is there a little man in there i see a little boy

30:18.960 --> 30:24.000
evil man strapping luke what does he see in your eyes they look past you when you look into him

30:24.880 --> 30:31.600
i look over keith's head at kevin john and um i do just kind of like a look

30:31.600 --> 30:34.880
oh you pull your collar

30:37.920 --> 30:46.000
while they do that i i slide myself up into a standing position left and i look down at

30:46.000 --> 30:51.920
francis and i'm like well looks like you guys got her taken care of should we head on well i mean

30:52.960 --> 30:58.800
she's sort of taken care of i don't know if she she's maybe not she's just knocked out down there

30:59.040 --> 31:04.960
she'll be she will be taken care of floating face down well i she's currently just floating down

31:04.960 --> 31:09.360
so she's she probably died a couple minutes ago i'm saying if we want to fish her out and talk

31:09.360 --> 31:15.120
to her that would be the time well how long since she's been in the water like a minute yeah now

31:15.120 --> 31:21.600
would be the time for sure if it's not too late but we can try to do we want do we want to do we

31:21.600 --> 31:28.880
want to keith you have experience in this water get her out i look at i look i'm like we can try

31:28.880 --> 31:33.360
to hook her out of there but oh she deserves that and i i like patting my shoulder is it which you

31:33.360 --> 31:38.080
notice is all fucked up from huh is it out of you i've just realized i don't know if we know there's

31:38.080 --> 31:44.240
a when you patted your shoulder there's still a giant rusty fish hook inside of it you may have

31:44.240 --> 31:48.800
noticed this giant rusty fish yeah you just you just have a lot of slack so you're able to keep

31:48.800 --> 31:55.120
doing stuff i think we if i think at this point if we want to i don't know if we can talk to her

31:55.120 --> 31:59.440
but she might have something on her we want to get out but otherwise i think we just continue on and

31:59.440 --> 32:04.080
it's your niece keith i mean well my niece put me in this position i wouldn't have died if it

32:04.080 --> 32:09.760
hadn't been for her so i could give a fuck about her is that well she offered me the terrible

32:09.760 --> 32:15.280
decision that i had made that you made yeah of course she presented you with the choice that you

32:15.280 --> 32:22.720
chose it's all her fault it is had it not been for her i wouldn't be in the position i am i

32:22.720 --> 32:28.880
i didn't never died i don't think that's one way to look at it certainly i'm either way on this we

32:28.880 --> 32:34.480
can keep going or if you want to fish her out she might have something on her but a minute face down

32:34.480 --> 32:39.360
and water doesn't sound too promising yeah maybe we should go through her pockets that bitch

32:39.360 --> 32:47.600
deserves anything that you fucking deem necessary now will you fucking let me down please well wait

32:47.600 --> 32:52.960
hold up hold on a minute i need to ask you something what what are you i'm john lee

32:52.960 --> 32:58.640
pettymore don't you recognize me and i shoot her a wink her eyes go wide and she's like no

32:58.640 --> 33:03.440
you're definitely not bubble gum tree and i thought you don't know what that means so

33:03.440 --> 33:10.240
i walk up behind kevin john and i look at kathy kathy's uh he's telling you the truth

33:10.240 --> 33:16.160
that's that's john i've kind of snapped out of it real quick and i look over and i'm like i know

33:16.160 --> 33:21.360
you don't want to talk to me after what i said but i can attest to it as well yeah we're we're

33:21.360 --> 33:28.160
better people for you generally then than she were but i don't actually want to get you off

33:28.160 --> 33:34.800
them chains until you ask that last question she had what did the circle of knowledge use

33:34.800 --> 33:42.320
them homeless people for her face wrinkles up and she's like no way no way that all you all are all

33:42.320 --> 33:47.760
connected in all sorts of this terrible nonsense we're trying to we're trying to peel back the

33:47.760 --> 33:55.600
terrible nonsense you saw we're not on francis's side i walk past kevin toward kathy and i turn and

33:55.600 --> 34:03.280
look back at kevin i uh i actually know what they were using the people for and i look at kathy

34:03.280 --> 34:10.080
i said kathy i i'm working with maggie now how does she react she just lost her husband

34:10.720 --> 34:19.440
and she is hanging grotesquely from mid forearms she is in just an insane amount of pain and

34:19.440 --> 34:31.120
emotional torment so that while coming to her as a surprise does not necessarily garner a massive

34:31.120 --> 34:39.840
reaction okay so i guess everyone in this whole fucking world is under some weird sort of unnatural

34:39.840 --> 34:45.440
bullshit but if you if you if you're working for her then you fucking tell them well i'm telling

34:45.440 --> 34:50.720
you but we're we're on your side now yeah we're trying to stop that weird supernatural bullshit

34:51.600 --> 34:56.560
is that what you want well then fucking let me down this hurts i go ahead and do that i go ahead

34:56.560 --> 35:00.640
and try and help her down i don't know how to do that can i do joe doesn't know how to do that

35:00.640 --> 35:05.600
because i'm not standing there but would i be able to pull her in some way do you have uh any sort of

35:05.600 --> 35:11.040
like mechanical engineering or she's a little bit too far away from me you'd have to like jump out

35:11.040 --> 35:18.000
to her i mean looking over there is a lever that you saw francis using to lower george piston in

35:18.000 --> 35:23.120
i look over at her and i tell her start swinging our way we'll grab you i've got a really high

35:23.120 --> 35:28.320
survival skill would that help me in some way i don't think that's necessarily what that is meant

35:28.320 --> 35:34.640
for but whoever has the highest intelligence could roll intelligence to to figure this one out i'd say

35:34.640 --> 35:46.320
that's not me it's me oh no i have a 75 i crit failed 77 okay you are absolutely positive that

35:46.320 --> 35:52.080
you know what you're doing kathy i think you live there now i've got this no i've got this i can get

35:52.080 --> 35:58.880
it out definitely without severing any major arteries or hurting you in any way as we get you

35:58.880 --> 36:07.280
off this chain assembly and you go over and do what you will to the mechanism that is holding

36:07.280 --> 36:13.760
her up and as soon as you start fiddling with it she drops fully into the water the chain releases

36:13.760 --> 36:19.920
and it moves all the way down and it continues to lower and lower and lower and now the top of the

36:19.920 --> 36:26.480
chain or the bottom that you can see of the chain right up against the water is dry and has no algae

36:26.480 --> 36:33.200
or rust on it so you know that this is in fully engaged all the way down position oh well okay

36:33.200 --> 36:38.640
easy enough i do the opposite of what i just did and reverse that with that crit fail you lock it

36:38.640 --> 36:47.920
into position oh damn it i'm sorry kathy can i go over and like kick the lever kathy piston is

36:47.920 --> 36:52.240
drowning currently i want to try and kick it back the other direction but i don't know if you'll

36:52.240 --> 36:57.520
allow that with a crit failure no i certainly won't okay no so you can kick it yeah yeah

36:57.520 --> 37:02.400
you can set you can definitely kick it it breaks off it breaks off completely yeah there you go

37:02.400 --> 37:10.000
and uh and there is no lever anymore god damn it i start fiddling with the other lever trying to

37:10.000 --> 37:15.600
swing the hook into uh francis to try to pull her up and see if we can't search her george

37:15.600 --> 37:20.960
pistons hook yeah you're trying to hook francis beans with george pistons hook is it's it's not

37:20.960 --> 37:25.360
is it still stuck in the fish no no it was hanging yeah it's hanging yeah is she on that

37:25.360 --> 37:29.440
side thomas what do you got i'm gonna dive into the water and try to save kathy piston there you

37:29.440 --> 37:36.720
go so keith goes over and is fiddling with the other lever and john lee pettymore is diving in

37:37.520 --> 37:44.560
john oh shit that was stupid well keithy you blew you blew up the fish thing right i mean he's he's

37:44.560 --> 37:50.320
gonna be okay right there's no fish thing right i don't know how many is in here this is a look

37:50.320 --> 37:56.640
how big this tank is oh fuck jaw get out of there i'm swimming straight down all right on the chain

37:57.200 --> 38:01.360
uh luke and joe i'm gonna need you guys to leave the room oh shit

38:12.080 --> 38:19.200
john lee pettymore you dive into this dark green murky water and it is pretty cold

38:19.200 --> 38:25.680
on your skin as you begin swimming down directly following the chain yeah

38:26.880 --> 38:33.040
so this is an interesting that's what the chain wants me to do you never break the chain so when

38:33.040 --> 38:40.880
you are going down there i'm imagining that your mind is just filling up with all of these thoughts

38:40.880 --> 38:47.120
about what was just said above the water how many of these creatures actually exist

38:47.600 --> 38:57.840
in this aquarium power is a stat in this game that is for mental fortitude what is your power

38:58.720 --> 39:06.720
60 i'm gonna have you roll a power check and if you succeed you can continue without taking

39:06.720 --> 39:08.240
a sanity check okay

39:10.800 --> 39:20.960
30 you push all of those thoughts those intrusive thoughts out of your mind as you begin to go hand

39:20.960 --> 39:29.920
over hand down this chain into the darkness of this water go ahead and roll an athletics check

39:29.920 --> 39:43.120
for me 93 on a 50 93 on a 50 as you go hand over hand you you keep slipping on all this algae that

39:43.120 --> 39:49.120
is all over this chain but you continue making your way down and you think you hear something

39:50.320 --> 39:55.680
your ears are completely filled up with water but something i think i hear something it's perfect

39:55.680 --> 40:03.040
god you're right here with me inside of your mind and as you're going down i need you to roll

40:03.040 --> 40:13.920
luck for me oh no what's your luck at my luck is at 20. oh six holy shit

40:17.840 --> 40:23.280
fuck yes all right so i was giving you one athletics check to get down there

40:24.160 --> 40:31.840
okay yeah so you can now make your way all the way down to where kathy is get the hook

40:31.840 --> 40:38.080
out of her arms and follow the chain back up to the surface don't say i never did anything for

40:38.080 --> 40:44.400
you kathy all right i'm gonna get the other boys okay

40:53.280 --> 40:58.240
clark bishop you're looking down into the dark water where john lee pettymore just dove in

40:59.120 --> 41:06.160
keith you're messing with this hook over over there go ahead and roll a dexterity check for

41:06.160 --> 41:16.480
me to see if you can uh wrap or yeah dexterity for me yes sir 15 on a 60 nice much like a

41:16.480 --> 41:24.480
nice much like a well-versed child in an arcade you know exactly how to hook onto the body of

41:24.480 --> 41:31.280
francis beans and you can drag her over to where you can and then i dump it onto the catwalk the

41:31.280 --> 41:38.960
body the body the body the body you dump the body onto the the catwalk and do you do anything or you

41:38.960 --> 41:44.720
just look at it oh uh well i want to go search uh her like pockets and stuff to see if she has like

41:45.520 --> 41:51.440
keys or any anything that we can use to continue our path into the glass compound while he's

41:51.440 --> 41:57.360
searching can i see if i get a pulse yeah absolutely roll first aid for me clark as he's

41:57.360 --> 42:05.200
doing that keith you're going through the pockets and really all you find is a uh a stun gun and a

42:05.200 --> 42:12.240
card that is a dirty dog grooming key fob okay i failed my first aid roll a 68 on a 30 yeah she's

42:12.240 --> 42:20.480
she's alive and well uh i will take the oh she's alive what that was my fail was that i found i

42:20.480 --> 42:25.600
can tell that she's alive yeah you feel a pulse oh well i'll take the stun gun and does the card

42:25.600 --> 42:32.160
have her name on it or is it just a yes yeah it's for it's a key fob for uh the loyalty program

42:32.160 --> 42:39.200
at dirty dog grooming to francis beans well i'll pocket that and then uh i'll take the taser

42:39.200 --> 42:43.120
is there any way to check and see if that works is there like a light that lights up or anything on

42:43.120 --> 42:48.800
it sure yeah the light lights up it does the crackly noise yeah when you click on yeah it's

42:48.800 --> 42:55.680
got two little uh metal tips at the end and a little uh static goes in between the two points

42:55.680 --> 43:03.600
i'll stick that into my pockets and then uh is she alive yeah i got a pulse oh shit do you know cpr

43:03.600 --> 43:09.360
i do uh first aid on her to to do cpr okay roll that first aid clark would probably know how to

43:09.360 --> 43:17.360
do cpr too but i got a pretty high it's a nine on a 60 yeah keith vigna actually passed that exam

43:17.360 --> 43:25.440
more recently than you did yeah so keith as you begin doing cpr you realize that you have broken

43:25.440 --> 43:32.080
the sternum of the corpse of your niece francis beans because she wasn't actually alive no not

43:32.080 --> 43:39.920
even remotely keep going keith keep going you're you're doing good i swear i got a pulse i uh i

43:39.920 --> 43:44.560
kick her body back into the the water whoa whoa oh i do it i did it

43:47.440 --> 43:55.840
and i as as you do that um breaking the water john lee pettymore as you rise up you get hit

43:55.840 --> 44:07.040
in the head i kicked her into the other side he did not dive in now he's got total corpse

44:11.920 --> 44:18.480
and you guys help john lee pettymore holding cathy piston get onto the catwalk that you

44:18.480 --> 44:23.200
guys have all been on for some time now but he's gag reflexing all over keith yeah well

44:26.400 --> 44:33.040
they climb onto francis's floating dead body to uh hoist themselves up so that we can grab them

44:34.960 --> 44:40.560
and then he throws up all over me you got her you got her him and i all it took was a little

44:40.560 --> 44:50.320
bit of luck and i turned and winked to the camera uh is cathy looking alive and is she conscious

44:50.320 --> 44:54.400
nope she is unconscious i know cpr

44:58.560 --> 45:03.280
i just rolled to do it yeah you're in a pretty good mental state and you just succeeded

45:03.280 --> 45:10.480
so let's have that roll roll on over to cathy piston so i do a very good nine out of whatever

45:10.560 --> 45:18.640
i said 60 staying alive staying alive and i think it's staying alive

45:22.320 --> 45:23.360
yeah clark knows first

45:29.440 --> 45:35.440
nice and so cathy piston becomes spitting up this dirty water right into my mouth

45:35.440 --> 45:41.360
right into keith's mouth that's usually what happens when you're rinsing away some of the

45:41.920 --> 45:49.360
vomit that john lee pettymore just put there and she starts screaming she's like you you you

45:52.800 --> 45:57.840
killed me you saved me thank you well we was only trying to save you but we accidentally

45:58.480 --> 46:05.360
dropped you in that water i'm gonna need a second to recover one mississippi all right let's go

46:05.440 --> 46:12.320
so keith why didn't why didn't you just do that with francis too because i think that you might

46:12.320 --> 46:19.920
have uh felt your own pulse on her neck instead of hers i don't think that she was actually alive

46:19.920 --> 46:24.960
when we fished her out of there i'm sorry oh i'm not actually sorry though she's a bitch so clark

46:24.960 --> 46:29.760
grabbed her wrist with one hand and touched his neck with his other hand no no no he just felt

46:30.880 --> 46:34.560
the heat of the moment man he's like you know what he didn't do it correctly and he felt the

46:34.560 --> 46:44.160
pulse of his own finger and not her pulse which is uh no i i did the neck thing which you can still

46:44.160 --> 46:49.760
feel your own finger pulse on so i think you might have just fucked it up but uh yeah i uh

46:49.760 --> 46:54.640
tried to resuscitate a dead woman i tried my best though but then you resuscitated a live woman yeah

46:54.640 --> 47:01.360
and it worked so made up for it so clark you might once we once we're done with this you might need

47:01.360 --> 47:06.560
to take another first aid class but i think that's the least of our concerns today on that cpr that's

47:06.560 --> 47:12.880
for sure i'm glad you're here though and i look at everybody i'm like i think i'm ready to uh

47:12.880 --> 47:18.720
go see what's down there i want to go fuck marvin up yeah i think we should go and get us one more

47:18.720 --> 47:26.560
recruit before we go though who do we got uh our boy back there man i i pissed him off around but

47:26.560 --> 47:31.280
yeah but joe gave him a wink so also we can just leave you here and if we show up with kathy if

47:31.280 --> 47:40.320
it's me and joe and kathy walking down there i mean i say hey who's joe i'm sorry the water really

47:40.320 --> 47:47.280
addled my brains i was under for quite a while if me and uh clark and kathy walk on down there

47:47.280 --> 47:53.200
and he sees that you know i'm i'm with the two alleged prisoners maybe you just hang back a

47:53.200 --> 47:58.160
little you can i'll walk down a little bit with you but i'll hold back so i'll be i'll be close

47:58.160 --> 48:03.840
enough that i can help it's crouched down i'll be outside of his view yeah crawl up well because

48:03.840 --> 48:08.240
he's probably looking one way i'll just be right behind him where he can't see me that's such a

48:08.240 --> 48:12.960
good idea that everybody should just do that and as you do that behind the person they're trying

48:12.960 --> 48:21.360
not to be seen by it's very stealthy it's the only way clark looks down at kathy kathy are you uh

48:23.120 --> 48:27.760
are you with us well i'm certainly not against you you want to you want to help us

48:27.840 --> 48:33.680
in this little mission of ours what's the mission i i just take down water and glass and save the

48:33.680 --> 48:40.480
world and i put on some sunglasses that just came out of my pocket she looks up and she's like if

48:40.480 --> 48:48.960
you tell me where leo is then i will absolutely join you leo my brother-in-law he went missing

48:49.920 --> 48:54.960
he didn't well we don't know where'd all the missing people go well we're trying we're trying

48:55.200 --> 49:01.200
if you really are john lee pettymore and you two are fucking who you are then you know that

49:01.200 --> 49:07.440
everyone in contention's been gone missing and where are they well you think we took them we're

49:07.440 --> 49:16.160
trying to figure out the same as you but listen uh leo we saw leo disappear he was disappear

49:16.160 --> 49:22.880
just apparate this uh you know uh he left this plane of existence but he was all already dead

49:22.880 --> 49:28.240
but whose fault it is and we know this for fact it's marvin it's marvin glasses

49:28.240 --> 49:34.560
fault this on the world who is mar who's you're in marvin glasses lair yeah right now

49:34.560 --> 49:39.760
she knows who marvin glasses i fucked up oh okay well just do it listen to get it together yeah

49:39.760 --> 49:46.800
kid fucking kathy you're a mess i forgot i forgot he's is a business partner technically so

49:47.760 --> 49:54.400
i just forgot about one of my biggest clients back to that he's a business partner well yeah

49:54.400 --> 50:00.320
i supply him with you know people yeah let's talk about that how you use a people supplier well we

50:00.320 --> 50:05.600
don't really need to hop on into all that as soon as i lose my husband and have my whole world turned

50:05.600 --> 50:12.320
upside down john we just need you to help us out right now should i have saved your life or is you

50:12.400 --> 50:18.080
just a miserable sack of human trading shit look those people were compensated very fairly they

50:18.080 --> 50:23.520
got a place to stay and they got you know they got food to eat and what'd you do to them no in

50:23.520 --> 50:29.760
return i just borrowed them you know out to different people right so like you know i guess

50:29.760 --> 50:34.240
clark you know maggie they're at the circle of knowledge she's been using them and i know how

50:34.240 --> 50:38.160
mag has been using them do you know how marvin's been using them i didn't know marvin was using

50:38.160 --> 50:43.280
well yeah marvin you know he's a little bit darker you know than uh than jim was for sure

50:43.280 --> 50:48.960
but you know he certainly i don't know you know he he uses them for fights which isn't great you

50:48.960 --> 50:53.360
know obviously but we he normally breeds them first and then you know they're not born into

50:53.360 --> 51:00.160
a world where they're really known to any sort of comfort so i guess it makes it slightly better but

51:00.160 --> 51:05.920
mostly i'm just getting that sweet sweet money and i you know i've been using all those people

51:05.920 --> 51:11.440
down there uh you know uh getting getting my clicks from my business you are an awful sack

51:11.440 --> 51:18.240
of human shit and everything wrong with capitalism in this world but uh what do you mean using them

51:18.240 --> 51:23.520
different than jim jim cook yeah jim cook yeah he used to run he used to run the circle of knowledge

51:23.520 --> 51:28.880
obviously and but what yeah but why did you compare him to marvin well just because i've

51:28.880 --> 51:33.520
been working with jim for years and i've been working with marvin for years and uh you know

51:33.520 --> 51:38.400
i always felt fine handing people over to they'd always come back and they'd you know keep staying

51:38.400 --> 51:43.200
with me for a while but i was confused i thought marvin had inherited some kind of thing from jim

51:43.200 --> 51:49.520
but i was i was simply confused that was the way i said it was confusing i well i do this does

51:49.520 --> 51:57.440
bring me back to another point uh before i i dived into that water don't call me a hero but

51:57.440 --> 52:07.840
but but clark what the hell what what is the circle of knowledge using these homeless folk

52:07.840 --> 52:14.720
folk yeah about that um human experimentation no you know remember that thing i told you i

52:14.720 --> 52:20.400
saw in that vision that big thing that scared the day of living daylights out of me well to

52:20.400 --> 52:28.880
keep it contained wherever the plan of existence it's in they need people in that plan at all times

52:28.880 --> 52:35.760
chanting to keep it there so they have a kind of continuous rotation of homeless people who

52:37.040 --> 52:42.080
kind of sort of volunteer for it like they they they they're glad to be keeping that thing they're

52:42.080 --> 52:46.640
well compensated all right well that's better that's better than death masses you are not off

52:46.640 --> 52:54.240
the hook kathy i am now clearly thank you for getting me off the hook all right hey kathy good

52:54.240 --> 53:03.520

53:12.160 --> 53:16.560

53:51.520 --> 53:56.480
foot from yard she wasn't even trying to kill me she shot me right where it couldn't kill me she's

53:56.480 --> 54:01.760
a crack shot damn it i forgot you shot keith and that makes you at least half all right in my book

54:04.000 --> 54:09.840
and i look down for a second and i'm like well anything that what did i do to my friends anything

54:09.840 --> 54:15.120

54:52.960 --> 54:57.360

55:47.920 --> 55:51.120
and kathy looks at you and she's like what do you want to talk about

55:51.120 --> 55:59.680
uh i i just wanted to pick your brain for a second here um do you trust maggie maggie

55:59.680 --> 56:05.680
yeah you've been providing bodies it sounds like to her and jim for a while now i just

56:05.680 --> 56:09.760
wonder what your thoughts on her are right now oh she's certainly a little bit more rough around the

56:09.760 --> 56:16.080
edges than her old man was that's for sure she's been fine to deal with on my end but you know she

56:16.160 --> 56:23.040
does have that fire in her eye in the last i don't know a couple years how long you've been

56:23.040 --> 56:30.000
how long you've been providing bodies to them homeless folks to them gosh 20 years is there

56:30.000 --> 56:35.600
any chance in the last year or two um they were coming back any different if the homeless people

56:35.600 --> 56:40.320
ever spoken to you about changes or things that have been different about their time there at the

56:40.320 --> 56:46.560
circle or now in the past what since the changeover happened you know about the changeover well i

56:46.560 --> 56:52.080
mean clearly maggie's in charge now and because her old man died right jim died yeah yeah i was

56:52.080 --> 56:57.120
i was wondering if there's been a change strangled in an alleyway in the city can you imagine god

56:58.400 --> 57:03.040
anyway uh yeah no he was a he was a fine man to deal with seemed like he had his head on his

57:03.040 --> 57:08.160
shoulders straight you know maybe a little bit of an alcohol problem but past that man who doesn't

57:08.160 --> 57:16.160

57:27.840 --> 57:32.320

58:16.560 --> 58:22.400
means well you you said it yourself people have been disappearing all over contention yeah but

58:22.400 --> 58:29.520
i didn't think actually disappearing like not existing anymore well we're not exactly sure

58:29.520 --> 58:36.640
that's exactly the case but that's what it looks like right now you saw my brother-in-law leo

you and starts sobbing into your shoulder i uh clark doesn't know how to react to that very well

59:30.560 --> 59:36.160
