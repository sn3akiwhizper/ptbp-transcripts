WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.180
Salutations, my little honeybees.

00:03.180 --> 00:06.980
It's your beekeeper, Beastie Wolf, the dog.

00:06.980 --> 00:09.780
I'm here to protect you at all costs

00:09.780 --> 00:11.380
while getting a little taste

00:11.380 --> 00:15.260
of that sweet, sticky honey every now and then.

00:15.260 --> 00:18.100
I can't wait to make some toilet wine

00:18.100 --> 00:20.220
with y'all's sweet syrup.

00:20.220 --> 00:25.220
I am buzzin' at you live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:26.160 --> 00:29.700
the only radio station located

00:29.700 --> 00:33.180
in a trash hive of my own making.

00:33.180 --> 00:35.140
What's that sound?

00:35.140 --> 00:36.380
Is it the mail truck?

00:36.380 --> 00:39.460
They're saying I got a new Howlin' with Wolf, baby.

00:39.460 --> 00:43.660
This fine edition of Howlin' with Wolf is from Bee.

00:43.660 --> 00:45.020
Very nice.

00:45.020 --> 00:48.540
Who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

00:48.540 --> 00:51.840
proving that even the busiest bees can take time

00:51.840 --> 00:55.240
to make this old Wolfie feel something again.

00:55.240 --> 00:56.640
They right.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.040
Have you seen the yellow sub?

00:59.040 --> 01:01.840
Have you felt its honey mustard contours

01:01.840 --> 01:06.280
dripping around the edges of that braised brain of yours,

01:06.280 --> 01:10.000
encased in a sun-toasted bread of skin and bone?

01:10.000 --> 01:13.040
The sponge monkey elders assure you

01:13.040 --> 01:15.840
those are olives, not eyes.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.080
And if you haven't seen the yellow sign,

01:18.080 --> 01:21.320
I mean sub, you will soon.

01:21.720 --> 01:26.080
Damn, Bee, don't threaten to dog the wolf with a good time.

01:26.080 --> 01:29.680
You're talking about toast, you're talking about mustard,

01:29.680 --> 01:34.160
and braising, and goddamn, I am fucking pumped

01:34.160 --> 01:37.900
for whatever the hell it is you are talking about.

01:37.900 --> 01:41.520
If you wanna write up something for your honey wolf to howl,

01:41.520 --> 01:45.520
tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram,

01:45.520 --> 01:48.880
or write up a five-star review on Apple Podcasts

01:48.880 --> 01:53.240
and let my producer know at pretendingpod at gmail.com.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.720
And if you're already wrist-deep in the interwebs,

01:56.720 --> 01:59.660
go ahead and share the trailer for season one

01:59.660 --> 02:01.760
of Pretending to Be People.

02:01.760 --> 02:05.520
Share it on the mountain, share it over the hills,

02:05.520 --> 02:07.820
share it everywhere.

02:07.820 --> 02:12.120
Jesus Christ wouldn't have been so him-damn-bored.

02:12.120 --> 02:13.720
God damn it, Zach.

02:13.720 --> 02:17.140
If he had access to all this sweet content

02:17.140 --> 02:21.740
in the show notes, and if that ain't the truth,

02:21.740 --> 02:24.100
then this ain't the news.

02:24.100 --> 02:28.020
Last time, we lost a few dear friends.

02:28.020 --> 02:30.580
Please bow your heads and take a moment

02:30.580 --> 02:33.920
to reflect on the lives of Jimmy Sanders,

02:33.920 --> 02:37.140
Carmen the Possum, Harry Klinker,

02:37.140 --> 02:40.220
Rusty the Distinguished Gray Dog,

02:40.220 --> 02:44.000
Professor Horace Green, and the decapitated head

02:44.000 --> 02:47.420
of preacher-sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.280
Damn, I miss all them.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.520
Then the ball that is John Lee Pettymore

02:53.520 --> 02:56.280
summoned Planet Juggernaut and friends

02:56.280 --> 03:01.280
to fight alongside the Overseer against Rose Mary

03:02.160 --> 03:06.040
in this gigantopumpathy-pipicus.

03:06.040 --> 03:09.740
Taking us to the top of round one is Dragon in 3

03:09.740 --> 03:13.360
with What Kind of World Are You Living In?

03:13.360 --> 03:18.360
["What Kind of World Are You Living In?" by Dragon in 3 plays in the background.]

03:43.360 --> 03:48.360
["What Kind of World Are You Living In?" by Dragon in 3 plays in the background.]

03:52.720 --> 03:56.000
Whoa, whoa, everybody, welcome.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
My name is Nick Nichols and I am here with my brother, Nick.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.040
Wait.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.320
I forgot my name.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.380
I'm Nick, you're Nick.

04:07.380 --> 04:11.600
We're all Nick for Nichols, and welcome.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.520
We are here in, oh my goodness,

04:14.520 --> 04:17.120
where the fuck are we, Nick?

04:17.120 --> 04:21.000
I don't seem to know, but it is terrifying me to my core.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.540
I am scared.

04:22.540 --> 04:24.440
Look at that big fucker on the left.

04:24.440 --> 04:27.480
And we've got, thankfully, bringing us home,

04:27.480 --> 04:29.160
giving us some shelter with it,

04:29.160 --> 04:33.880
I don't know, that hurts, is Planet Juggernaut.

04:33.880 --> 04:38.400
Thanks, Nick, I'm just glad to be here.

04:38.440 --> 04:42.680
I'm really excited to start mixing it up again.

04:42.680 --> 04:47.440
Gotta admit, this is a little fancier than this crap pit,

04:47.440 --> 04:50.640
but I think I can still be a scrapper.

04:50.640 --> 04:54.200
Hope I can put on a good show for you guys.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.900
Back to you, Dick and Nick.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.760
Dick is dead.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.320
Nick and Nick Nichols here,

05:05.360 --> 05:10.200
and we are gonna go now to our correspondent.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.880
I see him, he's running a buck.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.680
He just came down in a full Technicolor flash

05:15.680 --> 05:17.120
of light over there.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.320
He is crying on the ground.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.160
It's Jeremiah Jones Johnson.

05:22.160 --> 05:25.800
Let's go with him now and see what's going on.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.160
What do you think about that, Nick?

05:28.160 --> 05:30.400
As before, I just always love to hear

05:30.400 --> 05:32.380
my boy Jeremiah say stuff.

05:35.480 --> 05:39.280
Hello, it's Jeremiah Jones Johnson here,

05:39.280 --> 05:42.680
and I don't know where the fuck he is,

05:42.680 --> 05:47.000
but we're gonna try to find out now.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
And he walks over and sees a few other people

05:50.000 --> 05:52.500
who've just been seemingly teleported

05:52.500 --> 05:54.320
into this plane of existence,

05:54.320 --> 05:57.820
three individuals who have just made their way

05:57.820 --> 06:01.840
onto this plane, standing on the ground made of light.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.600
What's your name?

06:04.760 --> 06:05.960
I'm Brad.

06:05.960 --> 06:09.000
Hey, Brad, where are we?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.560
It's the dark world.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.800
I gather it's the dark world.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.920
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

06:17.920 --> 06:22.040
And he pulls a T-shirt out from behind his back

06:22.040 --> 06:23.280
and hands it to you.

06:25.160 --> 06:28.280
Oh, sweet, hell yeah, thanks, Jeremiah.

06:28.280 --> 06:33.280
And you, you're, what's your name, sir?

06:33.560 --> 06:38.280
My name is Patrick Star, and, wait, is that?

06:38.280 --> 06:43.280
Is that the SpongeBob character or the porn guy?

06:46.120 --> 06:46.960
Okay.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.840
Well, let's take it down to Jeremiah Jones Johnson

06:52.840 --> 06:53.920
for our new game.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.900
Is it the SpongeBob character or the porn guy?

06:58.120 --> 07:00.640
My name is Patrick Star, and I disagree.

07:00.640 --> 07:01.820
We're not in the dark place.

07:01.820 --> 07:04.980
This is clearly heaven, and that's God,

07:04.980 --> 07:08.420
and I, for one, and I'm gonna go rush up and meet him.

07:08.420 --> 07:10.860
Okay, oh, and he's gone.

07:10.860 --> 07:12.580
He's running full armed, like,

07:12.580 --> 07:15.260
at the can't jump ropypicus.

07:15.260 --> 07:20.260
Okay, and Patrick Star runs directly toward one of the legs

07:20.700 --> 07:25.260
of this enormous, shadowy, dripping creature

07:25.260 --> 07:29.380
and disappears into it like a open door

07:29.380 --> 07:32.020
with only darkness on the other side of it,

07:32.020 --> 07:35.420
and he is no longer visible to the human eye

07:35.420 --> 07:37.580
or any other eyes.

07:37.580 --> 07:41.900
And this third person, who are you?

07:41.900 --> 07:44.780
Hey, you can just call me Jerry.

07:46.620 --> 07:47.840
Oh, hey, Jerry.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.580
Cool voice, what's your deal, man?

07:52.620 --> 07:57.300
My grandson brought me up to the city to go see the games,

07:57.300 --> 08:00.380
and well, this ain't the city.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.220
No, it's not.

08:01.220 --> 08:02.660
Back to you, Mick and Nick.

08:02.660 --> 08:07.500
Oh, thank you so much there, Jeremiah Jones Johnson.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.580
Jones, because I called you Jones Johnson

08:09.580 --> 08:10.980
because you called yourself Johnson.

08:10.980 --> 08:12.380
Somebody else called you Johnson,

08:12.380 --> 08:13.660
so we're good with all of it.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.700
Jeremiah Jones Johnson corresponding on the field.

08:15.700 --> 08:16.540
Thank you so much.

08:16.540 --> 08:18.140
Nick Nichols, what do you think about all that?

08:18.140 --> 08:20.860
You know, I've said it a thousand times.

08:20.860 --> 08:22.900
Every time Jeremiah says things,

08:22.900 --> 08:26.240
I light up with a joy that just cannot be found

08:26.240 --> 08:28.640
in any other place in my life.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.480
What?

08:33.080 --> 08:35.640
Let's go down to the field and see what happens.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.680
This massive, lumbering, shadowy, dripping creature

08:39.680 --> 08:42.800
that we've been calling the Gigant Umbropithecus

08:42.800 --> 08:46.960
because someone in the circle of knowledge called it that,

08:46.960 --> 08:51.960
grabs out with one of its enormous, massive arms now,

08:52.240 --> 08:57.240
so large that it can hold onto the illuminated pipe

08:58.040 --> 09:01.400
that is hanging in the sky with its hand.

09:01.400 --> 09:06.080
Once trapped inside this eternal treadmill prison,

09:06.080 --> 09:10.640
it can now hold the entirety of its former...

09:12.160 --> 09:13.680
Cage.

09:13.680 --> 09:17.720
Thank you, cage, within its grasp.

09:17.760 --> 09:22.560
It rips and throws this toilet paper holder

09:22.560 --> 09:24.600
with light shining out through the middle of it,

09:24.600 --> 09:28.160
throws this thing behind it as its other hand

09:28.160 --> 09:33.160
reaches up and touches the sky.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.000
It's gonna testify.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.120
It's up in this spot.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.760
Luke, how do you think it looks?

09:41.640 --> 09:42.480
Fuck.

09:42.480 --> 09:43.800
That's right, extra fly.

09:43.800 --> 09:44.640
Extra fly.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.880
It touches...

09:49.520 --> 09:53.880
It touches the dark sky above,

09:53.880 --> 09:58.880
which immediately breaks and waves begin to form

09:59.240 --> 10:03.520
an ocean of black ichor.

10:03.520 --> 10:08.520
It is moving like dark, lagoon-y waters.

10:08.840 --> 10:13.160
So gravity, seemingly, up there is opposite

10:13.160 --> 10:15.280
of the gravity that you're on.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.080
Does that sound cool?

10:17.080 --> 10:17.920
Yeah.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.240
Gravity.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.280
A dark sky sea of endless blackness.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.600
A dark-sized ski of endless darkness.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.440
That's right, yeah.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.760
Stark ski and hutch.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.320
Word association.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.720
Yeah, kids, if you wanna know how to be funny,

10:39.720 --> 10:42.920
just remember what sounds sound like other sounds.

10:42.920 --> 10:46.200
Yeah, it works 100%.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.920
And blurt that out almost compulsively

10:49.920 --> 10:52.040
and you'll be just like your best friends,

10:52.040 --> 10:53.760
the boys at PDBP.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.440
PDBP.

10:59.560 --> 11:01.960
Everyone's best friend, PDBP.

11:01.960 --> 11:06.960
Rose M-A-R-Y looks at this new set of issues.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.840
She's coming straight for Planet Juggernaut.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.720
Two of her metal tendrils slam down

11:11.760 --> 11:14.160
into the illuminated ground below her

11:14.160 --> 11:19.160
and she flings herself toward this enormous, robust sphere,

11:19.240 --> 11:21.720
a larger version of what controls her.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.680
And the other two tendrils are going to try

11:23.680 --> 11:26.920
to penetrate the armor of Planet Juggernaut.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.160
Does he get a reaction?

11:28.160 --> 11:29.000
A hundred.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.640
Laser eyes.

11:31.640 --> 11:35.440
Fuck yes, all right, let's roll.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.800
Mother fucking shit.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.680
What did you roll?

11:40.680 --> 11:43.480
I rolled a 66, it's a critical something.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.920
It's a critical something.

11:45.920 --> 11:49.240
I don't know Juggernaut stats, I don't have Mandy.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.200
Would they be in the big thing of...

11:51.200 --> 11:54.800
Much like Nick Cage, you don't have Mandy.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.880
Fuck, no, cut all that.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.240
Why don't you have your stats?

12:06.240 --> 12:09.040
Dude, I don't know where our giant robot stats are.

12:09.040 --> 12:12.920
Thomas, they probably don't exist anywhere.

12:12.920 --> 12:16.200
I just wrote them on a piece of paper for you one day,

12:16.200 --> 12:17.040
like years ago.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.760
I do explicitly remember you just jotting them down

12:19.760 --> 12:22.080
on like a scratch piece of paper and we used that.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.800
It was a scratch piece of paper, why don't you have it?

12:24.800 --> 12:27.640
I'll look for it in the box real quick.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.520
He had real good stats.

12:29.520 --> 12:33.000
Let me pull up the pulp Cthulhu rules.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.880
I'm pretty sure that's what I pulled it from.

12:34.880 --> 12:35.920
Yeah, because I remember you based it

12:35.920 --> 12:37.520
on something you found.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.720
Found pulp Cthulhu.

12:41.720 --> 12:46.440
Robots tend to come in two varieties, giant and killer.

12:48.720 --> 12:51.640
Laser beam, 80%.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.480
Hell yeah.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.880
Critical success.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.000
Nice.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.360
Damage 2D10, so roll 4D10.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.200
Hell yeah.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.120
10 and two for the first ones,

13:04.120 --> 13:06.120
10 and two again for the second ones.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.200
Whoa.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.520
Damn.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.400
That's wild.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.800
24 points of damage.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.040
God's here guys.

13:18.080 --> 13:23.080
Describe how these lasers absolutely wreck shop

13:23.120 --> 13:25.840
taking over half of Rosemary's hit points.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.240
She was coming at him.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.280
How was she coming at him?

13:28.280 --> 13:31.760
She flinged herself at this planet juggernaut

13:31.760 --> 13:34.280
with two metal tendrils shoved into the ground

13:34.280 --> 13:37.800
and the other two are in attack mode

13:37.800 --> 13:40.360
trying to stab into the planet juggernaut.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.040
Okay, so with surprising swiftness,

13:43.040 --> 13:46.680
planet juggernaut's eyes kind of swing around

13:46.680 --> 13:48.560
and lock onto Rosemary.

13:48.560 --> 13:52.320
They flash red, two beams come out of either eye

13:52.320 --> 13:55.360
and you see the tip of the tendrils

13:55.360 --> 13:56.720
that are like about to attack them

13:56.720 --> 13:59.760
just kind of slice clean off.

13:59.760 --> 14:03.040
And so he destroys like half of her body, he said.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.760
Yeah, yeah.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.240
So it's exactly like a dope fucking samurai movie

14:08.240 --> 14:11.240
where you see the lasers seemingly

14:11.240 --> 14:12.400
go right through her middle,

14:12.400 --> 14:13.960
but nothing happens for a second.

14:13.960 --> 14:17.880
And then the bottom half just slides away,

14:17.880 --> 14:21.520
but you can still see like anger actively on her face,

14:21.520 --> 14:24.200
but it's more like annoyance as she begins

14:24.200 --> 14:27.440
to just climb out of this Rosemary like shell.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.280
Keith, it's your turn.

14:33.280 --> 14:36.360
Am I on planet juggernaut or am I on the ground?

14:36.360 --> 14:38.560
You are in a very dark building.

14:38.560 --> 14:39.800
Oh, that Keith.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.120
That Keith.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.840
Yeah, there's a few, I think.

14:43.840 --> 14:47.320
Keith, I guess, what has Don done to me?

14:47.320 --> 14:51.040
You are being held by the caller by Don D. Pettymore

14:51.040 --> 14:53.400
and he is angrily yelling at you

14:53.400 --> 14:56.360
because he has just seemingly failed.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.880
His whole mission was getting to this phone

14:58.880 --> 15:01.520
and then he seems disappointed by the results.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.880
Hey man, what's your problem?

15:03.880 --> 15:04.920
What's going on?

15:07.280 --> 15:08.880
It's all good in here.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.040
I love this because I feel like I'm shaking you.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.240
I'm just like limply like.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.240
For listeners at home,

15:23.240 --> 15:26.520
Luke just did the thing that like inflatable men do

15:26.520 --> 15:29.080
in front of big car dealerships.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.640
More like Muppets do when they're excited.

15:34.640 --> 15:39.640
But your voice belies the extreme emotion of the situation.

15:40.480 --> 15:45.320
Hey man, the phone, what is it?

15:45.320 --> 15:46.560
They didn't say anything to me.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.360
It's all, none of this means anything.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.400
Don't you, why don't you fucking understand?

15:51.400 --> 15:53.560
Well, let me give it a try.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.600
Give it to me, give it to me.

15:56.680 --> 16:00.240
Don D. Pettymore like kind of immediately stops

16:01.320 --> 16:05.480
and just drops you but he doesn't give you the phone

16:05.480 --> 16:07.080
but he kind of walks away from you.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.760
Can I get up and go to the phone?

16:09.720 --> 16:10.560
Yeah, sure.

16:10.560 --> 16:11.380
I get up and go to the phone.

16:11.380 --> 16:12.220
Yeah.

16:14.220 --> 16:17.040
I pick it up.

16:17.040 --> 16:20.000
I'm like blindly feeling around for it

16:20.000 --> 16:20.840
because I can't say anything.

16:20.840 --> 16:21.680
There it is, yeah.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.320
And you blew the candle out.

16:27.160 --> 16:30.200
So go ahead and roll on whether or not

16:30.200 --> 16:32.280
you can find this phone this turn.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.480
Just a 50-50.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.400
No, roll luck.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.880
17, I pass.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.320
And so you grab onto this phone

16:43.320 --> 16:45.600
and when you lift it to your ear, you hear.

16:48.820 --> 16:52.540
Hello, this is Keith, who's this?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.960
Roll intelligence.

17:10.240 --> 17:11.080
I fail.

17:12.140 --> 17:12.980
Shocker.

17:21.180 --> 17:23.400
What is Keith's intelligence?

17:23.400 --> 17:24.240
50.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.080
All right.

17:25.080 --> 17:27.440
Not bad, I got a 63 on a 50.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.880
You're not really able to put together

17:29.880 --> 17:33.040
what you recognize this sound from

17:33.040 --> 17:36.040
but you know that it sounds familiar.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.080
Hmm, Don, this sounds familiar.

17:38.080 --> 17:41.320
I'm gonna maybe just keep listening to it for a second

17:41.320 --> 17:44.120
and maybe in just a little bit I'll be able to,

17:44.120 --> 17:45.040
it'll come to me.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.600
And Don's in the corner like,

17:46.600 --> 17:49.320
the fucking piece of shit thinks he's better than me,

17:49.320 --> 17:50.400
thinks he can use the phone.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.760
I'm the one who came down here to get the fucking phone

17:52.760 --> 17:55.300
but I'm not talking to anyone in particular.

17:56.320 --> 17:59.200
I grab the phone, like the base of the phone

17:59.200 --> 18:00.980
and I lay back down on the ground

18:00.980 --> 18:03.720
and just like hold the receiver up to my ear

18:03.720 --> 18:05.040
and keep listening to it.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.520
Just waiting for the internet company to get back to you.

18:16.580 --> 18:20.180
Back on the illuminated battlefield,

18:20.180 --> 18:22.620
creatures appear out of nowhere

18:22.620 --> 18:26.220
in between the dark oozing ocean above you

18:26.220 --> 18:29.500
and the illuminated land below you.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.540
Above you and below you, what did I say?

18:32.460 --> 18:35.540
Between the, whatever.

18:35.540 --> 18:36.380
And,

18:40.220 --> 18:42.380
Who the fucking gives a shit?

18:42.380 --> 18:45.460
Nobody cares, nobody's listening anymore.

18:45.460 --> 18:47.480
This nerd shit doesn't matter.

18:47.480 --> 18:51.480
This isn't, none of this is real.

18:53.880 --> 18:56.680
Guys, we only had four listens on the last episode

18:56.680 --> 18:58.680
which means one of us didn't listen to it.

18:58.680 --> 19:03.680
Who gives a flying fuck?

19:05.160 --> 19:09.280
Between the dark, mysterious choppy waters above you

19:09.280 --> 19:13.440
and the bright light shining up from below,

19:13.440 --> 19:16.920
in this air of nothingness in between,

19:18.120 --> 19:22.720
massive creatures with gaunt frames

19:22.720 --> 19:27.720
in black suits with translucent skin fall to the ground.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.880
And as they do, they are surrounding

19:31.880 --> 19:36.840
this luminous land liturgy that is worshiping the overseer.

19:36.840 --> 19:40.480
They look directly at this floating man,

19:40.480 --> 19:45.480
his arms out with his dark robes and his cowboy hat.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.560
And in unison, they all say,

19:49.560 --> 19:54.560
Hello, subject 1522518195518, we found you.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.840
Please come with us.

19:59.840 --> 20:04.000
And they all reach out their hands simultaneously.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.840
It's the overseer's turn.

20:05.840 --> 20:06.920
Clark, go ahead and roll

20:06.920 --> 20:09.200
for the alternate version of yourself.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.360
Go ahead and roll for Clark Old.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.760
Okay, what am I rolling?

20:12.760 --> 20:15.400
Just up and down, D100.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.800
It's an 11.

20:20.800 --> 20:24.840
Oh, it's a critical.

20:24.840 --> 20:27.000
I'm showing the camera to the dice.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.080
It is a straight up 11.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.880
You see his arms move out.

20:31.880 --> 20:34.840
His right arm is pulled to one side by one of them.

20:34.840 --> 20:38.000
His left hand is pulled to the side by another

20:38.000 --> 20:39.200
with their minds.

20:39.200 --> 20:42.600
His legs are held down by two of the others.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.480
You see he's fighting against it.

20:45.560 --> 20:48.320
But one of them is trying to get a hold of his head.

20:48.320 --> 20:53.120
His entire face becomes engulfed in light.

20:53.120 --> 20:58.120
And he beams this light at one of these gaunt

20:59.680 --> 21:03.000
alien creatures wearing black suit.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
It's translucent skin pops puss and ooze.

21:09.720 --> 21:14.720
Not green, not yellow, just this clear milky slime.

21:15.320 --> 21:20.160
Hits the ground in a pile of a black suit covered in...

21:20.160 --> 21:22.400
Nope, I'm gonna throw up.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.920
The popping of pimples really gets me.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.840
That's like fucking disgusting.

21:26.840 --> 21:31.800
So, it's like with the beam,

21:31.800 --> 21:34.400
he's got fingers on either side of just this

21:35.600 --> 21:38.880
volcano eruption of puss.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.800
Just comes out, I'm gonna throw up.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.880
And then he turns and looks at another one

21:44.880 --> 21:46.560
because he critically succeeded.

21:46.560 --> 21:50.120
And he does it to a second one, looks at a third one,

21:50.120 --> 21:51.160
does it to a third one.

21:51.160 --> 21:54.320
There's only two more left on the field.

21:54.320 --> 21:56.760
You ever DM so hard you make yourself throw up?

22:00.720 --> 22:04.880
Clark Old, they're not Clark Old, just Clark Bishop.

22:04.880 --> 22:05.720
It's your turn.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.880
Clark, my Clark, our Clark,

22:07.880 --> 22:10.040
the Clark we've all come to know and love.

22:10.080 --> 22:14.520
He just saw what he thinks that he can become.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.400
And he wants to do that.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.240
He wants to be that.

22:18.240 --> 22:21.200
And so he's just gonna do like he did with Anne Love

22:21.200 --> 22:24.360
and try and imitate everything he just saw the overseer do.

22:24.360 --> 22:27.120
And he wants to try and make his face turn into bright light

22:27.120 --> 22:29.560
that pops translucent beings.

22:29.560 --> 22:31.520
Okay, go ahead and roll a natural.

22:31.520 --> 22:32.360
The two that popped,

22:32.360 --> 22:33.840
are they the ones that have his hands?

22:33.840 --> 22:35.640
Yeah, but not physically.

22:35.640 --> 22:36.560
Okay, gotcha, gotcha.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.120
They were like away from him.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.120
They're holding him with that grip

22:40.120 --> 22:44.160
that one of them used on Keith Beans earlier in the show.

22:44.160 --> 22:47.680
And Marvin Glass used on Clark Bishop at one point in time

22:47.680 --> 22:50.640
where they can physically grab you from further away.

22:50.640 --> 22:52.760
Like Darth Vader, I like Star Wars.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.920
I like Star Wars a lot.

22:54.920 --> 22:58.160
Yeah, I'm popping the other two, trying to.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.640
And it's a pass, a 28 on a 63.

23:04.640 --> 23:08.480
They rolled a 17 earlier against Clark Gold

23:08.480 --> 23:10.960
and that roll carries over to yours,

23:10.960 --> 23:12.280
which means that you succeed

23:12.280 --> 23:14.280
in being able to do this to one of them.

23:14.280 --> 23:18.000
Please, can you describe it so I don't gak in my own throat?

23:20.400 --> 23:22.400
As I said, he's imitating what he had seen.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.360
He doesn't know exact,

23:24.360 --> 23:29.360
he saw the concentration that Clark Gold exuded

23:30.480 --> 23:32.760
and that he just tries to mimic that.

23:32.760 --> 23:35.600
He just tries to scrunch his face up a little bit,

23:35.600 --> 23:38.600
clear his mind as much as possible and just picture light.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.640
He just wants to picture light.

23:39.640 --> 23:41.720
He doesn't know a hundred percent if it's gonna work,

23:41.720 --> 23:44.180
but it kind of did that last time with the blood thing.

23:44.180 --> 23:47.960
And he thinks that maybe, I don't, and his head,

23:47.960 --> 23:51.380
just like a light bulb turning on illuminates

23:51.380 --> 23:53.680
and it kind of startles him even

23:53.680 --> 23:57.640
as there's now a bunch of light flooded the area around him.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.880
And he just directs it all as much as he can

23:59.880 --> 24:00.840
into one of them.

24:00.840 --> 24:04.200
And as though being squeezed on both sides,

24:04.200 --> 24:08.040
goo erupts off the top of one of these things,

24:08.040 --> 24:11.320
popping its head, fully volcanoing and splashing outward,

24:11.320 --> 24:14.320
maybe probably hitting some of the people in the circle

24:14.320 --> 24:17.940
with some pretty awful, pretty awful awful.

24:17.940 --> 24:18.840
Awful awful.

24:18.840 --> 24:20.840
It's this guy named Zach who's in the crowd

24:20.840 --> 24:23.080
and it's like really warm and he can feel it.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.200
Gets in his mouth a little.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.480
Yeah. Gets in his mouth.

24:25.480 --> 24:26.320
Oh!

24:27.840 --> 24:29.480
Zach falls to his knees,

24:29.520 --> 24:31.480
begins throwing up on the ground

24:31.480 --> 24:35.280
and gets trampled by some of the other chanting people.

24:36.800 --> 24:40.360
Clark is also, he's like proud of himself

24:40.360 --> 24:44.240
and he gives a thumbs up to Clark Old and a smile.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.960
Like, I did good, dad, huh?

24:48.760 --> 24:51.080
At this moment, you see all the anger

24:51.080 --> 24:55.600
that had come from Clark Old previously dissipates

24:55.600 --> 24:59.640
and he looks at you with this,

24:59.640 --> 25:04.360
that moment when a father realizes-

25:04.360 --> 25:05.200
TFW.

25:08.900 --> 25:10.400
I thought you said DFW and I was like-

25:10.400 --> 25:11.400
Like Dallas, Fort Worth?

25:11.400 --> 25:12.920
The pride that all fathers have

25:12.920 --> 25:17.120
in the Dallas International Airport shines on his face.

25:17.120 --> 25:19.520
Dad's face when- No, he looks at you and it's-

25:19.520 --> 25:20.360
Oh!

25:24.200 --> 25:25.040
Yeah.

25:26.560 --> 25:31.040
So what's the prevailing jiff of someone becoming,

25:31.040 --> 25:33.440
oh yeah, it's the guy in the woods with the,

25:34.800 --> 25:35.640
is it Grizzly Adams?

25:35.640 --> 25:37.120
That's what I was thinking of too.

25:38.320 --> 25:39.720
Just the single head nod.

25:39.720 --> 25:40.560
It's not Grizzly Adams.

25:40.560 --> 25:44.360
It's not Grizzly Adams, but it's the guy in the woods.

25:44.360 --> 25:45.840
Is it Jeremiah Johnson?

25:45.840 --> 25:47.920
No, it's something else.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.120
Jeremiah Johnson.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.760
Jeremiah Johnson- The nodding man?

25:50.760 --> 25:52.320
On the field reporting.

25:52.320 --> 25:53.160
Yeah, the nodding man.

25:53.240 --> 25:54.800
Robert Redford.

25:54.800 --> 25:55.640
No, it's not.

25:55.640 --> 25:56.480
What?

25:56.480 --> 25:57.320
Is it not?

25:57.320 --> 25:58.160
No, it's not.

25:58.160 --> 25:59.000
I found it though.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.600
Nodding man, jiff.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.960
I sent it to the Discord.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.280
Origin.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.040
Yeah, but I'm looking for who it is.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.520
It is Jeremiah Johnson.

26:06.520 --> 26:07.360
Yeah.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.200
That is-

26:08.200 --> 26:10.320
This man is actually Robert Redford.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.760
Dude, it is Robert Redford.

26:11.760 --> 26:13.560
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.880
Wait, no, Robert Redford is Jeremiah Johnson,

26:15.880 --> 26:18.360
but that nodding man is not Robert Redford.

26:18.360 --> 26:19.200
Oh, okay.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.040
That's what I was thinking.

26:20.040 --> 26:20.960
Oh.

26:20.960 --> 26:21.800
Who is this then?

26:21.800 --> 26:22.620
I don't think.

26:23.020 --> 26:23.860
It doesn't look like-

26:23.860 --> 26:26.300
It's a gif of Robert Redford playing titular role

26:26.300 --> 26:28.380
of the 1972 film, Jeremiah Johnson.

26:28.380 --> 26:31.580
Dude, he looks so thick in that movie.

26:31.580 --> 26:32.420
Weird.

26:32.420 --> 26:33.900
Yeah, that doesn't really look like him.

26:33.900 --> 26:34.740
It's wild.

26:34.740 --> 26:35.940
I love that there's a lot that just says this is-

26:35.940 --> 26:37.260
He's an ugly motherfucker.

26:37.260 --> 26:41.300
That just say Zach Galifianakis is this man,

26:41.300 --> 26:43.340
when it's clearly from the 70s.

26:43.340 --> 26:44.860
Yeah.

26:44.860 --> 26:46.980
Dude, he was like a heartthrob though, like-

26:46.980 --> 26:48.540
What is he holding in that gif?

26:48.540 --> 26:50.460
What the fuck?

26:50.460 --> 26:51.300
You know-

26:51.300 --> 26:52.140
A rifle.

26:52.740 --> 26:54.220
There are shots of him in that movie

26:54.220 --> 26:56.260
where he doesn't look like he does in that gif.

26:56.260 --> 26:58.180
He's holding it to the side.

26:58.180 --> 26:59.900
Yeah, every other picture of him in the movie

26:59.900 --> 27:01.980
looks like Robert Redford when you pull it up.

27:01.980 --> 27:03.180
Exactly.

27:03.180 --> 27:05.460
Only this one looks like Zach Galifianakis.

27:05.460 --> 27:06.780
It's really fucking weird.

27:10.700 --> 27:11.780
Okay.

27:11.780 --> 27:15.220
He looks at you like Robert Redford and Jeremiah Johnson

27:16.180 --> 27:20.380
and just slowly gives you that slight smile and head nod.

27:20.380 --> 27:22.540
And that feels real good to Clark.

27:22.540 --> 27:23.380
Don.

27:23.380 --> 27:27.340
Does Don hear New Commotion from outside?

27:27.340 --> 27:28.180
Oh yeah, dude.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.020
Or what's the building?

27:29.020 --> 27:30.940
I didn't know if the building is like sound insulated

27:30.940 --> 27:32.060
or some weird shit.

27:32.060 --> 27:34.780
It is, but just enough to where you can hear

27:34.780 --> 27:37.700
New Sound Commotion from outside.

27:37.700 --> 27:40.820
New Sound Commotion is my favorite band for teenagers.

27:42.260 --> 27:43.980
Teenagers.

27:43.980 --> 27:45.860
With the hit single New Sound Commotion

27:45.860 --> 27:48.340
on the new debut album, Hit Sound Commotion.

27:48.340 --> 27:49.500
New Sound Commotion.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.460
Hit Sound Commotion.

27:51.460 --> 27:53.260
Rocking like the ocean.

27:54.580 --> 27:56.660
Is it above you or below you?

27:56.660 --> 27:59.580
I'm like, hey boy, are they, can you speak to them?

28:00.500 --> 28:01.340
Are you talking?

28:06.780 --> 28:08.460
Is that what Keith is doing right now?

28:08.460 --> 28:09.660
Yeah, into the phone.

28:10.620 --> 28:11.780
Jesus Christ.

28:12.980 --> 28:13.820
Oh God.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.700
I don't fucking know.

28:18.620 --> 28:21.420
As he says that, you hear the same noise that you heard

28:21.420 --> 28:23.260
on the other end of the telephone.

28:23.260 --> 28:28.260
That's like, this noise comes from outside.

28:28.420 --> 28:29.260
You hear it.

28:29.260 --> 28:31.020
So I think when I hear that noise,

28:31.020 --> 28:32.980
it'll like click in my head and I'll be like,

28:32.980 --> 28:36.580
maybe they're here to help and I'll sprint downstairs.

28:36.580 --> 28:39.460
Jon, it's Ball's turn.

28:39.460 --> 28:42.220
Ball, while Mary has been caught off guard

28:42.220 --> 28:45.300
by Planet Juggernaut, or is at least, you know.

28:45.300 --> 28:46.420
Caught off guard.

28:46.420 --> 28:47.940
Yes, sliced in half.

28:50.020 --> 28:54.300
As Mary Ball and like Octopus is like moving out

28:54.300 --> 28:59.300
of Mary body, Jon Ball, just in pure tiny silver form,

28:59.660 --> 29:01.900
whips at her as hard as he can,

29:01.900 --> 29:05.260
is gonna try to just knock her on her ass,

29:05.260 --> 29:06.980
basically, on her ball.

29:06.980 --> 29:08.260
A ball on ball.

29:08.260 --> 29:09.100
This is dope.

29:10.060 --> 29:13.020
All right, let's tangle some wires.

29:13.020 --> 29:15.060
What should we roll for this?

29:15.060 --> 29:16.540
Oh yeah, roll ball.

29:18.140 --> 29:20.180
Get the Pulp Cthulhu ball stats.

29:21.740 --> 29:23.140
Roll a natural.

29:23.140 --> 29:23.980
Okay.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.740
80, fail.

29:26.740 --> 29:29.060
75, pass.

29:29.060 --> 29:33.020
The ball of Jon Lee Pettymore lunges at the ball

29:33.020 --> 29:36.940
that is pulling itself out of the top half of the body

29:36.980 --> 29:40.900
of Rose M-A-R-Y, Rosemary.

29:40.900 --> 29:44.540
The clean cut across the leather jacket

29:44.540 --> 29:49.340
and white t-shirt of Rosemary is dripping with blood

29:49.340 --> 29:51.740
and you see as if sheet metal

29:51.740 --> 29:55.780
has been completely sliced clean.

29:55.780 --> 29:59.100
It's like a layer of t-shirt that is red,

29:59.100 --> 30:02.340
stained with blood, and then there's skin,

30:02.340 --> 30:05.460
and then there's this metal, and then there's more skin,

30:05.500 --> 30:07.740
and then there's reinforced metal,

30:07.740 --> 30:12.740
and then inside you just see these lengthy intestines

30:13.220 --> 30:17.580
spill out onto the illuminated land below.

30:17.580 --> 30:22.460
I don't, what if she keeps the top half of Rosemary

30:22.460 --> 30:24.260
and then it's a walking eye situation

30:24.260 --> 30:26.740
but with an angry Rosemary torso

30:26.740 --> 30:29.140
just dripping its intestines all over the place?

30:29.140 --> 30:32.420
There aren't a lot of moments in this show

30:32.420 --> 30:35.060
that make me as happy as the one

30:35.060 --> 30:37.340
that you've just suggested now.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.620
Thomas, 10 luck.

30:40.620 --> 30:41.540
Nice.

30:41.540 --> 30:44.460
And as you come at her, she kind of,

30:45.460 --> 30:50.020
she flips up to where you just barrel

30:50.020 --> 30:53.020
into the bottom half of Rosemary

30:53.020 --> 30:57.100
and your ball disappears up into the guts

30:57.100 --> 31:01.300
of Rosemary's body and you are stuck inside

31:01.300 --> 31:03.420
of this human goop.

31:03.420 --> 31:04.260
That's dope.

31:04.260 --> 31:07.300
I came from the muck and I'm stuck in the ball's guts.

31:07.300 --> 31:08.140
Oh no.

31:08.140 --> 31:10.980
I thought I'd get it.

31:10.980 --> 31:11.980
Back to the lab again.

31:11.980 --> 31:12.820
Yeah.

31:15.140 --> 31:20.140
And now we're gonna go to our newly minted old characters.

31:20.340 --> 31:23.860
They haven't been around since episode 46.

31:23.860 --> 31:28.740
It is the scrap pit versions of Keith, Clark,

31:28.740 --> 31:32.100
and then John, who is inside Planet Juggernaut.

31:32.100 --> 31:33.420
So we'll start with Keith.

31:33.420 --> 31:35.140
It is Keith's turn.

31:35.140 --> 31:36.020
Whoo!

31:36.020 --> 31:41.020
Keith just jumps with his pneumatic legs,

31:41.820 --> 31:44.340
jumps right at Mary,

31:44.340 --> 31:49.060
and starts shooting his freezing liquid

31:49.060 --> 31:54.060
and is aiming his legs to just smash into her frozen head.

31:55.460 --> 31:56.300
Radical.

31:56.300 --> 31:57.140
Or roll.

31:57.140 --> 31:58.940
Stankling icicle guts.

31:58.940 --> 32:01.820
Either one, depending on my roll.

32:03.300 --> 32:08.300
And 19, which I think is a pass.

32:08.420 --> 32:10.780
It is, but she uses her

32:10.780 --> 32:11.860
No, she doesn't.

32:11.860 --> 32:16.180
against John, which was a 75, which was also a pass.

32:16.180 --> 32:21.180
You freeze the whole bottom half of Rosemary

32:21.180 --> 32:26.180
and as you come down to try to take her on, essentially,

32:26.780 --> 32:31.020
she uses the two tendrils that haven't been sliced off

32:31.020 --> 32:34.220
to grab onto her frozen bottom half

32:34.220 --> 32:37.900
and hold it up like a ice cold shield

32:37.900 --> 32:42.900
that your fucking rad feet just boom and shatter

32:43.620 --> 32:47.300
and the bottom half of Rosemary just explodes

32:47.300 --> 32:51.460
into tiny little icicle pieces all over the ground.

32:51.460 --> 32:54.420
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

32:56.860 --> 33:01.140
And for the rest of the combat, I will call you Elsa.

33:02.420 --> 33:03.540
Clark Bishop, it's your turn.

33:03.540 --> 33:07.100
This Clark had stocked up on a bunch of stuff

33:07.100 --> 33:10.140
from a crazy room of providing.

33:10.140 --> 33:13.620
And I think I have a sniper rifle still.

33:13.620 --> 33:14.460
You do.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.380
So I'd like to shoot that sniper rifle

33:16.380 --> 33:21.380
aiming at where I think ball resides within Rosemary.

33:21.460 --> 33:24.420
I'm tracing the lines of the feet up to a point

33:24.420 --> 33:26.180
and I'm just taking aim at that point.

33:26.180 --> 33:27.020
Okay, yeah.

33:27.020 --> 33:29.020
The ball is actually visible currently,

33:29.020 --> 33:31.900
holding itself right above the top of her head.

33:31.900 --> 33:35.060
She's still in control of the top half of Rosemary

33:35.060 --> 33:36.940
through the spine with one tendril,

33:36.940 --> 33:40.940
but the ball itself is like she just got an idea.

33:40.940 --> 33:42.980
It is the light bulb right above her head.

33:42.980 --> 33:43.860
Oh, okay, cool.

33:43.860 --> 33:45.220
That's what I'm aiming for.

33:49.300 --> 33:51.380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

33:52.300 --> 33:56.700
Uh, that's a 99.

33:56.700 --> 33:58.060
Damn.

33:58.060 --> 34:02.380
That plays for this version of this Clark.

34:02.380 --> 34:05.900
He was not doing great in that fight anyway.

34:05.900 --> 34:07.940
He just popped up and was,

34:07.940 --> 34:08.780
what the fuck?

34:08.780 --> 34:09.620
Poof.

34:09.620 --> 34:12.500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

34:12.500 --> 34:16.100
This Clark was cursed by death magic and at zero sanity.

34:16.100 --> 34:16.940
That's true.

34:16.940 --> 34:17.780
Oh yeah.

34:17.780 --> 34:19.380
When he reaches back with one hand

34:19.420 --> 34:21.500
to grab onto the sniper rifle,

34:21.500 --> 34:24.100
his hand just immediately hits the trigger

34:24.100 --> 34:25.780
and he doesn't even see it coming

34:25.780 --> 34:28.420
because the barrel is right behind his head.

34:28.420 --> 34:31.340
The frontal lobe of Clark Bishop

34:31.340 --> 34:34.060
flies out the front of his skull.

34:34.060 --> 34:37.540
And I mean, his cranium is now shattered

34:37.540 --> 34:39.980
into 40 different pieces

34:39.980 --> 34:42.500
that then spray out onto the ground.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.380
The people who are chanting below

34:44.380 --> 34:48.780
look up as this third version of this same person

34:49.180 --> 34:52.700
just, and the headless body of Clark Bishop

34:52.700 --> 34:56.020
just kind of falls off the side of Planet Juggernaut

34:56.020 --> 34:58.420
and hits the ground shoulders first

34:58.420 --> 35:00.460
with no head to stop the fall.

35:00.460 --> 35:01.300
Damn.

35:01.300 --> 35:06.300
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

35:07.460 --> 35:08.900
Bye bye.

35:08.900 --> 35:09.780
That was quick.

35:09.780 --> 35:12.700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

35:12.700 --> 35:14.780
If Planet Juggernaut is a horse,

35:14.780 --> 35:18.260
then call that man a headless horse man.

35:18.260 --> 35:19.900
Oh my God, Nick Nichols.

35:19.900 --> 35:21.780
He was riding him and now he's not.

35:21.780 --> 35:24.660
My God, your wordplay hasn't suffered one bit

35:24.660 --> 35:27.060
in this new hellscape we find ourselves in.

35:27.060 --> 35:28.980
I'm so proud of you, my brother.

35:28.980 --> 35:30.620
Remembering who I am,

35:30.620 --> 35:33.540
I wrote out that I talk without thinking.

35:33.540 --> 35:35.340
Moving on, it is.

35:37.860 --> 35:39.540
Planet Juggernaut's turn.

35:39.540 --> 35:41.980
So Planet Juggernaut has just seen his Clark

35:43.060 --> 35:45.080
have his head explode.

35:45.080 --> 35:46.180
Yeah, that's a bummer.

35:46.180 --> 35:47.420
Correct, yeah.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.460
Yep.

35:49.460 --> 35:52.660
Yeah, so now Planet Juggernaut is helicoptering

35:52.660 --> 35:55.780
from his tiny little Inspector Gadget helicopter blade,

35:55.780 --> 35:58.480
zooming full speed at Rosemary.

35:58.480 --> 35:59.320
Awesome.

35:59.320 --> 36:03.460
And he's got his big Mickey Mouse gloved hands

36:03.460 --> 36:06.100
extended forward like he's trying to full on

36:06.100 --> 36:07.940
superhero puncher when he gets there.

36:07.940 --> 36:09.500
Go ahead and roll.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.500
You have a 60% in fight.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.980
39.

36:13.980 --> 36:18.300
It is still in the same round as her 75,

36:18.300 --> 36:20.360
which was a pass from earlier.

36:20.360 --> 36:25.360
So two tendrils grab into the luminous land below

36:25.780 --> 36:29.460
and backstroke and dodge nimbly out of the way

36:29.460 --> 36:31.720
as Planet Juggernaut hits the ground

36:31.720 --> 36:34.060
right next to Keith Bishop,

36:34.060 --> 36:37.580
who just landed, shattering the frozen bottom half.

36:37.580 --> 36:38.420
Clark Bishop.

36:38.420 --> 36:39.740
Did I just say Keith Bishop?

36:39.740 --> 36:40.900
Keith Bishop.

36:40.900 --> 36:43.960
Whoa, fun new wrinkle in the story.

36:44.960 --> 36:48.680
If every time we misspoke about character names

36:48.680 --> 36:50.600
had to be included in plot canon,

36:50.600 --> 36:53.340
then this story would be confusing.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.640
Well, we could have a really fun

36:56.640 --> 37:00.040
and incestuous filled like prologue

37:00.040 --> 37:02.320
where the Beans, the Bishops, and the Pennymores

37:02.320 --> 37:05.680
just all get together in like the 1920s.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.660
And we're all, there's just so many secret Beans babies

37:09.660 --> 37:11.060
littered around contention.

37:11.420 --> 37:14.060
It's ready to pop up.

37:14.060 --> 37:16.040
Oh man, Beans babies.

37:17.660 --> 37:19.380
Collectible Beans babies.

37:24.220 --> 37:25.060
Keith Vigna.

37:25.060 --> 37:28.220
Keith Vigna was the person whose name I tried to say.

37:28.220 --> 37:33.220
And now it is the turn of John Lee Kevinmore, the third,

37:33.620 --> 37:36.460
who is face first on the ground,

37:36.460 --> 37:40.180
having just been brought here by Planet Juggernaut.

37:40.180 --> 37:42.760
Very confused by the situation that's at hand.

37:42.760 --> 37:46.180
He was just crushing Wheel of Fortune, not two seconds ago.

37:46.180 --> 37:47.980
He fires his gun into the air.

37:51.980 --> 37:55.740
All right, that is the end of round one

37:55.740 --> 38:00.040
of this other Wild, Wild, Wild Lake combat, Nick Nickles.

38:00.040 --> 38:05.040
And first off, we have this enormous beast to our left,

38:05.760 --> 38:10.680
throws a weird pipe made of light on the inside behind him

38:10.680 --> 38:12.320
and then touches the sky.

38:12.320 --> 38:14.400
Oh, he's gonna testify!

38:14.400 --> 38:19.400
And the sky above turns into an ocean of blackness.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.680
What do you think about that, Nick Nickles?

38:21.680 --> 38:23.280
I'd love to go take a dip in that,

38:23.280 --> 38:25.640
but I do think I would never return to be with you,

38:25.640 --> 38:26.800
my beloved brother.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.840
He looks deeply into your eyes and puts out a hand

38:29.840 --> 38:33.000
that he wants to interlock hands slowly.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.800
Yeah, we do the thing where our fingers match up,

38:35.800 --> 38:36.640
but then-

38:36.640 --> 38:40.000
And then slide off to one side and then interlock.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.520
I would miss you forever and never forgive myself.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.360
I wouldn't forgive myself either.

38:46.400 --> 38:49.160
Rosemary Lunge, the Planet Juggernaut, got sliced in half.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.440
He jumped inside of her.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.960
Keith Beans, one of them jumped down,

38:52.960 --> 38:55.380
froze onto the bottom half, smashed that to bits.

38:55.380 --> 38:57.220
Planet Juggernaut jumped to the side of that.

38:57.220 --> 38:58.480
They're all diving all over the place.

38:58.480 --> 39:00.960
Clark Bishop exploded the back of his head.

39:00.960 --> 39:04.720
Oh my God, he just completely deheaded himself.

39:04.720 --> 39:08.280
What do you think, Nick Nickles?

39:08.280 --> 39:09.120
Deheaded.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.960
There seems to be a lot going on in this combat,

39:14.960 --> 39:16.860
but I can't help but think Clark Bishop

39:16.860 --> 39:19.720
has been an absolute failure, both in the pit

39:19.720 --> 39:22.240
and in this new hell we find ourselves in.

39:22.240 --> 39:25.020
However, we do see another version

39:25.020 --> 39:26.800
of seemingly this same man.

39:26.800 --> 39:30.520
He's dressed in a weird 1970s version

39:30.520 --> 39:33.400
of a contingent police officer uniform,

39:33.400 --> 39:35.680
and this version of Clark Bishop,

39:35.680 --> 39:38.520
oh, light came pouring out of his head

39:38.520 --> 39:41.760
to save an older looking version of himself

39:41.760 --> 39:44.480
from these large creatures,

39:44.480 --> 39:48.240
oh, who seem to resemble our former employer,

39:48.240 --> 39:53.120
who's now locked forever in some sort of weird icicle box

39:53.120 --> 39:55.280
into a lava volcano.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.680
Bobby Glass, they kind of look like him.

39:57.680 --> 39:58.960
What do you think about that?

39:58.960 --> 40:02.160
All I know is all these details are ruining my brain,

40:02.160 --> 40:06.680
but I feel compelled to speak in a sports announcer voice.

40:06.680 --> 40:07.760
Back to you.

40:07.760 --> 40:08.600
Oh my God.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.320
Jesus Christ, what the fuck is this shit?

40:17.200 --> 40:19.160
Hey, do you guys want to play Delta Green?

40:21.280 --> 40:22.120
No.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.760
We could do this other thing though.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.760
The other hand of the Gigantumbropithecus,

40:32.760 --> 40:36.720
shadowy and dripping with ooze and pure darkness,

40:36.720 --> 40:41.720
reaches up and additionally begins to waggle

40:42.880 --> 40:47.880
its long phalanges into the murky water above you.

40:49.480 --> 40:52.480
Two things happen in that moment.

40:52.480 --> 40:57.480
One, the water begins to rise.

40:57.840 --> 41:02.840
It is slowly lowering down toward you all.

41:03.080 --> 41:08.080
And two, multiple unspeakable worm-like abominations

41:08.400 --> 41:13.400
erupt out of the surface of this black, icorous ocean.

41:14.400 --> 41:17.840
These things rise at least 10 feet out of the water,

41:17.840 --> 41:20.960
down toward you, still far away this round,

41:20.960 --> 41:23.440
but seemingly will be moving toward you

41:23.440 --> 41:27.040
with each further round played in this combat.

41:27.040 --> 41:30.680
They're tube-like, they're covered in squamous,

41:30.720 --> 41:33.920
black, partially translucent membranes.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.640
Their bodies are segmented,

41:35.640 --> 41:38.520
toxically green, pulsating arteries and veins

41:38.520 --> 41:41.280
can be seen through their thin looking exterior.

41:41.280 --> 41:44.480
They have no identifiable eyes or nose

41:44.480 --> 41:47.360
and their cavernous, circular mouths,

41:47.360 --> 41:49.960
one sitting just inside the others,

41:49.960 --> 41:52.400
are lined with hooked teeth.

41:52.400 --> 41:56.800
They spit out saliva that's somehow darker than black

41:56.800 --> 42:01.080
and from these maws, these sharp stylets protrude

42:01.080 --> 42:05.640
like something between a tongue and a noodle-like needle.

42:05.640 --> 42:08.120
Does Wheel of Forch John wing one

42:08.120 --> 42:09.520
when he shoots into the air?

42:11.320 --> 42:12.880
Roll.

42:12.880 --> 42:14.040
Firearms.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.040
70 on a 60.

42:17.040 --> 42:19.440
The bullet hits one of these things

42:19.440 --> 42:23.600
and it reacts not at all to the bullet fired

42:23.600 --> 42:26.240
from this Wheel of Forch John.

42:27.800 --> 42:29.360
John Wheel Pettymore.

42:32.840 --> 42:34.680
Rosemary's turn.

42:34.680 --> 42:37.360
Rosemary plugs one of her metal tendrils

42:37.360 --> 42:41.840
into the ground next to her and then goes deeper

42:41.840 --> 42:45.520
and then goes deeper and out in a circle

42:45.520 --> 42:49.760
like a riplets from a drop of water into a puddle.

42:49.760 --> 42:53.000
Those are called riplets because they're small.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.080
These ripples are made of technicolor swirl

42:56.280 --> 43:01.000
that begin to form around and you see a new portal

43:01.000 --> 43:06.000
begin to form around one of these tentacles from Rosemary.

43:07.440 --> 43:09.840
Keith, you are on the phone.

43:11.920 --> 43:15.560
Hmm, this seems unnatural.

43:15.560 --> 43:18.920
Maybe I should listen to it in a different type of way.

43:19.760 --> 43:24.760
Yep, maybe with this passing unnatural role

43:27.760 --> 43:31.120
I will finally understand something.

43:34.840 --> 43:39.840
Hello, Keith Ashley Beans, what can we do for you?

43:40.120 --> 43:41.560
That's a good question.

43:41.560 --> 43:43.960
Hey Don, I got him on the phone.

43:45.120 --> 43:46.760
Yeah, what can you do for me?

43:47.760 --> 43:49.960
Anything you desire.

43:49.960 --> 43:52.320
Hmm, can you get rid of that big thing out there?

43:52.320 --> 43:54.360
We will send reinforcements.

43:54.360 --> 43:57.880
Sweet, can you have him bring me a McFlurry too?

43:57.880 --> 44:00.120
Oreo or M&M. Oreo please.

44:02.320 --> 44:03.360
Don, you want anything?

44:03.360 --> 44:04.200
I'm not in the room.

44:04.200 --> 44:06.000
Get an Oreo and a M&M.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.120
I couldn't tell because it's so dark in here.

44:09.120 --> 44:11.720
Because it's so dark in here.

44:11.720 --> 44:14.120
Hey Don, Don.

44:15.080 --> 44:17.480
Well, how long until they get here?

44:20.360 --> 44:24.120
I put the phone back on the thing.

44:24.120 --> 44:28.280
I put the phone back on the phone and just lay there.

44:30.040 --> 44:31.720
And by laying on the floor,

44:31.720 --> 44:35.920
you've probably done just as much as anyone else has

44:35.920 --> 44:37.280
for the combat hands.

44:41.640 --> 44:44.000
You can't fail if you don't try.

44:44.960 --> 44:49.960
Outside, the last remaining member of Myriad

44:50.760 --> 44:55.760
is going to take on Clarkold once again in a struggle.

44:55.880 --> 44:58.680
Please roll for Clarkold, Joe Terry.

45:00.520 --> 45:02.960
He passed with a 38 on my end.

45:02.960 --> 45:04.440
I rolled a 75.

45:05.440 --> 45:07.560
I don't know what I'm rolling on though.

45:07.560 --> 45:09.200
Oh, Clarkold has 80.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.120
Nice.

45:10.120 --> 45:12.880
So that's a big old success.

45:12.880 --> 45:14.280
Big old success.

45:14.280 --> 45:17.360
Literally this thing reaches out at Clarkold

45:17.360 --> 45:19.440
and Clarkold looks at it

45:19.440 --> 45:24.360
and its hand fucking shrivels back to its elbow.

45:24.360 --> 45:26.800
Its forearm is completely missing

45:26.800 --> 45:30.280
and its suit seemed to be tailored simultaneously

45:30.280 --> 45:31.960
so you can see the effect.

45:33.520 --> 45:34.760
Clark, your turn.

45:34.760 --> 45:36.200
I'm gonna just use this turn

45:36.200 --> 45:38.560
because it seems like Clarkold's got it handled

45:38.560 --> 45:40.560
to yell out to the creature.

45:40.560 --> 45:42.640
What do you want with us, him and me

45:43.640 --> 45:46.080
and we, what do you want with me?

45:46.080 --> 45:48.080
Hello, subject 1522518195518.

45:52.880 --> 45:57.360
Warning, for your own safety, please stay here.

45:57.360 --> 46:00.200
If you choose to disobey this order

46:00.200 --> 46:05.120
and you return to plane 1620216,

46:05.120 --> 46:07.520
you will be eliminated.

46:07.520 --> 46:10.480
We need to stop that thing.

46:10.480 --> 46:12.280
We're not your problem, that's your problem

46:12.800 --> 46:14.920
and I'm pointing at the giant creature.

46:14.920 --> 46:17.440
It makes this similar noise of just this like.

46:17.440 --> 46:18.360
Ah, ah, ah.

46:23.200 --> 46:24.600
Ah, ah, ah.

46:24.600 --> 46:27.400
Yes, I now agree with you.

46:27.400 --> 46:28.720
Oh, fuck yeah, dude.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
I didn't know that was gonna work like that.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.800
It turns and looks at this enormous,

46:38.840 --> 46:40.440
gigantic morpithecus.

46:40.440 --> 46:42.840
Its eyes get really big

46:45.240 --> 46:47.880
and it looks down at its shriveled hand

46:47.880 --> 46:49.800
and then looks down at its other hand

46:49.800 --> 46:50.920
but it already took its turn.

46:50.920 --> 46:52.600
So it's Don D. Pettymore.

46:53.800 --> 46:56.160
I assume Don at this point is,

46:56.160 --> 46:59.080
am I outside of the building observing what happened?

46:59.080 --> 47:03.920
You are looking out on a field of gory glory.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.280
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

47:09.280 --> 47:11.280
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

47:14.280 --> 47:16.080
Wait, do I see John?

47:16.080 --> 47:17.240
Which John, man?

47:17.240 --> 47:18.480
Yeah, you do.

47:18.480 --> 47:20.720
John and original John body.

47:20.720 --> 47:22.320
Do you see one of those?

47:22.320 --> 47:24.800
It's not the same one you were talking to earlier.

47:24.800 --> 47:27.080
That one's a shiny metal ball in the sky.

47:27.080 --> 47:31.520
Yeah, now I'm like, John, John, John

47:31.520 --> 47:34.440
and I'm like yelling at John and running towards him

47:34.440 --> 47:38.560
because I'm curious if me calling the telephone

47:38.560 --> 47:40.840
brought John back to help us

47:40.840 --> 47:42.960
and I'm gonna run directly towards him.

47:42.960 --> 47:44.480
I'm assuming he's decently far away.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.560
I don't know if I have anything else to do, but.

47:46.560 --> 47:47.680
Yeah, he's decently far away

47:47.680 --> 47:48.840
and you have nothing else to do.

47:48.840 --> 47:51.920
Let's go to Keith from the scrap pit.

47:51.920 --> 47:53.360
He's not Jenny from the block.

47:53.360 --> 47:55.680
He's Keith from the scrap pit and it's his turn.

47:55.680 --> 47:57.520
Where have I landed?

47:57.520 --> 47:59.760
Planet Juggernaut is right next to you.

47:59.800 --> 48:03.040
Rosemary's top half with a tendril hanging out

48:03.040 --> 48:06.000
and dug deep into the ground is ahead of you,

48:06.000 --> 48:07.560
about 10 meters.

48:07.560 --> 48:10.600
A portal is opening just to the left of her

48:10.600 --> 48:14.000
and inside of her top half,

48:14.000 --> 48:18.440
you see the writhing tentacles of the ball.

48:18.440 --> 48:22.680
Over to your right, there's a massive liturgy worship

48:22.680 --> 48:24.800
happening of the overseer.

48:24.800 --> 48:28.200
Sha-ka-tee-fa-lee-ya, all for the overseer.

48:28.200 --> 48:31.600
Sha-ka-tee-fa-lee-ya, all for the overseer.

48:31.600 --> 48:34.960
Sha-ka-tee-fa-lee-ya, all for the overseer.

48:34.960 --> 48:38.640
Sha-ka-tee-fa-lee-ya, all for the overseer.

48:38.640 --> 48:40.920
And Clark Bishop is in this group,

48:40.920 --> 48:43.600
not chanting, but still dancing with them

48:43.600 --> 48:48.600
while talking to this translucent gaunt figure

48:49.160 --> 48:50.640
in a black suit.

48:50.640 --> 48:54.400
Keith looks all around him at just the chaos.

48:54.880 --> 48:57.840
He looks straight up and sees those worms.

48:57.840 --> 48:59.280
Fuck those worms.

48:59.280 --> 49:01.520
And he just jumps as high as he can,

49:01.520 --> 49:03.960
trying to get sucked into the gravity

49:03.960 --> 49:06.720
of the plane above him.

49:06.720 --> 49:09.320
Oh shit, oh shit.

49:09.320 --> 49:11.040
He's got those pneumatic legs.

49:11.040 --> 49:16.040
Yeah, I mean, roll dexterity plus 40 for the legs.

49:16.200 --> 49:17.480
Okay, that's a pass.

49:17.480 --> 49:19.600
So I wanna jump as high as I can

49:19.600 --> 49:23.960
and try to get sucked into the gravity of that plane

49:24.480 --> 49:28.080
and once I feel the kind of shift,

49:28.080 --> 49:32.720
I want to try to aim my body right into

49:32.720 --> 49:36.040
one of the mouths of the worms

49:36.040 --> 49:38.520
and just unload my freeze gun

49:38.520 --> 49:43.520
as I slide into the open mouth of one of the worms.

49:43.640 --> 49:47.400
Why, why, what?

49:47.400 --> 49:49.440
I'm gonna freeze him from the inside out

49:49.440 --> 49:51.000
and bust my way out of there.

49:54.960 --> 49:58.200
Or get stuck in a frozen worm as it collapses to earth.

49:59.200 --> 50:00.040
Either way.

50:04.560 --> 50:08.200
Okay, roll firearms for the gun.

50:08.200 --> 50:10.800
17, that's a pass.

50:10.800 --> 50:13.360
The mouths inside of this,

50:13.360 --> 50:18.360
you've got multiple round mouths of teeth spinning around.

50:19.320 --> 50:21.240
It completely freezes up.

50:21.240 --> 50:22.880
I mean, it's exactly as you said,

50:22.880 --> 50:25.320
you go feet first down into this thing.

50:28.800 --> 50:33.800
Elsa, Jonah heads directly into the enormous xenonematode.

50:36.840 --> 50:37.680
Yee-haw.

50:39.680 --> 50:42.240
Yee-haw indeed, Clark Bishop,

50:42.240 --> 50:44.160
it would be one of your turns,

50:44.160 --> 50:47.200
but okay, with this turn,

50:47.800 --> 50:52.800
the legs that were up in the air fall down,

50:56.400 --> 50:58.720
like on the other side, like forward,

50:58.720 --> 51:01.520
and so his legs kind of go over where his head would be

51:01.520 --> 51:04.560
and then land on the ground, boots first.

51:05.440 --> 51:07.920
Planet Juggernaut, Europe.

51:07.920 --> 51:10.240
Planet Juggernaut is eerily still,

51:10.240 --> 51:12.480
and you hear worrying from inside of him.

51:12.480 --> 51:15.720
Oh shit, oh shit.

51:16.680 --> 51:17.960
The plan has begun.

51:17.960 --> 51:19.200
Wheel of forts, Jon.

51:19.200 --> 51:21.520
Jon wheel petty more.

51:21.520 --> 51:24.760
Have we skipped first Jon?

51:24.760 --> 51:29.000
Yes, sorry, we did.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.200
First Jon is a ball.

51:30.200 --> 51:31.440
Jon, you are a ball.

51:31.440 --> 51:35.400
You are inside the top half of Rosemary's body.

51:35.400 --> 51:36.240
What do you do?

51:36.240 --> 51:38.680
Jon starts reaching his tendrils out

51:38.680 --> 51:42.400
to the ball that's floating right above Rosemary's head,

51:42.400 --> 51:44.920
and I wanna start to try to merge with it.

51:44.960 --> 51:45.880
Roll a natural.

51:48.120 --> 51:50.240
94, fail.

51:52.240 --> 51:54.080
Pass, 68.

51:55.320 --> 51:58.360
Like magnets, different poles.

51:58.360 --> 52:00.880
You just bounce off this thing.

52:00.880 --> 52:05.880
You can't enter even within the six inches nearest to it.

52:06.120 --> 52:10.080
Something just like pulls you away, pulls you away.

52:10.080 --> 52:14.000
Cool idea, very, very intrigued by that idea.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.880
So Jon wheel petty more,

52:15.880 --> 52:20.360
you see a long lost member of your family.

52:20.360 --> 52:25.360
You haven't seen him in years, and he's running toward you.

52:25.480 --> 52:28.760
Jon points his gun at Uncle Don and screams,

52:28.760 --> 52:30.800
you stop right there, you son of a bitch.

52:30.800 --> 52:32.240
Not one step further.

52:32.240 --> 52:34.960
Don stops in his tracks, and he's like,

52:34.960 --> 52:37.200
you're gonna talk to your uncle like that, boy?

52:37.200 --> 52:39.280
What the fuck are you doing here, Uncle Don?

52:39.280 --> 52:41.360
Why are you pointing a goddamn gun at me?

52:41.360 --> 52:42.680
What is here?

52:42.680 --> 52:44.400
Where the fuck are we?

52:44.400 --> 52:49.400
Jon, I think that it's maybe too long of a story right now

52:49.880 --> 52:53.280
for all of this, and he like,

52:53.280 --> 52:57.120
what is the meme, gestures towards everything, like.

52:57.120 --> 53:00.760
Jon looks over his shoulder and like looks at the nematodes,

53:00.760 --> 53:02.760
the Xena nematodes falling from the sky,

53:02.760 --> 53:06.040
and the giant kaijus.

53:06.040 --> 53:08.200
He nods to Don and he says,

53:08.200 --> 53:10.120
I reckon you might have a point,

53:10.120 --> 53:12.160
and he lowers his pistol.

53:12.920 --> 53:15.160
I think I brought you back here.

53:15.160 --> 53:18.320
There is a phone, I threw it in a bag at one point,

53:18.320 --> 53:20.880
and I thought it was supposed to help everything,

53:20.880 --> 53:23.280
maybe it was gonna heal stuff, I don't know,

53:23.280 --> 53:27.440
but I think you're here, maybe you can,

53:27.440 --> 53:30.320
maybe you're what I asked for.

53:30.320 --> 53:34.280
Maybe, I got brought here by a giant robot ball.

53:34.280 --> 53:36.080
That seems a lot more helpful,

53:36.080 --> 53:37.720
maybe that's what you asked for.

53:37.720 --> 53:40.600
Maybe the phone works in mysterious ways.

53:42.320 --> 53:47.320
The phone, is that like an old Hebrew name for the Lord?

53:53.000 --> 53:58.000
It's a phone, it's a phone, like an old time telephone.

53:59.440 --> 54:00.480
Uncle Don?

54:00.480 --> 54:01.920
Yeah boy, what?

54:01.920 --> 54:03.600
What do we do?

54:03.600 --> 54:06.920
I'm not sure, I came here,

54:06.920 --> 54:10.720
I was with you, but you were my brother,

54:10.720 --> 54:14.160
but you said you was ball, but now you're you.

54:14.160 --> 54:16.840
I don't know boy, I feel like I've lost my mind,

54:16.840 --> 54:21.760
I don't know what's happening, what's real, and what's not,

54:21.760 --> 54:24.920
but maybe you can help me, and I can,

54:26.400 --> 54:28.600
he gets completely lost in a train of thought

54:28.600 --> 54:30.200
that kind of goes nowhere.

54:30.200 --> 54:33.320
When he says that you're ball,

54:33.320 --> 54:37.000
this John has taken a moment to realize where he is

54:37.000 --> 54:39.720
and what's going on, and he sees the other balls,

54:39.720 --> 54:41.880
he sees Planet Juggernaut,

54:41.880 --> 54:44.360
some tendrils start poking out of his back,

54:44.360 --> 54:48.000
and one of them pats Uncle Don on the shoulder reassuringly.

54:55.880 --> 54:57.560
He freezes up at first.

54:57.560 --> 54:59.000
Yes, the metal is quite cool.

55:02.360 --> 55:05.640
Damn, were you always ball?

55:05.640 --> 55:08.640
Yes, I am a John of fortune.

55:09.720 --> 55:11.240
Pfft.

55:39.720 --> 55:44.720
What kind of world are you livin' in?

55:48.400 --> 55:53.400
What kind of world are you livin' in?

56:10.400 --> 56:15.400
What kind of world are you livin' in?

56:18.680 --> 56:23.680
What kind of world are you livin' in?
