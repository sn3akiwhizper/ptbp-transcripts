00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
Due to a very special guest, we may have us some first-time listeners.

00:06.800 --> 00:12.480
And those first-time listeners might be worried that this is the ninth episode of the second

00:12.480 --> 00:13.480
season.

00:13.480 --> 00:18.960
But I assure you, first-time listener, you are in the right place.

00:18.960 --> 00:23.980
You do not need any prior knowledge to listen to this episode.

00:23.980 --> 00:28.240
This is the first of a four-episode prequel story.

00:28.240 --> 00:34.440
It was actually recorded before anything else for season two, and season two is not

00:34.440 --> 00:37.000
a continuation of season one.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.600
So no need to worry about those 115 episodes for now.

00:42.600 --> 00:50.080
Just sit back, relax, and enjoy how nervous Zach is, while Beth May from Dungeons & Daddies

00:50.080 --> 00:53.000
gets on our audio show.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.600
Let's go to the intro.

00:56.600 --> 01:01.520
Welcome, listeners, new and old, bashful and bold.

01:01.520 --> 01:06.320
All are welcome in Mother Wolf's warm and damp embrace.

01:06.320 --> 01:16.120
For I am Wolf the Dog, and I am cherishing you all live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio

01:16.120 --> 01:24.880
station that exists here in August 20th, 1694, the Golden Age of Piracy.

01:24.880 --> 01:30.440
You know we got it locked down here in the greater Antilles.

01:30.440 --> 01:34.480
Sometimes we get fan mail, and sometimes I read it.

01:34.480 --> 01:39.120
And by sometimes, I mean, like, every episode.

01:39.120 --> 01:42.280
It's time for a new Howlin' with Wolf, baby.

01:42.280 --> 01:48.540
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Eula in Bochum, Germany, who tagged that pretending

01:48.540 --> 01:54.480
pod in an Instagram story, an Uber guile thing to do.

01:54.480 --> 02:02.060
Eula writes, please give this message to Klara and Robin, who hate things like this.

02:02.060 --> 02:07.720
Without you, the world turns black and white, because your eyes take the color with them

02:07.720 --> 02:09.280
when you leave.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.280
Happy birthday.

02:10.280 --> 02:17.140
Look at me keeping a secret, and give a kiss to Luisa, who is responsible for all three

02:17.140 --> 02:19.160
of us listening to this show.

02:19.160 --> 02:22.460
I hope I'm making tea for you right now.

02:22.460 --> 02:26.180
As we say in Germany, brÃ¼der muss los.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.100
Thank you, Eula.

02:28.100 --> 02:33.400
This writing you wrote makes me feel happy, for the people in your life.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.400
It's great.

02:34.400 --> 02:41.380
But, um, can't help but notice you didn't really say anything about me, Wolf, the dog,

02:41.380 --> 02:46.520
in this wonderful letter, but I'm definitely okay with the fact that I wasn't mentioned

02:46.520 --> 02:49.880
a single time during this entire letter.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.860
It doesn't bother me one bit.

02:51.860 --> 02:57.800
I definitely am not going to cry into my pillow tonight when thinking about this wonderful

02:57.800 --> 03:02.700
fan mail where my name is not uttered in a singular instance.

03:02.700 --> 03:07.140
If you want to write up something for your mother, Wolf the Hal, tag at PretendingPod

03:07.140 --> 03:13.220
on Twitter or Instagram, tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook, or write up a five-star review

03:13.220 --> 03:17.720
on your podcast app of choice, and send us that receipt.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.800
If you tell your friends about the show, I'll say pretty much whatever you want me

03:21.800 --> 03:22.800
to say.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.520
That's how this works, my babies.

03:25.520 --> 03:32.540
If you want to shoot the shit with other listeners of this fine show, join our Discord and subreddit.

03:32.540 --> 03:38.320
If you want to see pictures of our faces and sick fan art, follow us at PretendingPod.

03:38.320 --> 03:44.660
If you want to give us money, we'll give you bonus episodes and or merchandise.

03:44.660 --> 03:51.220
If you want to find links to all that slop and more, the links are in the show notes.

03:51.220 --> 03:55.220
Click them, you goblin, and get your peepers perusing.

03:55.220 --> 03:56.940
Got a pirate problem?

03:56.940 --> 04:00.180
I be the modern solution.

04:00.180 --> 04:01.180
Time to gyrate.

04:01.180 --> 04:02.620
It's R.I.

04:02.620 --> 04:03.620
P.E.T.E.R.

04:03.620 --> 04:04.620
with Cruisin'!

04:32.620 --> 04:49.220
Welcome, everyone.

04:49.220 --> 04:53.700
We are doing another short story here with PretendingToBePeople.

04:53.700 --> 04:54.700
I'm really excited.

04:54.700 --> 04:55.700
Joe, are you excited?

04:55.700 --> 04:56.700
I am so excited.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.820
Thomas, how do you feel right now?

04:58.820 --> 04:59.820
I'm pretty stoked.

04:59.820 --> 05:03.620
We've got one of our favorite role-playing podcasters.

05:03.620 --> 05:05.100
She's a playwright.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.140
She's a screenwriter.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.400
She's a poet.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.820
She's a comedian.

05:09.820 --> 05:15.340
She's Ron Stampler and Scary Marlowe on my personal favorite actual play podcast, Dungeons

05:15.340 --> 05:16.340
and Daddies.

05:16.340 --> 05:17.340
It's Beth May!

05:17.340 --> 05:18.340
It's Beth May.

05:18.340 --> 05:22.340
Beth May's at the house.

05:22.340 --> 05:25.340
Oh my gosh, what an intro.

05:25.340 --> 05:26.340
Wow.

05:26.340 --> 05:28.060
Welcome to PretendingToBePeople.

05:28.060 --> 05:33.480
It came off of 30 seconds of deeply serious room noise where you guys are like, we need

05:33.480 --> 05:38.660
30 seconds of silence for, and I thought you were about to say the name of a departed friend

05:38.660 --> 05:45.060
or loved one, and I was getting ready for it, but no, to come from the energy of silence

05:45.060 --> 05:48.860
into that lovely intro was so wonderful and welcoming.

05:48.860 --> 05:50.260
Thank you for having me here.

05:50.260 --> 05:51.780
Thank you so much for being here.

05:51.780 --> 05:53.180
Why are you on our show?

05:53.180 --> 05:54.180
Yeah.

05:54.500 --> 06:00.260
Do you actually want to know something like really funny that is funny?

06:00.260 --> 06:01.940
Are you laughing with us or at us?

06:01.940 --> 06:02.940
Kind of like both.

06:02.940 --> 06:05.260
I'm so sorry, but I did.

06:05.260 --> 06:09.620
I did agree to come on the show because I thought that you were a friend of my friend

06:09.620 --> 06:17.740
and then I found out that you weren't, but then you seemed chill, so it was all okay.

06:17.740 --> 06:19.660
Beth, our podcast is actually good.

06:19.660 --> 06:20.660
You're so lucky.

06:20.660 --> 06:21.660
I know.

06:21.660 --> 06:22.660
I feel lucky.

06:22.660 --> 06:26.980
Yeah, I feel like I really lucked out.

06:26.980 --> 06:29.580
That's kind of rare in the role playing podcast world.

06:29.580 --> 06:32.580
Should we shout out that podcast that you thought you were coming on?

06:32.580 --> 06:37.780
No, I just literally thought that one of my friends knew you for some reason, and then

06:37.780 --> 06:42.820
I was like, Travis, I'm going on your friend's podcast, and he's like, what, I've never heard

06:42.820 --> 06:43.820
of that.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.820
He's like, who the fuck is that?

06:44.820 --> 06:47.060
Zach has a good friend named Travis.

06:47.060 --> 06:48.060
I do.

06:48.060 --> 06:49.060
There's more overlap.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.060
They must pretend.

06:50.060 --> 06:51.060
Yeah.

06:51.060 --> 06:52.060
That's exactly what we do.

06:52.460 --> 06:54.460
That's the whole point of the show.

06:54.460 --> 06:56.180
Zach, you never asked Luke how he felt.

06:56.180 --> 06:57.180
Luke, are your socks wet?

06:57.180 --> 06:58.180
Are my socks wet?

06:58.180 --> 07:00.780
How do you feel about having Beth on the show?

07:00.780 --> 07:02.780
Neutral plus, I would say.

07:02.780 --> 07:03.780
Okay.

07:03.780 --> 07:05.540
He just started listening to the day, Beth.

07:05.540 --> 07:06.540
I'm sorry.

07:06.540 --> 07:07.540
He doesn't really know.

07:07.540 --> 07:08.540
No, I totally understand.

07:08.540 --> 07:11.980
No, I'm stoked because I know a lot of people listen to you, so that's good for me.

07:11.980 --> 07:12.980
Yeah.

07:12.980 --> 07:15.940
He thought that it was a friend of his that was coming on the show.

07:15.940 --> 07:16.940
I love Beth.

07:16.940 --> 07:19.300
She's great.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.300
And then you showed up.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.300
I was like, wait.

07:21.540 --> 07:22.540
Oh, damn.

07:22.540 --> 07:25.540
Luke, she's really good.

07:25.540 --> 07:26.540
It's chill.

07:26.540 --> 07:27.540
I don't know why you're saying really good.

07:27.540 --> 07:31.620
I'm like notoriously the worst D&D role player actually ever.

07:31.620 --> 07:33.540
I can't believe you guys wanted me on here.

07:33.540 --> 07:34.540
No, no, no.

07:34.540 --> 07:35.540
We don't.

07:35.540 --> 07:36.540
That works out really well.

07:36.540 --> 07:37.540
We don't play D&D.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.540
We don't play D&D at all.

07:38.540 --> 07:39.540
We also don't play the game we play either.

07:39.540 --> 07:40.540
Okay.

07:40.540 --> 07:41.540
That's fabulous.

07:41.540 --> 07:43.220
It's like Whose Line, Delta Green.

07:43.220 --> 07:48.540
It's exactly like Whose Line, literally in that we're going to play some improv games.

07:48.780 --> 07:50.780
A very tall man named Colin Mockery.

07:50.780 --> 07:51.780
Ryan Stiles.

07:51.780 --> 07:52.780
Oh, right.

07:52.780 --> 07:56.780
You're making a Colin Mockery of us by not knowing Ryan Stiles' name right now, Tom.

07:56.780 --> 08:00.780
I feel like Colin is tall for some people.

08:00.780 --> 08:01.780
He is tall for some people.

08:01.780 --> 08:02.780
Well, for some people.

08:02.780 --> 08:03.780
That's true.

08:03.780 --> 08:05.780
He's tall for me, but not for Ryan Stiles.

08:05.780 --> 08:06.780
That's great.

08:06.780 --> 08:07.780
Wow.

08:07.780 --> 08:08.780
Zach, what do we do today?

08:08.780 --> 08:09.780
Thanks, Joe.

08:09.780 --> 08:10.780
I appreciate you asking that.

08:10.780 --> 08:11.780
Well, I'm going to just go ahead.

08:11.780 --> 08:12.780
Wait, wait, Zach.

08:12.780 --> 08:13.780
What are we doing today?

08:13.780 --> 08:14.780
Oh, yeah.

08:14.780 --> 08:15.780
That was good.

08:15.780 --> 08:16.780
I'm excited.

08:17.020 --> 08:20.020
Thank you, legendary podcaster Beth May.

08:23.020 --> 08:24.020
She hasn't left the Zoom call yet.

08:24.020 --> 08:29.820
I sent you guys a message that said that your ship's crew has been invited to interview

08:29.820 --> 08:31.740
for a mysterious job.

08:31.740 --> 08:32.740
Our ship's crew?

08:32.740 --> 08:33.740
Your ship's crew.

08:33.740 --> 08:34.740
Because?

08:34.740 --> 08:36.740
Because you four are?

08:36.740 --> 08:37.740
Are?

08:37.740 --> 08:38.740
Pirates.

08:38.740 --> 08:39.740
Seamen.

08:39.740 --> 08:40.740
Salesfolk?

08:40.740 --> 08:43.980
You're on the high waters on the seas.

08:43.980 --> 08:44.980
Your salesman.

08:44.980 --> 08:45.980
Salesman, yeah.

08:46.180 --> 08:47.180
Is that the name of the boat?

08:47.180 --> 08:48.180
The Death of a Salesman?

08:48.180 --> 08:49.180
The Death of a Salesman.

08:49.180 --> 08:50.180
I love it.

08:50.180 --> 08:51.180
Salesman.

08:51.180 --> 08:52.180
That's way funnier than what you pitched in this part.

08:52.180 --> 08:53.180
Oh, my God.

08:53.180 --> 08:54.180
Sales.

08:54.180 --> 08:55.180
Like, sale.

08:55.180 --> 08:56.180
Oh, my God.

08:56.180 --> 08:57.180
Oh, my God.

08:57.180 --> 08:58.180
Sale.

08:58.180 --> 09:04.620
First, you must sail to an unnamed island northeast of the Antaeus Maoris in the North

09:04.620 --> 09:06.340
Atlantic Ocean.

09:06.340 --> 09:12.660
You will then compete with five other seafaring crews in a bizarre interview of sorts for

09:12.660 --> 09:18.540
the chance to win a job that claims to pay enough gold to comfortably live off for the

09:18.540 --> 09:20.540
rest of your lives.

09:20.540 --> 09:23.740
Hi, my name is Jorgen Stick.

09:23.740 --> 09:25.660
Thank you for coming on the boat today.

09:25.660 --> 09:30.640
Welcome to my crib.

09:30.640 --> 09:35.520
We are here on the what's currently known as the Silent Doom, but oh, no, it actually

09:35.520 --> 09:36.520
just changed.

09:36.520 --> 09:39.820
At the last meeting, it's called the Death of a Salesman.

09:39.820 --> 09:40.820
We all voted.

09:40.820 --> 09:50.400
We have a democracy here aboard the Death of a Salesman and welcome to Caribs, the Caribbean

09:50.400 --> 09:54.980
version of Caribs, and welcome to PTBP, Caribs.

09:54.980 --> 09:56.560
This is the Death of a Salesman.

09:56.560 --> 10:00.660
We're going to show you around who would be on the main deck right off the bat.

10:00.660 --> 10:02.180
Wavy Adler.

10:02.180 --> 10:03.540
It's Waverly Adler.

10:03.540 --> 10:05.480
He goes by Wavy.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.880
Is the camera crew now pointed at me?

10:07.880 --> 10:11.200
The camera crew is directly pointed at you and Jorgen is just kind of like showing you

10:11.200 --> 10:12.640
off like Vanna White.

10:12.640 --> 10:16.740
He has a spyglass ad and he's looking out to the horizon and he notices that he's now

10:16.740 --> 10:18.480
the center of some attention.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.120
Oh, hey.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.200
Oh, hey, didn't notice you there.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.200
Didn't see you there.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.320
Oh, hey there, Jorgen.

10:26.320 --> 10:27.320
Can I help you with something?

10:27.320 --> 10:28.320
Oh, yes.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.040
No, I was just showing people around the ship.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.200
Oh, we got a bit of a change here.

10:32.200 --> 10:37.320
Yeah, I was just showing people around the Death of a Salesman and I was hoping that

10:37.320 --> 10:39.040
you could just tell them what you do around here.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.040
Oh, here.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.040
Sure, of course.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.660
And he kind of straightens out his jacket that's kind of tattered.

10:43.660 --> 10:48.800
It was nice at one time, but it's old now and rumpled and licks his hand and puts it

10:48.800 --> 10:50.040
through his hair real quick.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.940
Well, here is the main deck.

10:51.940 --> 10:55.640
That's the steering wheel over there and I kind of stand here and look out the edge there

10:55.640 --> 10:57.600
and make sure we don't hit anything.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.840
And then people come up to me and they ask me questions about things and I try and set

11:00.840 --> 11:01.840
them on the right direction.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.280
It's usually the direction the wind blows.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.280
That's the secret.

11:06.240 --> 11:11.240
I on a sailing ship it often is creeping right from behind a mass that's like right behind

11:11.240 --> 11:12.240
you comes.

11:12.240 --> 11:16.500
Oh, and me Christian name is Edward Spitz, but if you're on me ship and you know what's

11:16.500 --> 11:19.640
good for you, you call me Mr. Spitz.

11:19.640 --> 11:20.640
Mr. Spitz.

11:20.640 --> 11:21.640
That's Mr. Spitz there.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.640
Hello, wifey.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.640
Jurgen's showing somebody around the boat.

11:24.640 --> 11:28.440
Jurgen's got a camera crew.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.640
Mr. Spitz, I was just hoping that, oh, I'm leaning right into it.

11:31.640 --> 11:32.640
Oh, Mr. Spitz.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
I was hoping that you could show the dear people around.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Oh, yes.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I've always been Irish ever since the beginning.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.480
Oh, from the top of the bottom to the bottom of the top, I've been Irish and I'm hoping

11:41.480 --> 11:43.200
that you'll tell people what you do on the ship.

11:43.200 --> 11:48.240
I thought he was vaguely Scandinavian, but what I do on the ship, I do everything on

11:48.240 --> 11:49.240
his ship.

11:49.240 --> 11:52.720
I'll make sure this gross tub has an Irish civility.

11:52.720 --> 11:55.920
You see, I sort of the food.

11:55.920 --> 11:58.120
There we go.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.320
We got to the final answer there.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.960
Oh, but I don't do it like no typical pirate scowl, you know, I bring some class to it.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.800
No, he does it up real nice, doesn't he?

12:08.800 --> 12:11.880
Plus I can read, which is more than I can say for any of you.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.400
The tines on our forks, sometimes there's three of them.

12:14.400 --> 12:18.840
Yeah, often there is three tines instead of two.

12:18.840 --> 12:22.040
And Geneva had that before Edward Spitz was on board.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.040
Never.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.040
That's right.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.320
Things really started looking up around here when you joined us.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.000
Mr. Spitz brought you three tines.

12:28.000 --> 12:36.720
And then we, uh, we hear, uh, the wood slapping wood and a stumble emotion as Beth knows what

12:36.720 --> 12:40.120
she, what she must do now.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.800
Hey, what's going on up here?

12:42.800 --> 12:50.080
Dr. Shark, uh, just showing everyone around the ship and, and, and what it's me, Dr. Shark.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.800
Hello, Dr. Shark.

12:51.800 --> 12:52.800
Hey there, doc.

12:52.800 --> 12:53.800
Hi, doctor.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.760
Anybody, uh, sick or anything?

12:56.760 --> 13:05.200
I mean, just the typical worms and malaria, but as she asked, or as he asked the, a door

13:05.200 --> 13:12.840
flies open and alabaster, Chernabog projectile vomits, and you see this pale skinned, like

13:12.840 --> 13:17.560
long greasy, dark hair, open sores all over his face.

13:17.560 --> 13:21.680
Um, his shirt is white and it's just blood and pus.

13:21.680 --> 13:22.680
Just soaked.

13:22.680 --> 13:31.960
And the camera freezes on you and then whip pans back around to Beth May, our guest.

13:31.960 --> 13:36.400
And uh, and we get a good description of what her character looks like.

13:36.400 --> 13:42.120
Well, he says, I'm sick as soon as she says, he says that,

13:42.120 --> 13:45.560
Oh, Dr. Shark looks like Tony Soprano.

13:45.560 --> 13:53.120
Um, and um, but like in like more twenties garb, I know that we're supposed to be in

13:53.120 --> 13:54.760
like the 1800s or whatever.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.120
I said a year earlier.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.760
I don't remember what it was.

13:58.760 --> 14:03.400
You said like in a mobster suit or whatever, and I pictured you in a huge oversized zoot

14:03.400 --> 14:04.400
suit.

14:04.400 --> 14:12.440
Yes, that, but like physically Tony Soprano inside the suit, but, uh, Dr. Shark only has

14:12.440 --> 14:13.440
peg legs.

14:13.640 --> 14:16.640
No, no, no biological legs there.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.640
What sound does that make on the deck?

14:18.640 --> 14:22.840
It makes a real like sexy sound, which you wouldn't think, right?

14:22.840 --> 14:26.560
But it makes like, that makes me horny.

14:26.560 --> 14:34.200
Just one clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.200
It's a real jazzy clunk.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.640
I know what the four of us are doing after this recording.

14:38.640 --> 14:41.240
Yeah, jerking it to the clunk clunk.

14:42.240 --> 14:45.440
No, you don't know how this podcast is run.

14:45.440 --> 14:51.040
He's going to make us stay in this room and make wood noises until we tap on wood in the

14:51.040 --> 14:52.040
perfect way.

14:52.040 --> 14:55.640
Until I finally get poley erect based on your wood.

14:55.640 --> 14:56.640
Yeah.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.640
He's like, that's not quite my speed.

14:58.640 --> 15:04.440
Um, and that's how Zach gets wood racking.

15:04.440 --> 15:07.120
I was clunking, I don't know.

15:07.120 --> 15:13.240
And then, uh, Dr. Shark is accompanied always, uh, his permanent, his permanent companion,

15:13.240 --> 15:18.320
a parrot on his shoulder, Mrs. Knife and Mrs. Knife just squawks.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.320
Mrs. Knife.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.040
Oh damn, that was good.

15:22.040 --> 15:26.800
I'm going to use that exact audio for all birds in season two.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.800
There you go.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.000
This will be a bird-centric season.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.880
There's going to be so many birds.

15:30.880 --> 15:34.840
We actually haven't started recording season two, but I just put a bunch of birds into

15:34.840 --> 15:37.520
it in my head.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.520
So what is it?

15:38.520 --> 15:40.040
What is Dr. Shark's face?

15:40.040 --> 15:42.040
Like what do we learn from his face?

15:42.040 --> 15:51.320
What does his face betray exactly when, when, uh, when Al, when Al busts through the door

15:51.320 --> 15:55.160
with a, with a heave and a, in a wet, wet mouth.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.280
Oh, well, I think he's seen this all before.

15:58.280 --> 16:03.840
I think he says something like, Al, I said, if it is anybody's sick, that is anybody,

16:03.840 --> 16:12.360
you know, Al, like, you know, Al sadly, sadly looks up understanding having heard this

16:12.360 --> 16:13.680
many times before.

16:13.680 --> 16:16.760
I mean, I could pop up the hood and give it a look.

16:16.760 --> 16:17.760
You know what I mean?

16:17.760 --> 16:23.740
Al has heard this before and vehemently shakes his head no.

16:23.740 --> 16:29.280
In the age of sale that meant like opening up your rib cage and peeking inside.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.640
We get a real good face shot of Jurgen's stick here.

16:32.640 --> 16:33.640
He's got brown.

16:33.640 --> 16:34.640
Does he do a gym take?

16:34.640 --> 16:36.160
Uh, yo total gym.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.160
Oh my gosh.

16:37.160 --> 16:43.920
As, as the, uh, as the whole classic interaction between Dr. Shark and alabaster Al, uh, is

16:43.920 --> 16:47.120
going down like it does every Tuesday.

16:47.120 --> 16:52.320
You're going to stick Jim's the fuck out of the camera with his brown chin length hair

16:52.320 --> 16:59.720
parted in the middle, short goatee, early thirties with his early thirties brought to

16:59.720 --> 17:04.560
us by patron modern cannabis from grand junction, Colorado.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.560
Thank you.

17:05.560 --> 17:08.620
Modern cannabis for Jurgen stick.

17:08.620 --> 17:11.700
He's whimsically joyous when he shouldn't be.

17:11.700 --> 17:18.320
So he, uh, he does a quick little jig in the, in the yak that, uh, the alabaster Alice

17:18.320 --> 17:20.040
sicked up onto deck.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.440
I think that, uh, that, that about does it for the shift, doesn't it?

17:23.440 --> 17:27.960
Uh, did we meet everyone and you see an entire like massive crew of pirates?

17:27.960 --> 17:28.960
Yeah.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.200
We probably met everyone.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.200
Right.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.200
He met everybody who matters.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.200
That's certain.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.200
What was that?

17:34.200 --> 17:35.200
Patron's name?

17:35.200 --> 17:36.200
Modern cannabis.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.200
Modern cannabis.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.320
Uh, my mom lives in Western Colorado, so next time I'm out in junction, if you want to smoke

17:40.320 --> 17:44.800
me up, that would be rad.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.680
There's one last person that we need to meet.

17:46.680 --> 17:47.680
Oh yeah.

17:47.680 --> 17:48.680
That makes sense.

17:48.680 --> 17:55.200
And that is the emperor Tamarind monkey that is currently eating alabaster's puke, which

17:55.200 --> 18:00.280
is the only reason Mr. Spitz is not like screaming at you because he knows it's going to get

18:00.280 --> 18:01.280
cleaned up.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.280
Yeah.

18:02.280 --> 18:09.240
I know your monkey will eat your mess.

18:09.240 --> 18:14.760
And yeah, up to this point, alabaster was only just given like sad nods and he wants

18:14.760 --> 18:19.320
more sad nods at you while he watches his monkey clean his mess up.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.320
The name of the monkey?

18:20.320 --> 18:23.640
If we don't know yet, because I don't know yet.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.360
And uh, does anyone have an extra writing utensil?

18:26.360 --> 18:27.360
Oh yeah.

18:27.360 --> 18:28.360
Oh yeah.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.400
That's what I needed right there.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.000
I needed to write down your character names.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.440
It's super handy for a GM.

18:35.440 --> 18:36.440
That's a little pro tip.

18:36.440 --> 18:37.440
A pen?

18:37.440 --> 18:41.000
A pen is a great tool for anyone in your life.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
And really anyone.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Yeah.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Wait.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Thomas, what's your name?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Edward Spitz or Mr. Spitz?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Mr. Spitz.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
I love that.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Thank you, Beth May.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah, that's good.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.280
Joe, what's your character name?

18:52.280 --> 18:53.280
Wavy Adler.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.280
Duh.

18:54.280 --> 18:58.080
I'm so sorry that I had to ask after you spent the time to create that.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.920
Wait, Luke, what was your name?

18:59.920 --> 19:01.880
My name is Alabaster.

19:01.880 --> 19:08.760
You can call me Al Chernabog and my monkey that will get named later.

19:08.760 --> 19:11.240
I love the promise of a premise.

19:11.240 --> 19:15.320
Like fucking that monkey is going to get named later.

19:15.320 --> 19:19.400
Alabaster has told him multiple times, when you prove yourself, you get a name.

19:19.400 --> 19:23.040
Yeah, that monkey has to kill.

19:23.040 --> 19:27.440
And then it takes the name of the first man it kills.

19:27.440 --> 19:32.820
You guys head out past the islands that make up the Antis Maerus.

19:32.820 --> 19:34.440
You can just say Greater Antilles.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.440
What is it?

19:35.440 --> 19:36.440
Greater Antilles.

19:36.440 --> 19:37.440
Greater Antilles.

19:37.440 --> 19:38.440
Mm-hmm.

19:38.440 --> 19:39.440
Philly.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.440
All right, my bad.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.640
You can just say Labia Majora.

19:43.640 --> 19:48.880
If you sail past the Labia Majora and into the Labia Minora, which basically all I was

19:48.880 --> 19:57.200
getting to during this is, we're going to fast forward into a dark night.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.000
Most nights are pretty dark, Zach.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.720
There is no moonlight on this night.

20:01.720 --> 20:04.000
You can't see the hand in front of your face.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.680
Well, can't do surgery tonight.

20:05.680 --> 20:09.240
Can't see the hand in front of my face, so.

20:09.240 --> 20:12.240
Oh, darker shock is our commission tonight.

20:12.240 --> 20:18.440
Will you please, please, I need my leg taken off right now or I'll lose my everything.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Could you stop bleeding on my dicks?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
I can't, I don't know where.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
I can't see the blood.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.440
Darker shock can operate in the morning.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.240
Yeah, sorry, matey.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.240
I'm going to wait for the morning.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.240
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.240
I'll bring up some candles.

20:30.240 --> 20:31.240
Oh, that'd be great.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.240
Oh, okay.

20:32.240 --> 20:33.240
All right, yeah.

20:33.240 --> 20:34.240
Oh, okay.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.960
Oh, official law.

20:35.960 --> 20:36.960
And as some light-

20:36.960 --> 20:37.960
Modern wonders.

20:37.960 --> 20:42.440
As some light gets in there, you see Jurgen's stick is just up against the wall of this

20:42.440 --> 20:47.960
small cabin and he's just bleeding profusely from his kneecap.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.480
I just tripped down the stairs.

20:50.480 --> 20:56.120
There's a bone sticking up out of his knee as the candle finally makes its way up above

20:56.120 --> 21:02.480
and he looks right into the eyes of Dr. Shark and he's like, I just need, I just need.

21:02.480 --> 21:06.360
Well, let me, let me console my nurse here.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.120
What do you think we should do, Mrs. Knife?

21:09.120 --> 21:12.520
Cut it off.

21:12.520 --> 21:15.520
I think we got to cut it off, so.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.080
Mrs. Knife never lies.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.080
Mrs. Knife never lies.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.080
Mrs. Knife never lies.

21:22.080 --> 21:26.080
And Dr. Shark takes a big, what do they use?

21:26.080 --> 21:27.080
Like, saws?

21:27.080 --> 21:29.080
No, saws are pretty slow.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.080
Well, they're like big surgical saws.

21:31.080 --> 21:37.080
We just watched Master and Commander to get in the mood for this.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.080
Yeah, and you have a little cork to chew on.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.080
I'll give you a little cork to chew on.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.080
They're literally called bone saws.

21:43.640 --> 21:48.640
And then yes, I get out the bone saw and should I go for it?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.640
Hi.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.640
Can you roll a surgery?

21:52.640 --> 21:54.640
Yeah, I'll roll first aid.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.640
Yeah, whatever the roll is.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.640
Are you not familiar with Call of Cthulhu?

21:58.640 --> 22:00.640
I'm not.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.640
I'm not, I'm not really.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.640
I played it once.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.640
Oh, nice.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.640
Did you have fun?

22:08.640 --> 22:10.640
I had a ton of fun the ones I played it.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.640
Oh, shit.

22:13.200 --> 22:16.200
I have not because I never subscribed to your Patreon.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.200
That's fine. You don't have to.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.200
I didn't.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.200
You can just subscribe for a month and download it all.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.200
No, I don't have a lot of money, Zach.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.200
Subscriptions start with as low as $5.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.200
Us too, I've heard it all.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.200
I was going to say, you're a shit salesman.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.200
Like, you don't have to.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.200
When people are like, sorry, I don't subscribe to the Patreon,

22:36.200 --> 22:38.200
I'm like, well, I'm not going to talk to you until you do.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.200
Oh, yeah.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.200
Luke goes for the total ice out.

22:42.760 --> 22:46.760
Okay, so do you roll like D20s in this or what?

22:46.760 --> 22:48.760
Oh, D100s, 2D10s.

22:48.760 --> 22:50.760
Oh, that's such a good question.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.760
Yeah, so are you using a mechanical dice roller?

22:52.760 --> 22:54.760
I'm on Google.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.760
Just roll dice.

22:56.760 --> 22:59.760
Yeah, I just said mechanical dice roller.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.760
I don't know what that is, but it sounds cool.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.760
I want one of those, man.

23:03.760 --> 23:07.760
That's a status symbol for role playing podcasters

23:07.760 --> 23:10.760
is they get a really nice clacky mechanical dice roller.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.320
Okay, so I'm rolling a D100.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.320
A D100 is what we're looking for.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.320
What's your skill in first aid?

23:17.320 --> 23:19.320
My skill in first aid is 90.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.320
Oh.

23:21.320 --> 23:23.320
Then you're probably going to roll under it,

23:23.320 --> 23:25.320
which is what we're looking for.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.320
Now, wait, also Call of Cthulhu, if you just have a...

23:27.320 --> 23:29.320
We're not playing Call of Cthulhu.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.320
We're doing our standard role play game.

23:31.320 --> 23:33.320
Oh, it's just madness.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.320
We're out of left field here.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.320
We're just rolling under to succeed.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.320
If your dice match, it's a crit.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.880
That is a success.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.880
Crunch as a bone just snaps

23:43.880 --> 23:45.880
and literally one of the

23:45.880 --> 23:47.880
nerves is like hanging out

23:47.880 --> 23:49.880
on the end and it's just

23:49.880 --> 23:51.880
wiggling back and forth and

23:51.880 --> 23:54.880
Jurgen is like, I don't think I can take it anymore.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.880
I earlier forgot I had this accent

23:56.880 --> 23:58.880
when I was bad. My leg cut off

23:58.880 --> 24:00.880
and now it's just...

24:00.880 --> 24:02.880
And then he's just gone.

24:02.880 --> 24:04.880
His eyes roll back into the back of his head

24:04.880 --> 24:06.880
and you look down at a bloody stump

24:06.880 --> 24:08.880
that you've created and you know

24:09.440 --> 24:11.440
exactly what to do next, which is...

24:11.440 --> 24:13.440
Yeah, I say

24:13.440 --> 24:15.440
good work, Mrs.

24:15.440 --> 24:17.440
I mean, good work, Mrs. Knife

24:17.440 --> 24:19.440
let's tie a tourniquet on you.

24:21.440 --> 24:23.440
And then I tie a tourniquet on the leg.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.440
And then I'm like, you're gonna

24:25.440 --> 24:27.440
be fitted for a wooden leg.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.440
He's gonna be just like me.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.440
As he just lays back, tongue hanging out

24:31.440 --> 24:33.440
eyes rolled in the back of his head

24:33.440 --> 24:35.440
you can sense

24:35.440 --> 24:37.440
just sort of a pride

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
of Dr. Shark and of the ship in general

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
from everyone in the room

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
including Jurgen Stick who's passed out

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
which is fun for everyone.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
It's just like a really positive atmosphere right now.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I love that. Because somebody's leg got chopped off.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
But also Dr. Shark has like

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
crazy mobster clothes

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
in the 1700s.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I used my tie to tie

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
the tourniquet. It was really nice.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Yeah, I really hate the one.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Everyone on this ship thinks Dr. Shark

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
is the coolest person in the world.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
And desperately wants two peg legs.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
How many peg legs have you added to the crew

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
like voluntarily?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
I'll see. Let's check the chart.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Right next to the map

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
looks like 72 peg legs.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Weird because we only got

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
like 14 crew members.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
He did me hand

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
as well.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
And I hold up my very shitty

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
metal prosthetic hand.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And some people get addicted

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
and they just saw their peg legs off.

25:36.560 --> 25:38.560
Shorter and shorter.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.560
We got the shortest crew around.

25:40.560 --> 25:42.560
Oh my god, then you could fit in all the little

25:42.560 --> 25:44.560
you wouldn't have to have a nice boat

25:44.560 --> 25:46.560
because you could fit in all the small cabins

25:46.560 --> 25:48.560
if your peg legs were shorter.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.560
True, we got the smallest cabins too.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.560
We're going to have to think about that one

25:54.560 --> 25:56.560
visually, but also

25:56.560 --> 25:58.560
really, you're not thinking of the possibility

25:58.560 --> 26:00.560
of just intimidating enemy crews

26:00.560 --> 26:02.560
by having everybody river dance.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.120
Just pounding pegs

26:05.120 --> 26:07.120
on the fucking

26:07.120 --> 26:09.120
speaking of enemy crews

26:09.120 --> 26:11.120
speaking of pounding pegs

26:11.120 --> 26:13.120
you guys

26:13.120 --> 26:15.120
everyone wakes up

26:15.120 --> 26:17.120
the next morning to

26:17.120 --> 26:19.120
the sound of

26:19.120 --> 26:21.120
someone having a lovely time

26:21.120 --> 26:23.120
pleasurable experience

26:23.120 --> 26:25.120
on deck

26:25.120 --> 26:27.120
doing a peg jig?

26:27.120 --> 26:29.120
total morning after peg jig

26:29.120 --> 26:31.120
just doing pegging

26:31.680 --> 26:33.680
just hanging on the deck

26:33.680 --> 26:35.680
which is what we call our little dances.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.680
Alright, let's leave.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.680
As you guys awake in the morning

26:39.680 --> 26:41.680
to this lovely exclamation of joy

26:41.680 --> 26:43.680
you realize that it is

26:43.680 --> 26:45.680
probably

26:45.680 --> 26:47.680
Wavy Adler who has

26:47.680 --> 26:49.680
noticed that in the distance

26:49.680 --> 26:51.680
is a beautiful

26:51.680 --> 26:53.680
beautiful island

26:53.680 --> 26:55.680
Land ho!

26:55.680 --> 26:57.680
With smoke rising out from the middle of it

26:57.680 --> 26:59.680
there are four other ships

27:00.240 --> 27:02.240
that are parked

27:02.240 --> 27:04.240
what do ships do? They park

27:04.240 --> 27:06.240
dock

27:06.240 --> 27:08.240
or dock

27:08.240 --> 27:10.240
off the coast a bit

27:10.240 --> 27:12.240
they all have backup cameras

27:12.240 --> 27:14.240
what did we do before these things?

27:16.240 --> 27:18.240
Dude, I don't know

27:18.240 --> 27:20.240
I live in a residential ass neighborhood

27:20.240 --> 27:22.240
and I'm like how did I not run over

27:22.240 --> 27:24.240
children repeatedly

27:24.240 --> 27:26.240
before a backup camera

27:26.240 --> 27:28.240
you didn't know, you didn't see them

27:28.800 --> 27:30.800
I just maimed and moved on

27:30.800 --> 27:32.800
so there are four other ships

27:32.800 --> 27:34.800
their flags flying high in the air

27:34.800 --> 27:36.800
as well as their little friend boats

27:36.800 --> 27:38.800
hanging out on the shore

27:38.800 --> 27:40.800
tenders

27:40.800 --> 27:42.800
their chicken tendies are hanging out on the shore

27:42.800 --> 27:44.800
there's four of those

27:44.800 --> 27:46.800
little man boats

27:46.800 --> 27:48.800
what are they called? tendies?

27:48.800 --> 27:50.800
so the tendies are already

27:50.800 --> 27:52.800
hanging out

27:52.800 --> 27:54.800
so you guys are the fifth to arrive

27:54.800 --> 27:56.800
what else we got?

27:57.360 --> 27:59.360
that's pretty much all you can see right now

27:59.360 --> 28:01.360
unless you want to give me the old spot

28:01.360 --> 28:03.360
Hayden or

28:03.360 --> 28:05.360
I'd like to give you a spot, yeah

28:05.360 --> 28:07.360
yeah

28:07.360 --> 28:09.360
it's a 41

28:09.360 --> 28:11.360
it's 41

28:11.360 --> 28:13.360
so my talent is that I can roll a bonus dice

28:13.360 --> 28:15.360
can I just do that in case I get a

28:15.360 --> 28:17.360
yeah, in case you match your dice and get a crit

28:17.360 --> 28:19.360
I got a 19 on a 25

28:19.360 --> 28:21.360
that sounds like such a fake talent, I believe you

28:21.360 --> 28:23.360
but my talent is

28:23.360 --> 28:25.360
I can roll a bonus dice

28:25.920 --> 28:27.920
it's a really great talent

28:27.920 --> 28:29.920
it says I get to keep doing it as long as I want

28:32.320 --> 28:34.320
let me know when you crit and then we'll move on

28:34.320 --> 28:36.320
basically if I'm not happy

28:36.320 --> 28:38.320
I just get to decide

28:38.320 --> 28:40.320
I also succeeded on the spot, Hayden

28:40.320 --> 28:42.320
yeah, I got a 20

28:42.320 --> 28:44.320
I succeed

28:44.320 --> 28:46.320
with every single person succeeding

28:46.320 --> 28:48.320
I'm going to give you a full run down

28:48.320 --> 28:50.320
so what we've got here is

28:50.320 --> 28:52.320
we've got four other ships

28:52.320 --> 28:54.320
I'll describe their flags to give you an idea

28:54.320 --> 28:56.320
of who these pirates are

28:56.320 --> 28:58.320
one of the flags has a

28:58.320 --> 29:00.320
cannon that is wearing

29:00.320 --> 29:02.320
a powdered wig

29:02.320 --> 29:04.320
one of the ships has

29:04.320 --> 29:06.320
the exact military flag

29:06.320 --> 29:08.320
from Great Britain

29:08.320 --> 29:10.320
the ol' chestnut, what do they call it?

29:10.320 --> 29:12.320
the Union Jack

29:12.320 --> 29:14.320
that guy

29:14.320 --> 29:16.320
he's got a

29:16.320 --> 29:18.320
bottle over the middle of it

29:18.320 --> 29:20.320
they've embroidered a big bottle of rum

29:20.320 --> 29:22.320
over the middle of the Union Jack

29:22.320 --> 29:24.320
the next one is

29:24.320 --> 29:26.320
a skeleton

29:26.320 --> 29:28.320
with horns

29:28.320 --> 29:30.320
and then a beard

29:30.320 --> 29:32.320
that is not on the face

29:32.320 --> 29:34.320
so much, it's just around the neck

29:34.320 --> 29:36.320
area of the

29:36.320 --> 29:38.320
skeleton

29:38.320 --> 29:40.320
argh, there be neckbeard

29:40.320 --> 29:42.320
it's the dread pirate neckbeard

29:42.320 --> 29:44.320
of course you've heard of him

29:44.320 --> 29:46.320
and then the last one

29:46.320 --> 29:48.320
is two music notes

29:48.320 --> 29:50.320
not sure when those were invented

29:50.320 --> 29:52.320
quite a while

29:52.320 --> 29:54.320
but

29:54.320 --> 29:56.320
those two music notes are

29:56.320 --> 29:58.320
like swinging

29:58.320 --> 30:00.320
off of one ship

30:00.320 --> 30:02.320
the notes are flinging themselves

30:02.320 --> 30:04.320
away from the ship that is on the flag

30:04.320 --> 30:06.320
as well, on the shore

30:06.320 --> 30:08.320
you see a massive

30:08.320 --> 30:10.320
statue, you're not sure yet

30:10.320 --> 30:12.320
until you get there what the statue is

30:12.320 --> 30:14.320
of, but as islands

30:14.320 --> 30:16.320
ought to have, there's a

30:16.320 --> 30:18.320
large humanoid statue

30:18.320 --> 30:20.320
right on the shore

30:20.320 --> 30:22.320
as well as some other just like

30:22.320 --> 30:24.320
piles of seemingly ash

30:24.320 --> 30:26.320
that's pretty much all you can see from here

30:26.320 --> 30:28.320
and we're gonna get you guys on one of those

30:28.320 --> 30:30.320
tendies and head into the shore

30:30.320 --> 30:32.320
I would assume

30:32.320 --> 30:34.320
Jurgen is getting over having

30:34.320 --> 30:36.320
a quarter of the legs

30:36.320 --> 30:38.320
that he had before

30:38.320 --> 30:40.320
knee down on one side, I believe he is

30:40.320 --> 30:42.320
about a quarter down

30:42.320 --> 30:44.320
yeah I guess, yeah

30:44.320 --> 30:46.320
court low

30:46.320 --> 30:48.320
Dr. Shark as they make their way

30:48.320 --> 30:50.320
onto the deck

30:50.320 --> 30:52.320
I'm a doctor, sorry I was gonna say

30:52.320 --> 30:54.320
I'm a doctor not a fraction

30:54.320 --> 30:56.320
doctor

30:58.320 --> 31:00.320
I don't care which number

31:00.320 --> 31:02.320
is above another or

31:02.320 --> 31:04.320
what have you, but I'm alive today

31:04.320 --> 31:06.320
and that's likely I made it through the night

31:06.320 --> 31:08.320
because of you, oh yeah no problem

31:08.320 --> 31:10.320
just don't mention this to anybody

31:10.320 --> 31:14.320
laughter

31:14.320 --> 31:16.320
he quickly unrolls his pant leg

31:16.320 --> 31:18.320
to cover the peg

31:18.320 --> 31:20.320
who would take

31:20.320 --> 31:22.320
charge in this situation of

31:22.320 --> 31:24.320
getting the crew ready to

31:24.320 --> 31:26.320
go ashore, I can get you there

31:26.320 --> 31:28.320
yeah I mean you're good at like navigation

31:28.320 --> 31:30.320
and stuff so you would probably be

31:30.320 --> 31:32.320
commanding the tender

31:32.320 --> 31:34.320
I rolled

31:34.320 --> 31:36.320
a 3 for my navigation skill

31:36.320 --> 31:38.320
which means we get there so

31:38.320 --> 31:40.320
slick and smooth

31:40.320 --> 31:42.320
no issues whatsoever

31:42.320 --> 31:44.320
in the boat on the way there

31:44.320 --> 31:46.320
Alvester looks at Dr. Shark

31:46.320 --> 31:48.320
and he's like

31:48.320 --> 31:50.320
I found another one

31:50.320 --> 31:52.320
and he pulls his shirt up and there's just like

31:52.320 --> 31:54.320
another sore on his body but there's also

31:54.320 --> 31:56.320
like hundreds of sores

31:56.320 --> 31:58.320
oh wow that's quite the sore

31:58.320 --> 32:00.320
hey Mrs. Knife check out this sore

32:00.320 --> 32:02.320
what a looker

32:02.320 --> 32:04.320
laughter

32:04.320 --> 32:06.320
and Al feels like

32:06.320 --> 32:08.320
happy, he feels like

32:08.320 --> 32:10.320
yeah it is a good one and then he just puts his

32:10.320 --> 32:12.320
shirt back down and like stares off

32:12.320 --> 32:14.320
into the distance, yeah it's an impressive sore

32:14.320 --> 32:16.320
laughter

32:16.320 --> 32:18.320
oh now I'm doing mob

32:18.320 --> 32:20.320
about halfway there Al

32:20.320 --> 32:22.320
wants to swim because the salt water

32:22.320 --> 32:24.320
really helps his

32:24.320 --> 32:26.320
stings real bad in the sores

32:26.320 --> 32:28.320
I knew a guy that we used to

32:28.320 --> 32:30.320
drag behind the boat to get him to talk

32:30.320 --> 32:32.320
so I mean as long as you don't say anything

32:32.320 --> 32:34.320
we could drag you behind the boat

32:34.320 --> 32:36.320
see how your sores like it or whatever

32:36.320 --> 32:38.320
laughter

32:38.320 --> 32:40.320
Al takes the doctor's advice

32:40.320 --> 32:42.320
to heart and he uses

32:42.320 --> 32:44.320
what is it, rope use

32:44.320 --> 32:46.320
skill to tie himself

32:46.320 --> 32:48.320
behind the boat, very well done, I don't think

32:48.320 --> 32:50.320
you need to roll but I appreciate you going for it

32:50.320 --> 32:52.320
he succeeded, yeah nice

32:52.320 --> 32:54.320
I love Pope Cthulhu, yeah he succeeded

32:54.320 --> 32:56.320
carry on

32:56.320 --> 32:58.320
he ties himself behind the boat

32:58.320 --> 33:00.320
he's having a decent

33:00.320 --> 33:02.320
time back there, like an inner

33:02.320 --> 33:04.320
he's inventing wakeboarding

33:04.320 --> 33:06.320
laughter

33:06.320 --> 33:08.320
he is the wakeboard

33:08.320 --> 33:10.320
he is the wakeboard, what's Mr. Smiths doing

33:10.320 --> 33:12.320
on the way in, Mr. Smiths is

33:12.320 --> 33:14.320
Spitz, Spitz, Smiths

33:14.320 --> 33:16.320
Jimmy Smiths is

33:16.320 --> 33:18.320
Mr. Spitz is

33:18.320 --> 33:20.320
eyeing the island with incredible

33:20.320 --> 33:22.320
suspicion, but he also has a moment

33:22.320 --> 33:24.320
to praise the navigation of

33:24.320 --> 33:26.320
Wavy Adler

33:26.320 --> 33:28.320
is I always thought being on a

33:28.320 --> 33:30.320
sheer glass when you had

33:30.320 --> 33:32.320
a window with Mr. Adler

33:32.320 --> 33:34.320
it's just a matter of making sure that your

33:34.320 --> 33:36.320
oars are in sync with the natural

33:36.320 --> 33:38.320
motion of the waves, he's not

33:38.320 --> 33:40.320
listening, he like

33:40.320 --> 33:42.320
one eye is so

33:42.320 --> 33:44.320
incredibly squinted at the island and

33:44.320 --> 33:46.320
the other eye is so big

33:46.320 --> 33:48.320
at you?

33:48.320 --> 33:50.320
both dead on at the island

33:50.320 --> 33:52.320
but he is just assessing

33:52.320 --> 33:54.320
Mrs. Smiths don't trust no Spitz

33:54.320 --> 33:56.320
change your name

33:56.320 --> 33:58.320
Mrs. Spitz

33:58.320 --> 34:00.320
Mrs. Smiths don't trust nobody

34:00.320 --> 34:02.320
not even in Ireland

34:02.320 --> 34:04.320
as you come upon the island

34:04.320 --> 34:06.320
also I've got a monkey on my chest, I forgot about my monkey

34:06.320 --> 34:08.320
also I have a monkey on my chest

34:08.320 --> 34:10.320
also we're all playing I have a monkey on my chest

34:10.320 --> 34:12.320
wait, wait, let's talk about it

34:12.320 --> 34:14.320
let's not

34:14.320 --> 34:16.320
what's eating you son?

34:16.320 --> 34:18.320
this monkey is giving you sores

34:18.320 --> 34:20.320
10 feet behind is

34:20.320 --> 34:22.320
the boat

34:22.320 --> 34:24.320
you're in the salt water

34:24.320 --> 34:26.320
with your open sores and your screams

34:26.320 --> 34:28.320
are haunting us all

34:28.320 --> 34:30.320
but my monkey is there to give me comfort

34:30.320 --> 34:32.320
Jesus

34:32.320 --> 34:34.320
which is my monkeys name

34:34.320 --> 34:36.320
now, Jesus the monkey

34:36.320 --> 34:38.320
give me comfort?

34:38.320 --> 34:40.320
give me comfort

34:40.320 --> 34:42.320
give me comfort

34:42.320 --> 34:44.320
that's blaspheming son

34:44.320 --> 34:46.320
that's a cult leader name, hello my name is

34:46.320 --> 34:48.320
Jesus give me comfort

34:48.320 --> 34:50.320
yeah, love that

34:50.320 --> 34:52.320
when you guys see this statue as you approach the island

34:52.320 --> 34:54.320
you notice that the statue actually

34:54.320 --> 34:56.320
has a lot of alligator facial

34:56.320 --> 34:58.320
features that are alligator-ish

34:58.320 --> 35:00.320
it's got a alligator face

35:00.320 --> 35:02.320
it's a human body with an alligator head

35:02.320 --> 35:04.320
it's an anthropomorphized gator

35:04.320 --> 35:06.320
man

35:06.320 --> 35:08.320
I'm not the only owl here

35:10.320 --> 35:12.320
does it have a gator tail?

35:12.320 --> 35:14.320
oh you're not sure, the gator tail might be

35:14.320 --> 35:16.320
buried, however the long

35:16.320 --> 35:18.320
snoot of the gator seems to make

35:18.320 --> 35:20.320
a bit of a platform that you could

35:20.320 --> 35:22.320
walk out on and as you

35:22.320 --> 35:24.320
oh it's massive, and as you get there

35:24.320 --> 35:26.320
you see that there's actually a ladder

35:26.320 --> 35:28.320
up the back that

35:28.320 --> 35:30.320
is kind of like scales, but it's a ladder

35:30.320 --> 35:32.320
that you can climb up about

35:32.320 --> 35:34.320
13, 5 meters, I don't know

35:34.320 --> 35:36.320
15 feet up to the

35:36.320 --> 35:38.320
13, 5 meters? 13.5

35:38.320 --> 35:40.320
I'm a doctor, not an expert on the metric system

35:40.320 --> 35:42.320
she already said

35:42.320 --> 35:44.320
now I'm doing her

35:46.320 --> 35:48.320

35:48.320 --> 35:50.320

35:50.320 --> 35:52.320

35:54.320 --> 35:56.320

35:58.320 --> 36:00.320
flowing in the wind

36:00.320 --> 36:02.320

36:02.320 --> 36:04.320
PTPB shop is now up, you can buy

36:04.320 --> 36:06.320

it's a vampire themed

36:36.320 --> 36:38.320
abandoned water park from season 1

36:40.320 --> 36:42.320
I start climbing down

36:42.320 --> 36:44.320
the ladder

36:44.320 --> 36:46.320
are all these other pirate crews that we've now joined, are they all being

36:46.320 --> 36:48.320
cordial to each other, or is there a fighting breaking out already

36:48.320 --> 36:50.320
as these tendies hit the beach

36:50.320 --> 36:52.320
you see that the other four

36:52.320 --> 36:54.320
wait, the tendies hit the beach

36:54.320 --> 36:56.320
the other four tendies

36:56.320 --> 36:58.320
are empty

36:58.320 --> 37:00.320
mad empty, and there's

37:00.320 --> 37:02.320
no one on this beach that you

37:02.320 --> 37:04.320
can see currently

37:04.320 --> 37:06.320
but as you all are there

37:06.320 --> 37:08.320
you notice that there seems to be

37:08.320 --> 37:10.320
like a ditch or a channel

37:10.320 --> 37:12.320
dug into the sand

37:12.320 --> 37:14.320
along the coastline

37:14.320 --> 37:16.320
parallel to the water for as far

37:16.320 --> 37:18.320
as you can see, and it's got a red

37:18.320 --> 37:20.320
liquid in it

37:20.320 --> 37:22.320
let me see if I can tell if this is blood

37:22.320 --> 37:24.320
not that I would do anything

37:24.320 --> 37:26.320
I don't see a person here to fix

37:26.320 --> 37:28.320
or whatever

37:28.320 --> 37:30.320
should I roll to see if it's blood

37:30.320 --> 37:32.320
I mean that seems a bit absurd

37:32.320 --> 37:34.320
you get down, you stick your whole head in it

37:34.320 --> 37:36.320
no, so it's definitely blood

37:36.320 --> 37:38.320
you can smell the

37:38.320 --> 37:40.320
iron as you approach the

37:40.320 --> 37:42.320
long channel, it's about six inches

37:42.320 --> 37:44.320
wide, but it is

37:44.320 --> 37:46.320
blood, I can smell the iron in it

37:46.320 --> 37:48.320
it's about six inches wide

37:48.320 --> 37:50.320
it's wet, but not water

37:50.320 --> 37:52.320
it's ironic

37:52.320 --> 37:54.320
isn't it?

37:54.320 --> 37:56.320
she liked him

37:58.320 --> 38:00.320
yeah, as everybody's announcing it

38:00.320 --> 38:02.320
Spitz is taking just a huge

38:02.320 --> 38:04.320
fingerful and tasting it

38:04.320 --> 38:06.320
a full

38:06.320 --> 38:08.320
thirty seconds after it's been announced

38:08.320 --> 38:10.320
it's a swig bit coagulated

38:10.320 --> 38:12.320
it's blood

38:12.320 --> 38:14.320
it's kind of a filmy layer on top

38:14.320 --> 38:16.320
when you dig your finger in

38:16.320 --> 38:18.320
you would have a film on your finger

38:18.320 --> 38:20.320
as you lift up

38:20.320 --> 38:22.320
it's coagulated

38:22.320 --> 38:24.320
what movie?

38:24.320 --> 38:26.320
that was a little joke about the film part

38:26.320 --> 38:28.320
sorry

38:28.320 --> 38:30.320
moving on

38:32.320 --> 38:34.320
Mrs. Knife is such an asset

38:36.320 --> 38:38.320
Jesus Christ, go look for

38:38.320 --> 38:40.320
the other pirates

38:40.320 --> 38:42.320
I want to send my monkey out to scout

38:42.320 --> 38:44.320
oh, yeah

38:44.320 --> 38:46.320
awesome

38:46.320 --> 38:48.320
alright, send Jesus

38:48.320 --> 38:50.320
I was about to be like, I'll put you in charge

38:50.320 --> 38:52.320
how does your

38:52.320 --> 38:54.320
monkey work, dude?

38:54.320 --> 38:56.320
animal handling, I guess

38:56.320 --> 38:58.320
a pass

38:58.320 --> 39:00.320
what does your monkey sound like?

39:00.320 --> 39:02.320
ok, sick, I'll see what I can do

39:02.320 --> 39:04.320
alright, so

39:04.320 --> 39:06.320
oh, better than I did

39:06.320 --> 39:08.320
you sound just like Jesus Christ

39:10.320 --> 39:12.320
sand

39:12.320 --> 39:14.320
sand is like flying up behind

39:14.320 --> 39:16.320
the monkey's paws and feet

39:16.320 --> 39:18.320
as it clambers about

39:18.320 --> 39:20.320
toward the tree line that is

39:20.320 --> 39:22.320
on the opposite side from the water

39:22.320 --> 39:24.320
on this beach it has hands, by the way

39:24.320 --> 39:26.320
it's a monkey and then it stops really quick

39:26.320 --> 39:28.320
on its hands, because it's a monkey

39:28.320 --> 39:30.320
and it turns around

39:30.320 --> 39:32.320
it turns around by putting its head

39:32.320 --> 39:34.320
in between its legs and looking back at you

39:34.320 --> 39:36.320
oh, it's a funny monkey

39:36.320 --> 39:38.320
oh, it's a hilarious monkey

39:38.320 --> 39:40.320
which you know to mean

39:40.320 --> 39:42.320
there's somebody watching

39:42.320 --> 39:44.320
boys, what do you say?

39:44.320 --> 39:46.320
there's somebody watching us

39:46.320 --> 39:48.320
holy shit

39:48.320 --> 39:50.320
let's check it out

39:50.320 --> 39:52.320
oh, so we watch them back

39:52.320 --> 39:54.320
Wavy flings out his

39:54.320 --> 39:56.320
spyglass in a really

39:56.320 --> 39:58.320
efficient flourish

39:58.320 --> 40:00.320
pulls it up to his eye and he wants to spot

40:00.320 --> 40:02.320
hidden right where the monkey was indicating

40:02.320 --> 40:04.320
awesome, yeah, go ahead and roll with

40:04.320 --> 40:06.320
your

40:06.320 --> 40:08.320
it's a 16

40:08.320 --> 40:10.320
you want to roll again?

40:10.320 --> 40:12.320
or a 56

40:12.320 --> 40:14.320
alright, so with the

40:14.320 --> 40:16.320
success there, you notice that

40:16.320 --> 40:18.320
there is a tall, bald

40:18.320 --> 40:20.320
overweight man who is not

40:20.320 --> 40:22.320
paying attention to you

40:22.320 --> 40:24.320
but he is just kind of like standing and

40:24.320 --> 40:26.320
surveying the beach, he seems

40:26.320 --> 40:28.320
to think that he is being sneaky

40:28.320 --> 40:30.320
but he is not?

40:30.320 --> 40:32.320
we got a guy over there

40:32.320 --> 40:34.320
he looks like he's trying to hide from us

40:34.320 --> 40:36.320
he ain't hiding too well

40:36.320 --> 40:38.320
hey you, you look like you're

40:38.320 --> 40:40.320
being sneaky, but you're not

40:40.320 --> 40:42.320
being very sneaky

40:42.320 --> 40:44.320
ya bastard

40:44.320 --> 40:46.320
I start running at him

40:46.320 --> 40:48.320
we've been playing the forest

40:48.320 --> 40:50.320
yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

40:50.320 --> 40:52.320
so as you run, you'd have to jump

40:52.320 --> 40:54.320
over this little channel of blood, yeah?

40:54.320 --> 40:56.320
I step right in it

40:56.320 --> 40:58.320
step right in it

40:58.320 --> 41:00.320
oh, that's not what you want to do in a Delta Green game

41:00.320 --> 41:02.320
no, but I have open sores all over

41:02.320 --> 41:04.320
my body, so, you know

41:04.320 --> 41:06.320
oh god

41:06.320 --> 41:08.320
it just gets right in there

41:08.320 --> 41:10.320
so yeah, it like helps

41:10.320 --> 41:12.320
it's blood

41:12.320 --> 41:14.320
if you could expect these consequences in 12 to 32 hours

41:14.320 --> 41:16.320
maybe like 6 now

41:16.320 --> 41:18.320
also it's old times, but before germs

41:18.320 --> 41:20.320
leg

41:20.320 --> 41:22.320
right into the blood, running towards

41:22.320 --> 41:24.320
the bald guy

41:24.320 --> 41:26.320
he doesn't even notice that you're running at him

41:26.320 --> 41:28.320
I yell, I see that he isn't noticing me

41:28.320 --> 41:30.320
and I yell at him because I don't want to like

41:30.320 --> 41:32.320
tackle him, but I'm, that's what I'm

41:32.320 --> 41:34.320
about to do unless he tells me not to

41:34.320 --> 41:36.320
his eyes get really big and he just

41:36.320 --> 41:38.320
kind of stares at you with these big

41:38.320 --> 41:40.320
eyes

41:40.320 --> 41:42.320
is he a pirate?

41:42.320 --> 41:44.320
no, he doesn't seem to be dressed like a pirate

41:44.320 --> 41:46.320
he's just kind of a guy dressed like a dude

41:46.320 --> 41:48.320
he's just wearing normal clothes

41:48.320 --> 41:50.320
for like a person of this time

41:50.320 --> 41:52.320
period

41:52.320 --> 41:54.320
I give it a second thought and I stop

41:54.320 --> 41:56.320
inches away from him

41:56.320 --> 41:58.320
oh, hey

41:58.320 --> 42:00.320
hey

42:00.320 --> 42:02.320
I'm Mitch

42:02.320 --> 42:04.320
Al, did you step in my channel?

42:04.320 --> 42:06.320
I just look down at my leg

42:06.320 --> 42:08.320
like duh

42:08.320 --> 42:10.320
can we go check and make sure it's okay?

42:10.320 --> 42:12.320
what's okay?

42:12.320 --> 42:14.320
you heard something?

42:14.320 --> 42:16.320
no, it's just my trench

42:16.320 --> 42:18.320
and he just starts walking kind of

42:18.320 --> 42:20.320
back towards the beach to check out

42:20.320 --> 42:22.320
this moat and he's like, yeah, these are

42:22.320 --> 42:24.320
my moats, so they can't be

42:24.320 --> 42:26.320
broken

42:26.320 --> 42:28.320
hey doc, in your professional opinion

42:28.320 --> 42:30.320
is there any reason a man might have a blood trough?

42:30.320 --> 42:32.320
in my many years

42:32.320 --> 42:34.320
I've seen like a few blood troughs

42:34.320 --> 42:36.320
but never any that people

42:36.320 --> 42:38.320
willingly and a lively captive

42:38.320 --> 42:40.320
you know what I mean?

42:40.320 --> 42:42.320
not for no good reason, Al

42:42.320 --> 42:44.320
no, we've got good reasons, but that's not

42:44.320 --> 42:46.320
you're not here for reasons, you're here to

42:46.320 --> 42:48.320
do the ship race that you guys

42:48.320 --> 42:50.320
are in

42:50.320 --> 42:52.320
if you want to come with me this way, let's get going

42:52.320 --> 42:54.320
yeah, let's do it

42:54.320 --> 42:56.320
I'm kind of like messing with the sand

42:56.320 --> 42:58.320
to fix where Alabaster Al

42:58.320 --> 43:00.320
had stepped on this blood trough

43:00.320 --> 43:02.320
and he's just kind of making it the exact same width

43:02.320 --> 43:04.320
as everything else

43:04.320 --> 43:06.320
I'm Mitch, hey

43:06.320 --> 43:08.320
Mitch, is this the blood of the other crews

43:08.320 --> 43:10.320
who compete in this competition?

43:10.320 --> 43:12.320
no, they're waiting

43:12.320 --> 43:14.320
we're all waiting for you guys and one other crew

43:14.320 --> 43:16.320
we gotta get going

43:16.320 --> 43:18.320
it's obviously some sort of blood curse

43:18.320 --> 43:20.320
and I dip my knife into the blood

43:20.320 --> 43:22.320
so that I have the blood curse knife

43:22.320 --> 43:24.320
that's fine, you can have the blood

43:24.320 --> 43:26.320
you can have a blood curse knife, that's okay

43:26.320 --> 43:28.320
I don't think that'll help

43:28.320 --> 43:30.320
at least make somebody sick if I stab them

43:30.320 --> 43:32.320
yeah, that's gross

43:32.320 --> 43:34.320
well anyway

43:34.320 --> 43:36.320
so yeah, these are all my canals

43:36.320 --> 43:38.320
just kind of like

43:38.320 --> 43:40.320
water courses, whatever

43:40.320 --> 43:42.320
just going through

43:42.320 --> 43:44.320
shout out to Nate Abbott from St. Louis

43:44.320 --> 43:46.320
for Mitch Diggory

43:46.320 --> 43:48.320
by the way, Diggory's my last name

43:48.320 --> 43:50.320
I'm Mitch Diggory, it's nice to meet you guys

43:50.320 --> 43:52.320
I love being useful

43:52.320 --> 43:54.320
so I'd just really like to help

43:54.320 --> 43:56.320
direct you to the way to go

43:56.320 --> 43:58.320
okay, see you never

43:58.320 --> 44:00.320
is his character description that he's helpful?

44:00.320 --> 44:02.320
he loves being useful, I mean I love being useful

44:02.320 --> 44:04.320
that's great

44:04.320 --> 44:06.320
Zach's like, I wrote this scenario and I had a lot

44:06.320 --> 44:08.320
of canals of blood to dig

44:08.320 --> 44:10.320
so

44:10.320 --> 44:12.320
it kind of worked out perfect

44:12.320 --> 44:14.320
and a huge backlog of NPC names

44:14.320 --> 44:16.320
that we need to get rid of

44:16.320 --> 44:18.320
are you going to name everybody in these pirate crews?

44:18.320 --> 44:20.320
no, it's just I'm Mitch

44:20.320 --> 44:22.320
so let's keep going

44:22.320 --> 44:24.320
and so he starts walking away from his

44:24.320 --> 44:26.320
ditch and his gutter and his trench

44:26.320 --> 44:28.320
I say we follow him

44:28.320 --> 44:30.320
like this is the way, the money, right?

44:30.320 --> 44:32.320
yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys wanted to

44:32.320 --> 44:34.320
win the opportunity

44:34.320 --> 44:36.320
to make a bunch of money so you never

44:36.320 --> 44:38.320
have to pirate again or whatever

44:38.320 --> 44:40.320
yeah, the pirate games

44:40.320 --> 44:42.320
oh, is that where you guys have been calling him?

44:42.320 --> 44:44.320
that's where we've been calling him

44:44.320 --> 44:46.320
yeah, that's where I've been calling him, I've been trying to get

44:46.320 --> 44:48.320
cash on, I think Wavy

44:48.320 --> 44:50.320
is with me but I don't know if most of the crew

44:50.320 --> 44:52.320
wants to see it, I like the Olympics

44:52.320 --> 44:54.320
the Olympics

44:54.320 --> 44:56.320
has a significant supporter

44:56.320 --> 44:58.320
a lot of people

44:58.320 --> 45:00.320
are just calling it the Crucible

45:00.320 --> 45:02.320
yeah, I never read it

45:02.320 --> 45:04.320
I've been calling

45:04.320 --> 45:06.320
it the big thing, like we

45:06.320 --> 45:08.320
getting ready for the big thing

45:08.320 --> 45:10.320
I

45:10.320 --> 45:12.320
always got to appreciate your funny way of

45:12.320 --> 45:14.320
talking, Dottoshock, you sound like

45:14.320 --> 45:16.320
you're from another time entirely

45:16.320 --> 45:18.320
you sound like you're from another country

45:18.320 --> 45:20.320
entirely

45:20.320 --> 45:22.320
pretty wild stuff

45:22.320 --> 45:24.320
Dr. Shark has had to go to

45:24.320 --> 45:26.320
multiple HR meetings about

45:26.320 --> 45:28.320
the other international people on board

45:28.320 --> 45:30.320
yeah

45:30.320 --> 45:32.320
obviously a mobster from the 20s

45:32.320 --> 45:34.320
would have to go to a shitload of

45:34.320 --> 45:36.320
fucking HR meetings

45:36.320 --> 45:38.320
weird, I'm the only one who came back

45:38.320 --> 45:40.320
from them

45:44.320 --> 45:46.320
oh fuck

45:46.320 --> 45:48.320
as you guys head off

45:48.320 --> 45:50.320
Beth, I need you to choose between those flags

45:50.320 --> 45:52.320
that we saw earlier

45:52.320 --> 45:54.320
do you remember any of the

45:54.320 --> 45:56.320
I want the neckbeard boy

45:56.320 --> 45:58.320
yeah, well of course

45:58.320 --> 46:00.320
perfect

46:00.320 --> 46:02.320
so as you guys are heading

46:02.320 --> 46:04.320
further into the jungle

46:04.320 --> 46:06.320
of this island you're going through

46:06.320 --> 46:08.320
there's a path that's already kind of been created

46:08.320 --> 46:10.320
that Mitch is sort of leading you

46:10.320 --> 46:12.320
down and as you guys are going

46:12.320 --> 46:14.320
you really can't see too far ahead of you

46:14.320 --> 46:16.320
because the thick is

46:16.320 --> 46:18.320
he's kind of moving you through

46:18.320 --> 46:20.320
this sort of channel

46:20.320 --> 46:22.320
of a pathway as the jungle

46:22.320 --> 46:24.320
kind of creeps around your head

46:24.320 --> 46:26.320
almost and creates a cave

46:26.320 --> 46:28.320
that you're kind of walking

46:28.320 --> 46:30.320
through almost

46:30.320 --> 46:32.320
and then all of a sudden you hear

46:32.320 --> 46:34.320
a

46:34.320 --> 46:36.320
oh no

46:36.320 --> 46:38.320
fucking shit

46:38.320 --> 46:40.320
no, this is somebody

46:40.320 --> 46:42.320
else's fault

46:42.320 --> 46:44.320
oh no

46:44.320 --> 46:46.320
and

46:46.320 --> 46:48.320
this is somebody

46:48.320 --> 46:50.320
else's fault

46:50.320 --> 46:52.320
from Mitch or a voice ahead on the trail

46:52.320 --> 46:54.320
no, it's a voice ahead and off to the side

46:54.320 --> 46:56.320
and you guys hit a clearing

46:56.320 --> 46:58.320
and you see ahead of you

46:58.320 --> 47:00.320
there is a slight fork in the road

47:00.320 --> 47:02.320
and this other pirate crew has clearly

47:02.320 --> 47:04.320
gone the wrong way

47:04.320 --> 47:06.320
and the captain

47:06.320 --> 47:08.320
he's wearing the hat and everything

47:08.320 --> 47:10.320
and boy does this guy have a beard

47:10.320 --> 47:12.320
but it is not on his jawline at all

47:12.320 --> 47:14.320
or above his lip

47:14.320 --> 47:16.320
it is just pure jaw down

47:16.320 --> 47:18.320
and it connects into his

47:18.320 --> 47:20.320
hamburger meat which is reaching

47:20.320 --> 47:22.320
up

47:22.320 --> 47:24.320
oh I hate that term

47:24.320 --> 47:26.320
his hamburger meat?

47:26.320 --> 47:28.320
we've covered this before

47:28.320 --> 47:30.320
it's chest hair

47:30.320 --> 47:32.320
apparently in one of the fast and furious movies

47:32.320 --> 47:34.320
ludicrous calls his chest hair hamburger meat

47:34.320 --> 47:36.320
and Zach threw that out casually one night

47:36.320 --> 47:38.320
and everybody says

47:38.320 --> 47:40.320
yeah that's wild lore to just be a part of a conversation

47:40.320 --> 47:42.320
I respect it

47:42.320 --> 47:44.320
though, so there

47:44.320 --> 47:46.320
and so like I said his hamburger meat is just climbing up

47:46.320 --> 47:48.320
to meet

47:48.320 --> 47:50.320
the surly, surly

47:50.320 --> 47:52.320
hairs that have made their way down

47:52.320 --> 47:54.320
from the chin toward the nape

47:54.320 --> 47:56.320
the nape and neck

47:56.320 --> 47:58.320
the nape and nape

47:58.320 --> 48:00.320
the lips, the teeth

48:00.320 --> 48:02.320
and he is

48:02.320 --> 48:04.320
drowning in some

48:04.320 --> 48:06.320
sort of quicksand

48:06.320 --> 48:08.320
and he is

48:08.320 --> 48:10.320
I'm gonna go ahead and roll real quick

48:10.320 --> 48:12.320
he is

48:12.320 --> 48:14.320
he is up to his thighs

48:14.320 --> 48:16.320
already and he is

48:16.320 --> 48:18.320
waggling so hard

48:18.320 --> 48:20.320
he is not being calm

48:20.320 --> 48:22.320
he is just like

48:22.320 --> 48:24.320
oh no, no everyone

48:24.320 --> 48:26.320
hey, hey, Waverly

48:26.320 --> 48:28.320
fuck, that's me, hey

48:28.320 --> 48:30.320
do you remember me?

48:30.320 --> 48:32.320
oh my god Neckbeard what are you doing here?

48:32.320 --> 48:34.320
it's a great guy, I'm Neckbeard

48:34.320 --> 48:36.320
and look at my crew

48:36.320 --> 48:38.320
and the crew is all like standing around

48:38.320 --> 48:40.320
and pointing at him

48:40.320 --> 48:42.320
and talking amongst themselves

48:42.320 --> 48:44.320
how far from like the edge is he?

48:44.320 --> 48:46.320
oh he's right in the middle yeah

48:46.320 --> 48:48.320
you'd have to get something long

48:48.320 --> 48:50.320
like how long? to kind of reach out

48:50.320 --> 48:52.320
maybe like five, six feet long

48:52.320 --> 48:54.320
to be able to pull him out

48:54.320 --> 48:56.320
that's longer than a monkey

48:58.320 --> 49:00.320
I know one way to handle this

49:00.320 --> 49:02.320
Mrs. Knife

49:02.320 --> 49:04.320
cut the legs

49:08.320 --> 49:10.320
no, no, no, no, no, no

49:10.320 --> 49:11.320
there's got to be another way

49:11.320 --> 49:12.320
trust him Captain Neckbeard

49:12.320 --> 49:13.320
he's a doctor

49:13.320 --> 49:14.320
I'm already up to my thighs

49:14.320 --> 49:15.320
what are you gonna take me out the hip?

49:15.320 --> 49:17.320
yeah, we might as well

49:17.320 --> 49:19.320
Captain Neckbeard up and see a lot of years

49:19.320 --> 49:21.320
and I never met a doctor

49:21.320 --> 49:22.320
as shrewd as Dr. Shark

49:22.320 --> 49:24.320
if he says your legs gotta go

49:24.320 --> 49:25.320
they gotta go

49:25.320 --> 49:27.320
boy let's find some wood planks

49:27.320 --> 49:29.320
to sit down so we can get over there

49:29.320 --> 49:31.320
to sew his legs up

49:32.320 --> 49:34.320
you're like Australian now

49:35.320 --> 49:37.320
that's what I'm gonna stick with

49:38.320 --> 49:40.320
happy birthday

49:40.320 --> 49:41.320
happy birthday

49:41.320 --> 49:43.320
my joy, joy, joy

49:43.320 --> 49:44.320
oh my god

49:44.320 --> 49:46.320
say yoyce

49:46.320 --> 49:48.320
noice, noice, no

49:48.320 --> 49:50.320
no I won't do it

49:50.320 --> 49:52.320
he, as you guys are

49:52.320 --> 49:54.320
literally having this conversation

49:54.320 --> 49:56.320
he has sunk

49:56.320 --> 49:58.320
he's sunk hip to nip at this point

49:58.320 --> 49:59.320
damn

49:59.320 --> 50:00.320
I'm sorry Nepo

50:00.320 --> 50:01.320
you're so hip to nip

50:01.320 --> 50:02.320
there's no hope for you

50:02.320 --> 50:04.320
and his arms are just like

50:04.320 --> 50:05.320
flailing about

50:05.320 --> 50:06.320
and he's like

50:06.320 --> 50:07.320
seriously

50:07.320 --> 50:08.320
no one

50:08.320 --> 50:09.320
throw me a rope

50:09.320 --> 50:10.320
fuck

50:10.320 --> 50:11.320
I can't cut the torso

50:11.320 --> 50:13.320
so I'm out of ideas

50:14.320 --> 50:16.320
okay you just save the head doctor

50:16.320 --> 50:17.320
mmm

50:17.320 --> 50:18.320
maybe, maybe

50:18.320 --> 50:19.320
what about the neck

50:19.320 --> 50:21.320
he needs his neck

50:21.320 --> 50:22.320
well

50:22.320 --> 50:24.320
I mean it's not his best feature

50:24.320 --> 50:25.320
does he need it though

50:25.320 --> 50:26.320
I mean we should ask the doctor

50:26.320 --> 50:27.320
does he need his neck

50:27.320 --> 50:28.320
for his bed

50:28.320 --> 50:31.320
most people think you need your neck to live

50:31.320 --> 50:32.320
umm

50:32.320 --> 50:33.320
there

50:34.320 --> 50:35.320
there

50:35.320 --> 50:36.320
there yeah

50:36.320 --> 50:37.320
I mean

50:37.320 --> 50:38.320
most people but

50:38.320 --> 50:39.320
there's a chance of a miracle

50:39.320 --> 50:40.320
ain't that right Nepo

50:40.320 --> 50:43.320
well always good to give it a shot I guess

50:43.320 --> 50:45.320
why don't you just pray

50:45.320 --> 50:47.320
hips to nips was a four

50:47.320 --> 50:48.320
he rolled a one this time

50:48.320 --> 50:49.320
so now he's nips to pits

50:49.320 --> 50:50.320
damn

50:50.320 --> 50:51.320
wait

50:51.320 --> 50:52.320
hips to nips, nips to pits

50:52.320 --> 50:53.320
what's

50:53.320 --> 50:54.320
he went from his hips to his nips

50:54.320 --> 50:56.320
now he's gone from his nips to his

50:56.320 --> 50:57.320
pits

50:57.320 --> 50:58.320
he's about to sink

50:58.320 --> 50:59.320
I get you

50:59.320 --> 51:00.320
a one is a nip to pits

51:00.320 --> 51:02.320
you're about to run out of rhyming biology

51:02.320 --> 51:04.320
so you're getting really dire

51:04.320 --> 51:07.320
you are fucked as a GM Zach

51:07.320 --> 51:08.320
well next is his dimps

51:08.320 --> 51:09.320
that's my secret

51:09.320 --> 51:10.320
oh

51:10.320 --> 51:11.320
the dimps yes

51:11.320 --> 51:12.320
the dimps and then the temps

51:12.320 --> 51:14.320
and then the temps and then your kaput

51:14.320 --> 51:15.320
okay then he's fine

51:15.320 --> 51:16.320
yeah he's fine

51:16.320 --> 51:17.320
he's got plenty of time

51:17.320 --> 51:18.320
yeah

51:18.320 --> 51:19.320
then he's limps

51:19.320 --> 51:24.320
can I like look on his crew to see if any of them happen to be wearing a rope as a belt

51:24.320 --> 51:25.320
yeah go ahead and roll

51:26.320 --> 51:27.320
on what?

51:27.320 --> 51:28.320
rope use

51:28.320 --> 51:29.320
rope use

51:29.320 --> 51:30.320
fuck still no

51:30.320 --> 51:31.320
I failed

51:31.320 --> 51:32.320
none of them are wearing belts

51:32.320 --> 51:37.320
they're all using both hands to hold their pants up

51:37.320 --> 51:38.320
which is why they're not helping

51:38.320 --> 51:42.320
no he failed his rope use roll so he can't identify the belts

51:42.320 --> 51:45.320
they're all clearly ropes

51:45.320 --> 51:47.320
as he starts to go under

51:47.320 --> 51:48.320
yeah

51:48.320 --> 51:49.320
because it's what's happening

51:49.320 --> 51:52.320
it was good seeing you again captain

51:53.320 --> 51:56.320
hey I know how to I know how to handle this situation

51:56.320 --> 52:00.320
mrs knife off with his head

52:00.320 --> 52:02.320
all right gotta chop the head

52:02.320 --> 52:07.320
yeah I mean the neck you need sometimes but uh not tonight

52:07.320 --> 52:09.320
not tonight

52:09.320 --> 52:11.320
you gotta trust him captain he's a certified doctor

52:11.320 --> 52:13.320
certified somewhere

52:13.320 --> 52:15.320
always helps me

52:15.320 --> 52:19.320
blood is just like pouring out of my face

52:19.320 --> 52:24.320
so I'm gonna try to crawl across the quicksand essentially

52:24.320 --> 52:30.320
to see if I can like chop off his head and get back before I start to sink

52:30.320 --> 52:32.320
yeah that seems really good

52:32.320 --> 52:37.320
so Beth I have here in order to crawl across this all you have to do is stay calm right

52:37.320 --> 52:40.320
so you just have to pass a marbles check

52:40.320 --> 52:43.320
so I want you to roll your marbles and see if you can hold on to your marbles

52:43.320 --> 52:47.320
okay and what what am I rolling for marbles 100?

52:47.320 --> 52:48.320
100

52:49.320 --> 52:53.320
and you're gonna roll against your marble score which is equal to your power

52:53.320 --> 52:58.320
okay where is my because I'm not sure I passed

52:58.320 --> 53:00.320
P.O.W. at the top of the sheet

53:00.320 --> 53:02.320
power power power

53:02.320 --> 53:04.320
under sizzler

53:04.320 --> 53:06.320
it's also under sanity

53:06.320 --> 53:11.320
okay I rolled yeah I rolled an 88 and I have an 80

53:11.320 --> 53:12.320
oh no

53:12.320 --> 53:13.320
watch your marbles

53:13.320 --> 53:15.320
watch your marbles

53:15.320 --> 53:16.320
it was 80

53:16.320 --> 53:17.320
okay well

53:18.320 --> 53:20.320
that'd be a critical failure

53:20.320 --> 53:21.320
oh no

53:21.320 --> 53:22.320
you're not calm

53:22.320 --> 53:23.320
we'll say that

53:23.320 --> 53:24.320
you lost your marbles

53:24.320 --> 53:28.320
as Dr. Shark begins to crawl out

53:28.320 --> 53:33.320
your left hand hits this quicksand and immediately you are shocked

53:33.320 --> 53:37.320
by how quickly your hand disappears into this quicksand

53:37.320 --> 53:45.320
and honestly your gut reaction is to hold still but there's nothing inside Dr. Shark that can hold still right now

53:45.320 --> 53:47.320
as you lose your marbles

53:47.320 --> 53:52.320
I think he's just like oh my god oh my god stop no what oh my god ew

53:53.320 --> 53:54.320
ew

53:54.320 --> 53:58.320
and ew is the last word that comes out as your second hand goes in

53:58.320 --> 54:02.320
and then the weight of your just moving forward pushes your face directly

54:02.320 --> 54:04.320
as you're like ew oh my god ew

54:04.320 --> 54:07.320
it's just ew

54:07.320 --> 54:11.320
as your mouth fills up with this quicksand and you start going head first in

54:11.320 --> 54:13.320
and now we just see

54:13.320 --> 54:15.320
let me roll a d4

54:15.320 --> 54:17.320
that's a four

54:17.320 --> 54:20.320
yeah so you are head shoulders

54:20.320 --> 54:22.320
it looks like she's doing a handstand in there

54:22.320 --> 54:24.320
he's showing off

54:26.320 --> 54:32.320
Dr. Shark is fully handstanded and your bottom half is sticking up out

54:32.320 --> 54:36.320
so we've got no biological limbs

54:36.320 --> 54:39.320
yeah we've just got two sticks in the air

54:40.320 --> 54:42.320
do you have like really cool mobster shoes on?

54:43.320 --> 54:45.320
probably yeah

54:45.320 --> 54:47.320
okay uh Mr. Spitz steals those

54:47.320 --> 54:49.320
no

54:50.320 --> 54:55.320
Mrs. Knife is like every man for himself and like completely disappears

54:55.320 --> 54:57.320
oh no

54:57.320 --> 54:59.320
I can see a shoe still on your shoulder

54:59.320 --> 55:01.320
I thought that part would be more on me about my shoes but

55:01.320 --> 55:04.320
Jesus Christ go go check his pockets

55:05.320 --> 55:07.320
I send my monkey and a pill for the rest

55:07.320 --> 55:09.320
oh you're gonna drown your monkey

55:09.320 --> 55:11.320
yeah now the monkey jumps out onto the legs

55:11.320 --> 55:13.320
onto the peg leg like a zoo

55:13.320 --> 55:15.320
oh I forgot it's a peg leg

55:15.320 --> 55:19.320
like a zoo enclosure fake like limb on a tree

55:19.320 --> 55:21.320
it jumps out and drabs onto this

55:21.320 --> 55:23.320
they were peg legs

55:23.320 --> 55:26.320
so you had awesome like gangster shoes

55:26.320 --> 55:28.320
onto your peg leg

55:29.320 --> 55:31.320
and then the monkey reaches in

55:31.320 --> 55:33.320
what do you got in those pockets Dr. Shark?

55:33.320 --> 55:35.320
oh I think there's like

55:35.320 --> 55:38.320
like a bunch of like rings from people he's definitely killed

55:38.320 --> 55:40.320
and like a cool like

55:40.320 --> 55:42.320

55:42.320 --> 55:44.320
a cool like $300

55:44.320 --> 55:46.320
no I think this is like

55:46.320 --> 55:48.320
from straight the streets of New York

55:48.320 --> 55:50.320
like mobster shit

55:50.320 --> 55:52.320
$300 in like 1933 bills

55:52.320 --> 55:54.320
he's got like a quarter from 1975 for some reason

55:58.320 --> 56:00.320

56:00.320 --> 56:02.320

56:16.320 --> 56:18.320

56:18.320 --> 56:20.320
