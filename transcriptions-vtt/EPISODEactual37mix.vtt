00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
Hello, one. Hello, all. Hello, y'all.

00:05.200 --> 00:09.600
It's your best friend with a trash-eating problem, Wolf the Dog.

00:09.600 --> 00:14.600
We are hitting you live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:14.600 --> 00:20.600
It is December the 6th, and the time is noon o'clock, my babies.

00:20.600 --> 00:25.900
Mmm, sounds like it's about garbage bin o'clock for y'all, Wolfy boy.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.800
Speaking of trash, earlier I took my dog, Wolf the Dog,

00:30.800 --> 00:34.300
to go find him something to fill his little belly up with.

00:34.300 --> 00:40.900
But upon venturing outside the sky, I suddenly darkened all around us for a little bit.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.100
Y'all ever seen an eclipse?

00:43.100 --> 00:46.600
It was like that, but a little different.

00:46.600 --> 00:51.400
It was real spooky, y'all. Wolf nearly shit his little old britches.

00:51.400 --> 00:55.500
Which wolf did that? I'll let y'all figure that one out.

00:55.500 --> 01:01.600
When I came back down to the studio, I found a note attached with a thumbtack to the inside of my door.

01:01.600 --> 01:05.100
It is emblazoned with a solid green triangle and says,

01:05.100 --> 01:10.100
For a wolf at the top, I guess it's this week's Howlin' with Wolf.

01:10.100 --> 01:14.200
It comes from user Chucklin' Boy over on the subreddit.

01:14.200 --> 01:19.100
He's an Android user, but logged into iTunes on his computer to leave a review.

01:19.100 --> 01:22.500
This boy sure knows how to make ol' Wolfy blush.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.400
Chucklin' Boy writes,

01:38.000 --> 01:39.700
Something fitting, isn't that?

01:39.700 --> 01:43.300
And remember, the mission is over when the world ends.

01:43.300 --> 01:46.800
For all of you out there listening, be sure to stop by the subreddit.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.800
We are starting to see more discussion around the Greater Delta Green Cannon,

01:50.800 --> 01:54.400
as well as game running tips and general show stuff.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.100
See y'all there!

01:56.100 --> 01:58.500
Wolf bless you, Chucklin' Boy.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.900
You are my fire, my one desire.

02:01.900 --> 02:06.800
Believe when I say, if you want to write a message for Wolf to read on air,

02:06.800 --> 02:11.000
tag us on Instagram or Twitter, at PretendingPod,

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.900
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg, it's time for the news.

02:21.900 --> 02:29.200
A tall, gaunt, humanoid figure with translucent skin and comically long arms asked Clark for the book.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.900
Keith shot it until it dissipated.

02:31.900 --> 02:37.400
A couple of city cops showed up to check on the shots fired at the city cemetery.

02:37.400 --> 02:44.500
John mentioned Marvin Glass and the city cops apologized and left to mind their own damn business.

02:44.500 --> 02:50.000
These heroes of ours then went to lay their fallen former co-workers to rest.

02:50.000 --> 02:57.600
Inside the tomb was a cloaked figure, an older Clark Bishop chanting from a piece of ancient parchment.

02:57.600 --> 03:05.000
The words on the paper turned to little sparks that danced around, bathing the boys in a warm light.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
Clark charged at himself, only to grab two fistfuls of cloak and bonk his head

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
smack into the wall of Ari Manstein's mausoleum, where an older version of himself just stood.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.500
Y'all, none of that made a damn lick of sense to me, but that doesn't mean I'm not hungry.

03:22.500 --> 03:28.500
Filling me up always is kudzu with no backbone.

03:40.000 --> 03:51.000
I could come close, but I'd probably forget Kansas, Illinois, Arkansas, Oklahoma, uh, uh,

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Iowa, Tennessee, Kentucky, Kentucky.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.500
One more Nebraska corner hit us up toward the top.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.000
Nebraska. Nice. Nice. Got it.

04:02.000 --> 04:09.500
I didn't know we hit the corner in Nebraska. I'm pretty proud of myself because I am traditionally terrible at geography.

04:09.500 --> 04:13.500
Hey, can you describe to me in great detail the state seal?

04:13.500 --> 04:15.000
It's two bears.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Describe, yeah, I'm just kidding.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.500
Two bears.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.500
Two bears. Okay.

04:20.500 --> 04:21.500
It's just two bears.

04:21.500 --> 04:25.500
I'm gonna hit this vape one more time and then, uh, I'll hit my vape.

04:25.500 --> 04:28.500
Well, cause yours has too much, but mine kind of dissipates real quick.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.500
Get out.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.000
If I can find it in my pocket.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.500
Get out.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.500
I'm not gonna do it.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.000
Get out.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.500
I'm sitting down.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.500
I'm making brown.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.500
Just fight your nicotine habit.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.500
I can't do it. I refuse to do it.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.500
What if I stabbed you with a mechanical pencil every time you hit your jewel?

04:45.500 --> 04:47.500
I would hire Phillip Morris to pursue you.

04:47.500 --> 04:51.500
What if you lost a sanity point every time you hit your jewel?

04:51.500 --> 04:53.500
That's dope.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.500
Okay, I'm good.

04:55.500 --> 04:59.500
Next campaign. The no vape campaign.

04:59.500 --> 05:03.500
I rolled an 87. I got that out of the way.

05:03.500 --> 05:08.500
Alright, Luke hit his jewel 365 times between the last sessions.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.500
He is insane.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.500
Certifiable.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.500
He's come back around.

05:13.500 --> 05:17.500
He's got four new characters to show off and go crazy.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.500
And go crazy and immediately die from.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.500
Okay, let's see.

05:21.500 --> 05:25.500
Dude, I was, okay, so I made a resolve not to drink as much last night

05:25.500 --> 05:31.500
cause I was listening to this episode and we were dumb.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.500
This last one?

05:32.500 --> 05:33.500
Kinda.

05:33.500 --> 05:40.500
The man in black is like, you're here with the book.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.500
And then we instantly start talking about a second you.

05:43.500 --> 05:46.500
And then we don't put it together.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.500
I was like, god damn it.

05:48.500 --> 05:49.500
Anyway.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.500
Hindsight.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.500
But I also forgot everything that happened in that episode.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.500
Good to listen back to.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.500
Good to be embarrassed by yourself.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.500
It's important.

05:59.500 --> 06:04.500
Did you see his list of pros and cons?

06:04.500 --> 06:06.500
Oh yes, incredible.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.500
Pros, the keeper's voices.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.500
Cons, the keeper's voices.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.500
Wait, what was that poster?

06:12.500 --> 06:13.500
I like that a lot.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.500
He just posted on our RPG.

06:15.500 --> 06:21.500
That one made me a chuckling boy.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.500
Welcome to the chuckle hut.

06:23.500 --> 06:24.500
Are you guys ready?

06:24.500 --> 06:25.500
Yeah, I'm ready.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.500
We'll find out.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.500
The three of you wake up.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.500
You just feel this immense pain.

06:31.500 --> 06:35.500
It's almost like a shock has just covered your entire body.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.500
Your stomach hurts.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.500
You just feel it all up in your throat.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.500
Your ears are ringing and pulsating.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.500
It's dark.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.500
It's cold here.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.500
It smells.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.500
What is that smell?

06:49.500 --> 06:51.500
It's like savory?

06:51.500 --> 06:55.500
There's a sweetness to it and your eyes begin to adjust.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.500
There's a pool of blood on the floor.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.500
The corpse of Ari Manstein is kind of in it.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.500
Her coffin is flipped over on the cold dirt.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.500
You look at each other.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.500
Blood splatter has speckled each of you.

07:08.500 --> 07:12.500
John, Kevin, Lee Pettymore all in black tactical gear.

07:12.500 --> 07:17.500
Keith Vigna in his brightly colored polo and boat shoes.

07:17.500 --> 07:24.500
Clark Bishop in an old contention PD uniform currently holding a thick black cloak.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.500
The shock begins to wear off.

07:26.500 --> 07:36.500
You feel a searing pain on your chest, on your back, on the bottom of your left foot and inside your dominant palm.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.500
Is everybody left handed?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.500
What was wounded again?

07:40.500 --> 07:42.500
Our chest, our back?

07:42.500 --> 07:44.500
Pussy and our crack?

07:44.500 --> 07:46.500
Yes, all four.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.500
It is the chest, the back, the left foot and inside your dominant palm.

07:50.500 --> 07:54.500
I would assume you're all right handed unless you've specified otherwise.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.500
John Lee Pettymore kind of seems like he would be left handed.

07:57.500 --> 08:00.500
Did it change when you went into Kevin?

08:00.500 --> 08:02.500
You're ambidextrous I think.

08:02.500 --> 08:08.500
It's the brain not the body so your brain wouldn't switch handedness I don't think.

08:08.500 --> 08:13.500
So Kevin was left handed so now you've got a really weak right hand.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.500
Right, he hasn't built up the fucking muscles.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.500
Damn dude, I know how to solve that.

08:18.500 --> 08:23.500
It's a lot easier to be right handed like everyone in the world.

08:23.500 --> 08:27.500
Literally every person except for liars.

08:27.500 --> 08:32.500
If you had trouble learning to write growing up it's because you're a liar.

08:32.500 --> 08:39.500
My mom is left handed like a liar and she always put the pencil in my left hand when I was growing up.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.500
To try to make you left handed?

08:41.500 --> 08:42.500
Be like me son.

08:42.500 --> 08:48.500
My dad's left handed and he went to Catholic school and part of their thing was trying to make kids right handed who were left handed.

08:48.500 --> 08:53.500
He also broke his arm when he was a really young kid and he still remained left handed.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.500
He said that is how strongly it took to him.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.500
The Catholics, they can instill some stuff.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.500
But not handedness apparently.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.500
No.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.500
Okay sorry.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.500
Chest, back, left foot, dominant hand?

09:05.500 --> 09:06.500
Yes sir.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.500
You said the palm.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.500
Yes inside the palm.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.500
Can I look at my palm?

09:09.500 --> 09:14.500
When you look in your palm there are letters burned into your hand.

09:14.500 --> 09:19.500
It says T-I-L-D-E.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.500
Tilde.

09:21.500 --> 09:24.500
That's in Keith's hand?

09:24.500 --> 09:26.500
That's in all three of your hands.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.500
Okay. Do you boys have Tilde written in your hands?

09:28.500 --> 09:29.500
I do.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.500
Does it look burned in? Is that what you said?

09:31.500 --> 09:32.500
Burned.

09:32.500 --> 09:33.500
Yeah.

09:33.500 --> 09:38.500
I think I would want to check what our backs say but I mean I'm looking at my hand and

09:38.500 --> 09:41.500
then I'm looking in front of me and do I still see old Clark?

09:41.500 --> 09:42.500
He's holding the robe.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.500
I shake out the robe.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.500
Nice.

09:45.500 --> 09:48.500
Does anything come out?

09:48.500 --> 09:49.500
His depends.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.500
Yeah.

09:50.500 --> 09:54.500
God.

09:54.500 --> 10:01.500
He's a great sorcerer but he's fully incontinent.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.500
Smells like real estate agent.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.500
That we made shit his pants.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.500
Okay so yeah.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.500
This takes me back.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.500
Yeah.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.500
Boys my back is burning.

10:11.500 --> 10:12.500
Is there something written?

10:12.500 --> 10:13.500
Mine too.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.500
My foot.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.500
Here.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.500
I'll check your back while I take my shoe off and you check my foot.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.500
And we play Twister.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.500
Keith struggles to rip his way too tight polo off.

10:23.500 --> 10:30.500
It hurts really badly as you pull off your way too tight polo as the polos texture moves

10:30.500 --> 10:34.500
across the burned skin on your chest and on your back.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.500
Ow.

10:35.500 --> 10:46.500
And you all see that on each of your chests burned in are the letters M-A-R-V-I-N.

10:46.500 --> 10:52.500
On your back it says D-R-E-W.

10:52.500 --> 11:02.500
And on the bottom of each of your left feet it says M-A-G-G-I-E.

11:02.500 --> 11:08.500
Clark the bottom of your left foot when you look at it, it also has this very distinct

11:08.500 --> 11:11.500
lack of skin, a discoloration.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.500
What do you mean?

11:12.500 --> 11:13.500
Like it's translucent?

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
No like this skin has been eaten away.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.500
Okay.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.500
Is it black?

11:17.500 --> 11:18.500
Yeah.

11:18.500 --> 11:19.500
And what's it in the shape of?

11:19.500 --> 11:23.500
A circle with six smaller circles.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.500
Okay.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.500
Surrounding it.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.500
That's only on Clark's foot?

11:26.500 --> 11:27.500
Yes it is.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.500
Gotcha.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.500
Do these burns look like the behold a fool brand?

11:30.500 --> 11:31.500
They do not.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.500
Okay.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.500
These look much cleaner.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.500
Okay.

11:34.500 --> 11:41.500
I need everyone to roll a sanity check for me.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.500
23 but I still failed.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.500
Oh shit.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.500
I crit fail with an 88.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.500
Wonderful.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.500
Thomas?

11:51.500 --> 11:52.500
84.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.500
All three of you lose one sanity.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.500
Let's see where that puts you each.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.500
That puts me at 19.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.500
That puts me at 18 which is also my breaking point.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.500
I'm at 11.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.500
My breaking point is 8.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.500
All right.

12:01.500 --> 12:08.500
So what we have here is a new breaking point for Clark Bishop, a new breaking point that

12:08.500 --> 12:13.660
is going into effect now for John Lee Pettymore that he broke into on the last episode or

12:13.660 --> 12:15.900
two episodes ago.

12:15.900 --> 12:20.740
And then fittingly John Lee Pettymore as well as Clark Bishop both rolled over their power

12:20.740 --> 12:23.020
so we'll see what that does moving forward.

12:23.020 --> 12:29.340
What we're going to do for this third and final breaking point for each of you, you're

12:29.340 --> 12:35.060
going to roll a D100 on the Call of Cthulhu 7th edition manias table.

12:35.060 --> 12:38.120
We're going to roll it three times and then choose.

12:38.120 --> 12:40.920
You can choose which mania you want to take.

12:40.920 --> 12:41.920
Okay.

12:41.920 --> 12:47.960
Thomas, go ahead and roll up some numbers for me.

12:47.960 --> 12:53.760
61, 62, and 51.

12:53.760 --> 12:54.760
All right.

12:54.760 --> 13:00.120
61, Kleptomania, the irrational compulsion for stealing.

13:00.120 --> 13:09.960
62, oh boy, Ligeromania, L-I-G-Y-R-O, mania, uncontrollable compulsion to make loud or

13:09.960 --> 13:11.200
shrill noises.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.200
I really don't.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.200
Please don't do that one.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.960
I really suggest.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.000
That one's called The Listener's Delight.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.320
I really suggest you don't choose that one.

13:21.320 --> 13:26.460
He somehow went down to zero Patreon subscribers.

13:26.460 --> 13:31.380
Another podcast was chugging along just fine and then all of a sudden it tanked.

13:31.380 --> 13:36.340
That asshole Thomas tried to go all Michael Winslow.

13:36.340 --> 13:38.580
And did you roll 51 or 52?

13:38.580 --> 13:39.580
51.

13:39.580 --> 13:47.780
51 is Gymnomania, G-Y-M-N-O mania, which is a compulsion with nudity.

13:47.780 --> 13:48.780
A compulsion with nudity?

13:48.780 --> 13:50.100
Like it has to be nude?

13:50.100 --> 13:51.100
It says with nudity.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.100
With nudity.

13:52.100 --> 13:53.100
Yeah.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.140
I'm going to just take the stealing one.

13:55.140 --> 13:56.140
Yeah.

13:56.820 --> 13:58.820
That's like the most useful in an RPG.

13:58.820 --> 13:59.820
That absolutely makes sense.

13:59.820 --> 14:03.820
John Lee Pettymore, John Kevin Lee Pettymore, now a kleptomaniac.

14:03.820 --> 14:07.820
Joe, do you want to roll three times for me on this table here?

14:07.820 --> 14:08.820
Sure.

14:08.820 --> 14:09.820
Let's see what you got.

14:09.820 --> 14:10.820
A 30.

14:10.820 --> 14:11.820
Okay.

14:11.820 --> 14:12.820
A 94.

14:12.820 --> 14:13.820
Okay.

14:13.820 --> 14:14.820
A 92.

14:14.820 --> 14:21.820
I'm not using these dice for the rest of the night.

14:22.500 --> 14:27.500
Or you get hot it all out.

14:27.500 --> 14:34.500
A 30 is Colromania, C-O-U-L-R-O mania, it's an obsession with clowns.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.500
Okay.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
Interesting.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.500
A 92, you said?

14:38.500 --> 14:39.500
No, what was it?

14:39.500 --> 14:40.500
94?

14:40.500 --> 14:41.500
Uh-huh.

14:41.500 --> 14:47.020
94, Theomania, belief that he or she is a god.

14:48.020 --> 14:52.020
Might actually make some sense here.

14:52.020 --> 14:53.020
Interesting.

14:53.020 --> 14:55.020
And what was the third number?

14:55.020 --> 14:56.020
94?

14:56.020 --> 14:59.020
The 94 was the belief in god.

14:59.020 --> 15:00.020
Belief in god.

15:00.020 --> 15:01.020
Oh, 30.

15:01.020 --> 15:02.020
Nope.

15:02.020 --> 15:03.020
We did that one already.

15:03.020 --> 15:04.020
Okay, the 92.

15:04.020 --> 15:08.020
92, Technomania, an obsession with new technology.

15:08.020 --> 15:10.020
I think I got to take the god one.

15:10.020 --> 15:11.020
I think so.

15:11.020 --> 15:13.020
That's the dopest one.

15:13.020 --> 15:15.020
That seems obvious.

15:15.020 --> 15:16.020
Read the phrasing on it one more time.

15:17.020 --> 15:19.020
Belief that he is a god.

15:19.020 --> 15:20.020
That's what I thought.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.020
Yep, pretty straightforward.

15:22.020 --> 15:30.020
Those are going to dictate your actions, dictate not so much, but help push you with new objectives

15:30.020 --> 15:31.020
and persuasions.

15:31.020 --> 15:33.020
Oh, shit.

15:33.020 --> 15:42.020
The three of you are in this still black crypt, pure darkness, and there is the corpse of

15:42.020 --> 15:47.020
Ari Manstein, there is the coffin flipped over, and then you know that outside of this

15:47.020 --> 15:52.020
tomb are still the three android men, their corpses are out there.

15:52.020 --> 15:53.020
What would you like to do?

15:53.020 --> 15:57.020
Clark rushes Kevin and I'm trying to tackle Kevin.

15:57.020 --> 15:58.020
Alright.

15:58.020 --> 16:02.020
If the two of you could roll unarmed combat against each other to see who gets the upper

16:02.020 --> 16:03.020
hand.

16:03.020 --> 16:07.020
Can I roll firearms to see if I can shoot him first?

16:07.020 --> 16:08.020
Yeah.

16:08.020 --> 16:11.020
Is he rolling against my unarmed for that?

16:11.020 --> 16:16.020
I got a 41 on a 70.

16:16.020 --> 16:21.020
I got a 56 on a 60.

16:21.020 --> 16:24.020
Alrighty, Thomas rolled a d10 for damage.

16:24.020 --> 16:25.020
Six.

16:25.020 --> 16:32.020
As Clark Bishop starts getting up, cloak in hand, he runs toward John Lee Pettymore.

16:32.020 --> 16:34.020
I'm screaming as I'm running toward him.

16:34.020 --> 16:38.020
I mean, I'm just guttural yelling as I charge you.

16:38.020 --> 16:42.020
Can I hear what that's like to put me in?

16:42.020 --> 16:48.020
Okay, that spooks me, so I draw my pistol and fire and shoot him in the thigh.

16:48.020 --> 16:51.020
God damn it, Kevin, you told me about that.

16:51.020 --> 16:52.020
It was old me.

16:52.020 --> 16:53.020
I saw old me.

16:53.020 --> 16:54.020
Who are you?

16:54.020 --> 16:55.020
Why couldn't you warn me about that?

16:55.020 --> 16:56.020
Who are you?

16:56.020 --> 16:58.020
Why are you trying to attack me?

16:58.020 --> 17:00.020
God damn it.

17:00.020 --> 17:04.020
And I start to feel the blood pooling from the side of my hip.

17:04.020 --> 17:09.020
I see shots fired and it's this dimly lit place, but I see the big loud flashing of

17:09.020 --> 17:10.020
the muzzle of the gun.

17:10.020 --> 17:13.020
All three of you can't hear anything anymore.

17:13.020 --> 17:15.020
Your ears are ringing.

17:15.020 --> 17:18.020
Tinnitus is on the verge of happening.

17:18.020 --> 17:25.020
I rush over to Clark and try to apply first aid to his.

17:25.020 --> 17:28.020
Roll first aid for me.

17:28.020 --> 17:30.020
That's a 37 on a 60.

17:30.020 --> 17:33.020
Roll a d4 and tell me what you're doing.

17:33.020 --> 17:36.020
Applying pressure with a one.

17:36.020 --> 17:37.020
A one.

17:37.020 --> 17:42.020
You apply a one hit point amount of pressure to the wound, stopping the bleeding.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.020
Cool.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.020
That's what's important here.

17:44.020 --> 17:46.020
I am at 13 hit points.

17:46.020 --> 17:49.020
As I'm holding Clark's leg, I look at both of them.

17:49.020 --> 17:51.020
I'm like, why are you fighting?

17:51.020 --> 17:53.020
What is happening?

17:53.020 --> 17:56.020
I look at Kevin, or Kevin John.

17:56.020 --> 17:58.020
I don't, I'm sorry.

17:58.020 --> 18:02.020
I just, it just freaked me out.

18:02.020 --> 18:04.020
I just, I'm sorry.

18:04.020 --> 18:10.020
I look up at Kevin John and I just have a look in my, on my face of like, what the fuck?

18:10.020 --> 18:13.020
Like John is just looking down at his body in confusion.

18:13.020 --> 18:17.020
Guys, what the, what the fuck did we just see?

18:17.020 --> 18:19.020
I mean, we're all burnt up.

18:19.020 --> 18:22.020
We got Tildy, Maggie, Marvin.

18:22.020 --> 18:23.020
Tildy.

18:23.020 --> 18:24.020
Oh shit.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.020
Oh, hey Clark.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.020
Oh fuck.

18:26.020 --> 18:27.020
I'm sorry, brother.

18:27.020 --> 18:28.020
I remember now.

18:29.020 --> 18:32.020
It seems like I failed a sanity check or something, but I'm sorry.

18:32.020 --> 18:34.020
I'm awful sorry for shooting you in the leg.

18:34.020 --> 18:36.020
We ought to solve this Tildy thing.

18:36.020 --> 18:37.020
I shouldn't, I shouldn't have startled you.

18:37.020 --> 18:38.020
I'm sorry, John.

18:38.020 --> 18:41.020
Well, you know how I am when I get startled.

18:41.020 --> 18:44.020
I just, I deserve to be shot real hard in the hip there.

18:44.020 --> 18:49.020
That, that made sense.

18:49.020 --> 18:54.020
The most forgiving role-playing character that has ever existed.

18:54.020 --> 18:57.020
Remember you think you're a God now.

18:57.020 --> 19:01.020
Keith stands up and opens the door to the mausoleum to let some light in here and to

19:01.020 --> 19:02.020
get some fresh air.

19:02.020 --> 19:09.020
Fresh air pours in, specifically shining a nice light on the corpse of your fallen coworker.

19:09.020 --> 19:15.020
I go over to Ari's body and kind of look at both my fellow officers and start trying to

19:15.020 --> 19:18.020
get her back into the coffin.

19:18.020 --> 19:23.020
That way we can just leave here without feeling guilty and go fucking figure some shit out.

19:23.020 --> 19:27.020
As you grab the lifter, the burn on your dominant hand just hurts.

19:27.020 --> 19:29.020
So like an open wound.

19:29.020 --> 19:32.020
So extremely painful when you go to grab her.

19:32.020 --> 19:35.020
Try kicking her with the foot that weren't burned.

19:35.020 --> 19:41.020
I just power through the pain of it and lift her up into the coffin, shut the coffin.

19:41.020 --> 19:44.020
And I think where it's laying right here, it's good enough.

19:44.020 --> 19:46.020
Nobody else needs to come into this mausoleum anyway.

19:46.020 --> 19:50.020
So Clark is going to limp over back to the cloak and I'm going to pick it up and wrap it

19:50.020 --> 19:53.020
around my waist as a giant makeshift bandage.

19:53.020 --> 19:54.020
Absolutely.

19:54.020 --> 19:58.020
Was there a book that old Clark was reading out of?

19:58.020 --> 20:01.020
He had a piece of parchment that he was reading off of.

20:01.020 --> 20:03.020
Is that anywhere around here?

20:03.020 --> 20:07.020
You kind of saw it as he was chanting.

20:07.020 --> 20:13.020
You saw the page kind of burn up and then turn into these lights that danced around you.

20:13.020 --> 20:16.020
Any of you guys see, I guess, what the words were?

20:16.020 --> 20:18.020
What the hell did he do?

20:18.020 --> 20:22.020
I think maybe the words are on us now.

20:22.020 --> 20:27.020
What does Tildy, Marvin, Drew and Maggie, what do they have in common?

20:27.020 --> 20:29.020
Other than we all know them.

20:29.020 --> 20:33.020
This is what old Clark is trying to emphasize to us.

20:33.020 --> 20:37.020
These might be the four keys to what's going on here, these people.

20:37.020 --> 20:40.020
Do you think their locations on our bodies mean anything?

20:40.020 --> 20:43.020
If they do, I don't know what it is right now.

20:43.020 --> 20:44.020
We can try to figure that out.

20:44.020 --> 20:47.020
Drew is a pain in my back.

20:47.020 --> 20:53.020
Well...

20:53.020 --> 21:00.020
We thought Maggie was six feet under.

21:00.020 --> 21:04.020
Keith, you saw Maggie, her body missing a foot, right?

21:04.020 --> 21:06.020
That's true, yeah.

21:06.020 --> 21:08.020
That makes sense.

21:08.020 --> 21:16.020
I don't know what the others would mean, but we have gotten so distracted in the past 40 minutes.

21:16.020 --> 21:19.020
Do you guys still want to go with this plan for Marvin Glass?

21:19.020 --> 21:23.020
I mean, yeah, I think we should still try to call those guys.

21:23.020 --> 21:26.020
I've got this handy wound here that makes it look like you guys shot me.

21:26.020 --> 21:28.020
That's true.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.020
Does it look like you guys shot me?

21:30.020 --> 21:31.020
You're an even better Chewbacca.

21:31.020 --> 21:33.020
I mean, it doesn't make it look like we shot you.

21:33.020 --> 21:37.020
It literally is because he did.

21:37.020 --> 21:42.020
What if we need to make these people eat these parts of themselves?

21:42.020 --> 21:44.020
Let's focus less on that right now.

21:44.020 --> 21:46.020
Do you have a better theory?

21:46.020 --> 21:50.020
I don't have a better theory, but I think we ought to stick to the plan.

21:50.020 --> 21:54.020
You don't think we need to make Tilde eat her palm and Marvin eat his chest and Drew eat his back and Maggie eat her other foot?

21:54.020 --> 21:56.020
Well, I don't know where Tilde is, so...

21:56.020 --> 22:04.020
Unless you have better suggestions, I say we get back to the police car as we were going to before we ran into the cops,

22:04.020 --> 22:08.020
ran into this crazy fucking long-arm beast.

22:08.020 --> 22:10.020
Let's get in the car.

22:10.020 --> 22:11.020
Beast, you beast!

22:11.020 --> 22:21.020
Give these FBI or not people a call and drive over to Marvin's and try to get some shit figured out before we fucking kill each other.

22:21.020 --> 22:24.020
You can do whatever you want to once we get there.

22:24.020 --> 22:27.020
Well, no, you can't. We do this teamwork.

22:27.020 --> 22:31.020
We can talk about it on the car ride, but we do need a game plan.

22:31.020 --> 22:34.020
Say it all goes off without a hitch and we're in, then what?

22:34.020 --> 22:39.020
How about we get to the car first, get out of this fucking cemetery. How about that? Let's do that.

22:39.020 --> 22:42.020
And I just turn heel and I walk out of the mausoleum.

22:42.020 --> 22:44.020
I start limping out behind him.

22:44.020 --> 22:51.020
You all limp out as the bottom of your left foot hurts so fucking bad with every step that you take,

22:51.020 --> 23:00.020
and you limp past these three dead android dudes and you keep moving through these crypts, these above-ground tombs,

23:00.020 --> 23:08.020
these mausoleums of the city cemetery, and you make your way to the parking lot where there are only two cars present.

23:08.020 --> 23:17.020
Keith Vigna's contention police department cruiser and Clark Bishop's silver Honda Accord provided by the Circle of Knowledge.

23:17.020 --> 23:21.020
Do you have anything in your car you need to get out before we head on out?

23:21.020 --> 23:26.020
Let me check. Anything in that car? I'll open up the glove box.

23:26.020 --> 23:31.020
Yeah, as long as you brought your guns and your couple phones with you, then you're good to go.

23:31.020 --> 23:33.020
It's all on my person.

23:33.020 --> 23:38.020
Let me make a stop by the city free clinic real quick and see if we can't get patched up by Sawbones.

23:38.020 --> 23:40.020
They might ask us why we all have...

23:40.020 --> 23:43.020
That's why we go to the free clinic, not the emergency room.

23:43.020 --> 23:49.020
Well, you do have the best drive, so I assume you're going to be driving and you can take a pit stop if you want.

23:49.020 --> 23:52.020
And then he looks at me and he's like, what the fuck does that mean?

23:52.020 --> 23:54.020
You're the best driver, is what I meant to say.

23:54.020 --> 23:58.020
I'm hurt pretty bad, fellas. It wouldn't bother me at all.

23:58.020 --> 24:00.020
Okay, let's do that then.

24:04.020 --> 24:06.020
Hey, watch out!

24:17.020 --> 24:25.020
Welcome to the city free clinic where all your troubles are hurts.

24:28.020 --> 24:30.020
Want to take another pass at that?

24:30.020 --> 24:37.020
Welcome to the free clinic in the city where all your free troubles are taken care of by the pain that stops.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.020
Seems like something's been lost in translation.

24:42.020 --> 24:47.020
I go up to the front counter and I'm like, hey, my buddy's hurt and I got a burn on my foot. Can you help me?

24:47.020 --> 24:49.020
Yeah, of course, we can help you.

24:49.020 --> 24:53.020
And I'm about five points shy of normal myself, if you know what I mean, so...

24:53.020 --> 24:58.020
Yeah, sure, go ahead and fill out these forms and wait in the waiting room until we call your names.

24:58.020 --> 25:02.020
I put down Rex Thrasher for my name.

25:02.020 --> 25:03.020
Very cool name.

25:03.020 --> 25:05.020
I put in Peter Deeter for my name.

25:05.020 --> 25:10.020
Clark writes down Clark Bishop and then looks at your guys' sheets and then just crosses it out.

25:13.020 --> 25:15.020
And he writes down...

25:15.020 --> 25:17.020
Clark Chisup.

25:19.020 --> 25:24.020
He writes down Chaz Fauntleroy.

25:25.020 --> 25:27.020
Chaz Fauntleroy.

25:27.020 --> 25:29.020
Lil Chaz Fauntleroy.

25:31.020 --> 25:35.020
Okay, let's roll a bureaucracy check.

25:35.020 --> 25:36.020
Oh!

25:36.020 --> 25:37.020
Hell yeah.

25:37.020 --> 25:38.020
I happen to have some of that.

25:38.020 --> 25:39.020
I have some of that too.

25:39.020 --> 25:40.020
I have 50 bureaucracy.

25:40.020 --> 25:41.020
I got 30.

25:41.020 --> 25:50.020
Okay, so here's what I'm going to do. Whoever has the highest is going to roll, but the other two can roll to assist in this since you're all together.

25:50.020 --> 25:55.020
For each success, I'll give a plus 10% bump to whoever's got the highest.

25:55.020 --> 25:56.020
I've got a 40.

25:56.020 --> 25:57.020
I have 50.

25:57.020 --> 25:58.020
30.

25:58.020 --> 25:59.020
I rolled a 16.

25:59.020 --> 26:00.020
Hell yeah.

26:00.020 --> 26:01.020
So we don't need it, right?

26:01.020 --> 26:02.020
Oh yeah, you don't need it.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.020
Yeah, you just take care of business.

26:04.020 --> 26:11.020
And sir, what is the format on which the payment will go through on the forms?

26:11.020 --> 26:14.020
If you bill it to the First Church of Contention.

26:14.020 --> 26:16.020
Oh yeah, absolutely. They have an account with us.

26:16.020 --> 26:18.020
Thank you so much for coming in.

26:18.020 --> 26:23.020
Everyone roll a D4 and gain that many hit points back.

26:23.020 --> 26:24.020
Where's that one I handed?

26:24.020 --> 26:25.020
Oh, there it goes back to you.

26:25.020 --> 26:26.020
Four!

26:26.020 --> 26:27.020
Woo!

26:27.020 --> 26:28.020
Three!

26:28.020 --> 26:29.020
Woo!

26:29.020 --> 26:30.020
Three, but I only need one to get back up to max.

26:30.020 --> 26:32.020
Give one to Joe.

26:32.020 --> 26:33.020
Two.

26:33.020 --> 26:35.020
That puts me at a 16.

26:35.020 --> 26:36.020
I'm at 19.

26:36.020 --> 26:37.020
I'm at 25.

26:37.020 --> 26:40.020
You guys roll out back to the parking lot feeling much better.

26:40.020 --> 26:43.020
It's 2 p.m. The sun is high in the sky on December 6th.

26:43.020 --> 26:46.020
It's still a pretty cold day here in the city.

26:46.020 --> 26:47.020
Which cars did you bring both of them?

26:47.020 --> 26:49.020
I think we all hopped into the PD car.

26:49.020 --> 26:51.020
Oh, that's right. I was there.

26:51.020 --> 26:53.020
So, what would you like to do?

26:53.020 --> 26:54.020
Okay.

26:54.020 --> 26:55.020
It's time to Chewbacca it.

26:55.020 --> 26:56.020
We're gonna go.

26:56.020 --> 27:00.020
You guys were gonna call while you went to Jim Cook's house to go look at the book?

27:00.020 --> 27:03.020
Oh, that's right. We're gonna go to the book and then go to Marvin's. That's right.

27:03.020 --> 27:10.020
So, we call the FBI in quotation marks.

27:10.020 --> 27:14.020
I was just waiting for Taylor to finish ringing.

27:14.020 --> 27:20.020
You hear the click and then you hear an automated voice say,

27:20.020 --> 27:27.020
Thank you for calling. For prompt service, please identify yourself and any associates.

27:27.020 --> 27:32.020
Keith Vigna, Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore III.

27:32.020 --> 27:35.020
Thank you. Has the incursion been stopped?

27:35.020 --> 27:36.020
No.

27:36.020 --> 27:39.020
Thank you. Has the incident been covered up?

27:39.020 --> 27:41.020
Yes.

27:41.020 --> 27:43.020
Thank you. Is that all?

27:43.020 --> 27:47.020
No, but I would like to talk to someone about it.

27:47.020 --> 27:49.020
Thank you. Is that all?

27:49.020 --> 27:57.020
I have nothing else to say to a robot. I would like to talk to the officers that I talked to a couple of days ago.

27:57.020 --> 27:59.020
Thank you. Is that all?

27:59.020 --> 28:01.020
Yes.

28:01.020 --> 28:02.020
Thank you.

28:02.020 --> 28:04.020
And the line goes dead.

28:04.020 --> 28:07.020
Yeah, that robot wasn't really in a negotiating mood.

28:07.020 --> 28:08.020
Not really.

28:08.020 --> 28:11.020
We learned precisely jack shit from that.

28:11.020 --> 28:12.020
Fuck.

28:12.020 --> 28:14.020
Can I go pee real quick?

28:14.020 --> 28:19.020
Just piss your pants, Luke. I mean, they are yellow.

28:19.020 --> 28:23.020
You can see a picture of Luke's pants on the Instagram page at PretendingPod.

28:23.020 --> 28:25.020
I peed my pants.

28:25.020 --> 28:28.020
You can see an after picture after he peed his pants.

28:28.020 --> 28:29.020
Only on Instagram.

28:29.020 --> 28:30.020
Only on Instagram.

28:30.020 --> 28:31.020
And they got more yellow.

28:31.020 --> 28:32.020
I'll put it on Twitter too.

28:32.020 --> 28:36.020
So real fast on my breaking point that I just hit, does that take effect now?

28:36.020 --> 28:39.020
We'll go ahead and just say like it'll take effect now.

28:39.020 --> 28:41.020
I know that you like role playing wise, like.

28:41.020 --> 28:45.020
Because we usually, it was when we went to bed, so I wasn't playing it too hard just now.

28:45.020 --> 28:46.020
Sure, yeah.

28:46.020 --> 28:50.020
You can just evolve into your character from here as you move forward.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.020
Okay.

28:51.020 --> 28:57.020
And then actually I said earlier that that was your final breaking point, but what was your sanity at when you hit that?

28:57.020 --> 29:01.020
So I'm now at 18, so that makes me go down, so my next breaking point will be at 6.

29:01.020 --> 29:06.020
At 6, so you'll gain another disorder at 6 sanity points.

29:06.020 --> 29:09.020
As well as Thomas, when you hit your breaking point, what were you at?

29:09.020 --> 29:10.020
I'm at 18 right now.

29:10.020 --> 29:11.020
Gotcha.

29:11.020 --> 29:12.020
And what's your power?

29:12.020 --> 29:13.020
Power is 12.

29:13.020 --> 29:16.020
Right, so then you'll also have another breaking point at 6.

29:16.020 --> 29:17.020
Right, yeah.

29:17.020 --> 29:18.020
Well now mine's at.

29:18.020 --> 29:19.020
Oh, from earlier.

29:19.020 --> 29:20.020
From earlier, yeah.

29:20.020 --> 29:21.020
Sure.

29:21.020 --> 29:22.020
I think it's 7.

29:22.020 --> 29:23.020
Okay, cool.

29:23.020 --> 29:27.020
So your next breaking point will be at 7, and then Luke just has one breaking point left.

29:27.020 --> 29:30.020
Yeah, my next one is at 8, so after that I'll be bing bong.

29:30.020 --> 29:32.020
I'll be a bing bong boy.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.020
You'll go insane forever.

29:33.020 --> 29:36.020
To join the ranks of all my other characters.

29:36.020 --> 29:38.020
Have we ever talked about regaining sanity?

29:38.020 --> 29:39.020
Can you do that in this game?

29:39.020 --> 29:43.020
You know, there is a mechanic in Delta Green for regaining sanity.

29:43.020 --> 29:45.020
Oh, it's going to the therapist, right?

29:45.020 --> 29:46.020
It is, yeah.

29:46.020 --> 29:47.020
So there's a couple ways that you can do it.

29:47.020 --> 29:48.020
Oh, yeah.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.020
Because we did that in one of the wonderful campaigns.

29:49.020 --> 29:53.020
Yeah, when we had a campaign where we were doing shorter scenarios.

29:53.020 --> 29:58.020
Shorter scenarios with home scenes in between is how you traditionally play Delta Green,

29:58.020 --> 30:02.020
but I have given you guys no downtime in this campaign whatsoever.

30:02.020 --> 30:07.020
And downtime is normally when you would bump stats, train new stats.

30:07.020 --> 30:12.020
You might reconnect with your family, go to the therapist, any of those things.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.020
We haven't done any of that.

30:13.020 --> 30:17.020
We'll maybe try it on the next campaign to add that back in,

30:17.020 --> 30:19.020
but for this one we're not going to worry about it.

30:19.020 --> 30:24.020
And then as far as gaining sanity besides going to the therapist,

30:24.020 --> 30:30.020
in a lot of Delta Green scenarios, at the end there will be bonuses for sanity.

30:30.020 --> 30:35.020
If you take out a threat or whatever, then you can gain sanity back.

30:35.020 --> 30:40.020
I'm all for that, but you guys have only done things that would lose sanity.

30:40.020 --> 30:41.020
Right.

30:41.020 --> 30:48.020
This campaign's not really meant to make you guys feel better in any way.

30:48.020 --> 30:49.020
All right, cool.

30:49.020 --> 30:51.020
So what is the plan?

30:51.020 --> 30:53.020
You guys called and you were on your way.

30:53.020 --> 30:56.020
We just got ourselves fixed up at the free clinic.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.020
Yeah, we called.

30:57.020 --> 30:58.020
Didn't get to talk to anybody.

30:58.020 --> 30:59.020
Yep.

30:59.020 --> 31:02.020
Although you told them that we wanted to talk to them and they said okay.

31:02.020 --> 31:03.020
Right.

31:03.020 --> 31:07.020
So I suppose that we will wait for a callback from them.

31:07.020 --> 31:09.020
They'll probably call any minute.

31:09.020 --> 31:11.020
I'm sure they will.

31:11.020 --> 31:15.020
So John, I think you're going to be driving us to Jim's house.

31:15.020 --> 31:16.020
All right.

31:16.020 --> 31:22.020
While we're there, I want to tell you that we in the real world got these little notebooks from Joe,

31:22.020 --> 31:25.020
which have fun Missouri facts on the back of them,

31:25.020 --> 31:30.020
and they list one of our five primary crops as forage, and none of us knew what that was,

31:30.020 --> 31:36.020
so I looked it up, and forage are crops grown specifically to be grazed by livestock or consumed as hay.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.020
That was my guess.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.020
Oh, that makes sense.

31:38.020 --> 31:39.020
Makes sense.

31:39.020 --> 31:42.020
It doesn't have to go on air, but I just looked it up and I wanted to tell you guys now.

31:42.020 --> 31:45.020
To keep that methane pumping, baby.

31:45.020 --> 31:49.020
We're an edutainment podcast now, technically speaking.

31:49.020 --> 31:57.020
This is actually, there's going to be a pretty heavy shift towards Missouri agriculture facts in the coming weeks.

31:57.020 --> 32:01.020
Which might prove controversial to some listeners, but...

32:01.020 --> 32:07.020
If you didn't know, Kansas City is the largest city in Missouri, followed by St. Louis, followed by Springfield.

32:07.020 --> 32:08.020
What?

32:08.020 --> 32:13.020
But 66% of Missouri is covered in farmland, so we're lucky to not be farmers.

32:13.020 --> 32:14.020
That's a pretty cool number.

32:14.020 --> 32:16.020
Your family are farmers.

32:16.020 --> 32:19.020
Dumb hillbilly farmers.

32:19.020 --> 32:23.020
Rich, dumb hillbilly farmers.

32:23.020 --> 32:26.020
You can pipe in the Missouri facts theme that we wrote here if you want.

32:26.020 --> 32:28.020
Yes, that we recorded earlier.

32:28.020 --> 32:32.020
Well, it's Missouri facts and we're going downtown.

32:32.020 --> 32:38.020
You can post the back of this on the Instagram so all our followers can get their Missouri facts.

32:38.020 --> 32:40.020
It's between our listeners.

32:40.020 --> 32:44.020
If you want to know what the state animal or insect is, check out our Instagram.

32:44.020 --> 32:46.020
Don't Google it.

32:46.020 --> 32:55.020
But for more of this campaign, keep listening right now as we stop talking about Missouri.

32:56.020 --> 33:01.020
Yeah, so the last time we decided was to go to Jim's.

33:01.020 --> 33:05.020
Yeah, we're going to Jim's, looking for that book and anything else that might be of interest over there.

33:05.020 --> 33:10.020
Clark directs you to the neighborhood that he was in earlier today, actually.

33:10.020 --> 33:17.020
And as you guys are pulling in, you see that there are flyers put up on every poll.

33:17.020 --> 33:21.020
And on each of these flyers is Clark Bishop's face.

33:21.020 --> 33:29.020
Underneath it says, Clark Bishop, call cops if seen. Say, quote, violent EDP.

33:29.020 --> 33:33.020
As cops, we know what EDP is and it means...

33:33.020 --> 33:36.020
As cops, you know that violent EDP...

33:36.020 --> 33:38.020
Oh, I don't have internet right now.

33:38.020 --> 33:40.020
Why is the wifi down?

33:40.020 --> 33:41.020
Oh, look it up.

33:41.020 --> 33:47.020
In the meantime, did you know that the state fossil is the crinoid?

33:47.020 --> 33:49.020
Emotionally disturbed person.

33:49.020 --> 33:57.020
And that's a fun one because there's a lot of road cuts in the highways and stuff out through the limestone of the Ozark Mountains.

33:57.020 --> 33:59.020
And you can go up there and just collect fossils.

33:59.020 --> 34:01.020
Crinoids, trilobites.

34:01.020 --> 34:02.020
Nice.

34:02.020 --> 34:03.020
Dinosaur bones.

34:03.020 --> 34:06.020
Thanks for that fun Missouri fact.

34:06.020 --> 34:09.020
EDP is emotionally disturbed person.

34:09.020 --> 34:10.020
That is right.

34:10.020 --> 34:11.020
And you're a violent one apparently.

34:11.020 --> 34:14.020
All of that is probably correct.

34:14.020 --> 34:23.020
You drive through and you see all these suburban homes look the exact same, but Clark does point out one that says Jim Cook on the mailbox outside.

34:23.020 --> 34:27.020
There it is.

34:27.020 --> 34:33.020
As we pull in, I see one of these and I'm like, Clark, what did you do?

34:33.020 --> 34:34.020
What are you talking about?

34:34.020 --> 34:38.020
And I point to one of the flyers on a light pole.

34:38.020 --> 34:40.020
Oh, shit.

34:40.020 --> 34:50.020
I mean, I woke up on the driveway here and there was a jogger walking around.

34:50.020 --> 34:59.020
He asked what I was doing here and I just told him I didn't know and I must have come off hanky to him or something.

34:59.020 --> 35:00.020
I don't know.

35:00.020 --> 35:03.020
But he left in a hurry after I talked to him.

35:03.020 --> 35:04.020
Did you tell him your name or?

35:04.020 --> 35:06.020
Yeah.

35:06.020 --> 35:09.020
I told him I was an officer from contention.

35:09.020 --> 35:10.020
Next time you should kill him.

35:10.020 --> 35:15.020
Keith looks down at his feet, doesn't believe what Clark just told him, but shrugs it off.

35:15.020 --> 35:18.020
I'll human what Clark just told me.

35:18.020 --> 35:21.020
Would that be against something of mine or is it just if he passes or not?

35:21.020 --> 35:31.020
You know, now that we've been rolling against each other for unarmed combat and now shooting each other, I think we could get to a point in time where you can human against each other.

35:31.020 --> 35:34.020
So, Clark, you would roll human.

35:34.020 --> 35:39.020
Or if he, like a liar, if he has a higher skill in persuade maybe, could he roll that versus my human?

35:39.020 --> 35:40.020
Oh, I like that. Yeah.

35:40.020 --> 35:41.020
Yeah.

35:41.020 --> 35:43.020
So, whatever is higher, I think.

35:43.020 --> 35:46.020
I got a 41 out of a 50 human.

35:46.020 --> 35:51.020
I'm rolling on my persuade, which is a 40, and I fail.

35:51.020 --> 35:57.020
I'm not telling you the whole truth, but I'm definitely telling you essentially what happened, but I am withholding something.

35:57.020 --> 35:59.020
You know, Vigna, trust ish him.

35:59.020 --> 36:01.020
I'm fine with that for now.

36:01.020 --> 36:03.020
Let's just get in here, get this book and-

36:03.020 --> 36:06.020
Before we go in, there's a few rules, all right?

36:06.020 --> 36:13.020
You don't step on Superman's cake, you don't spit in the wind, and god damn it, you don't mess around with Jim.

36:13.020 --> 36:14.020
Those are the rules.

36:14.020 --> 36:16.020
Do you- you must-

36:16.020 --> 36:18.020
Did you know Jim very well, Jon?

36:18.020 --> 36:20.020
It's just a song, boys. Let's go.

36:22.020 --> 36:23.020
Okay.

36:23.020 --> 36:29.020
I look at both of them, kind of roll my eyes, and then walk into Jim's house.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.020
The door is locked.

36:31.020 --> 36:33.020
I use my lock picking skill to open the door.

36:33.020 --> 36:34.020
Ooh, dope.

36:36.020 --> 36:37.020
An 11 on a 50.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.020
A crit.

36:38.020 --> 36:41.020
A crit success. Do you want to describe how quick and smooth you are?

36:41.020 --> 36:45.020
I flick the doorknob with my finger, and it just pops open.

36:49.020 --> 36:51.020
Got the Fonzie touch.

36:51.020 --> 36:59.020
It kind of hurt my fingernail, but I kind of wave it off and look back at the boys, open it up, and walk in.

36:59.020 --> 37:05.020
As you guys walk in, the house smells kind of old, but in a nice, calming, familiar way.

37:05.020 --> 37:07.020
There's an upright piano in the entry.

37:07.020 --> 37:15.020
The living room has papers and binders strewn all over the coffee table, couch, chairs, the floor, really just everywhere all over this house.

37:15.020 --> 37:22.020
The sun is shining in through the window, illuminating a fair amount of dust that is moving slowly upward.

37:22.020 --> 37:25.020
Hey Clark, do you remember where this particular book is?

37:25.020 --> 37:29.020
Clark starts walking toward where he last saw the book.

37:29.020 --> 37:38.020
Clark, as you walk toward where you last saw the book, you walk through the kitchen, you see that the picture that you saw in the fridge is still there,

37:38.020 --> 37:44.020
and sitting out on the kitchen counter are the other items that you saw when you came through here last time.

37:44.020 --> 37:51.020
And then sitting out in the living room with all the papers and binders and stuff all over the place, you see this big book.

37:51.020 --> 37:56.020
It's leather and thick, and it has a symbol on the front that you obviously have come to recognize.

37:56.020 --> 38:01.020
It's the big circle. It's the Circle of Knowledge logo surrounded by six smaller circles.

38:01.020 --> 38:10.020
And the thick leather book has a girthy wooden bookmark, and it is stuck toward the back of the book.

38:10.020 --> 38:15.020
I pick up the book, and I just kind of lift it. This is the one I was talking about.

38:15.020 --> 38:19.020
So is that bookmark, is that the only page you can open it up to?

38:19.020 --> 38:22.020
Last time, for sure. Let me see if that's still the case.

38:22.020 --> 38:23.020
It is.

38:23.020 --> 38:24.020
Let's us try to open it.

38:24.020 --> 38:28.020
Well, can you try to take the bookmark out and put it in a different page?

38:28.020 --> 38:29.020
I'll give it a shot.

38:29.020 --> 38:37.020
As you try to do that, the bookmark won't go into any other pages, and it is as if earlier said, as a magnet is almost keeping it away.

38:37.020 --> 38:40.020
What happens when Keith and John try?

38:41.020 --> 38:50.020
The three of you are all now hands and feet all in trying to pry this book open.

38:50.020 --> 38:54.020
Keith is on the floor with his feet in the air, you know, kind of tugging on it.

38:54.020 --> 38:56.020
Trying to get the boat shoe grip on there.

38:57.020 --> 39:00.020
We should see if John has any WD-40.

39:01.020 --> 39:02.020
Jim.

39:02.020 --> 39:05.020
I should see if I have any WD-40.

39:05.020 --> 39:08.020
Well, let's just take this with us.

39:08.020 --> 39:15.020
It seems, I don't really know, I mean, why are we even coming to get this in the first place? Maybe as an offering or something?

39:15.020 --> 39:19.020
Will you describe to them what they see on that page that it only opens up to?

39:19.020 --> 39:26.020
Yeah, absolutely. So this book does open up to this one specific page, and it is written all over.

39:26.020 --> 39:30.020
And over and over and over on this ancient parchment is the phrase,

39:30.020 --> 39:34.020
It is only through death that he may rise again.

39:35.020 --> 39:38.020
It, death, and he are all capitalized.

39:39.020 --> 39:49.020
And drawn over this obsessive scrawl is a picture of a hooded figure that you just saw with a brilliant light shining from its maw.

39:49.020 --> 39:55.020
So Maggie told me that this is some kind of sacred text to their circle.

39:55.020 --> 39:59.020
She called it her dad's book even, like it was maybe his personal copy or something.

39:59.020 --> 40:03.020
Well, hell, Clark, it almost sounds like they're talking about you.

40:04.020 --> 40:15.020
Well, now that I've seen the picture and I've seen me, the old me, I'm starting to wonder that maybe I'm more important to their plans than I realized.

40:16.020 --> 40:17.020
What did it say again?

40:17.020 --> 40:18.020
Only through, oh.

40:18.020 --> 40:21.020
It is only through death that he may rise again.

40:21.020 --> 40:22.020
Hey, fellas, I died.

40:23.020 --> 40:24.020
That's what I'm saying, man.

40:24.020 --> 40:25.020
Oh.

40:25.020 --> 40:28.020
And you rose again, and there's this picture in here.

40:28.020 --> 40:32.020
Just for a record, Joe didn't put that together until just now, and I got chills.

40:33.020 --> 40:36.020
It's some kind of, it's almost, it's prophetic.

40:36.020 --> 40:40.020
You could be some kind of messiah, some kind of a child of prophecy.

40:40.020 --> 40:43.020
I've been starting to believe that more and more lately.

40:45.020 --> 40:47.020
There's a manic glint in your eye when you say that.

40:48.020 --> 40:56.020
And I kind of, I look, the way that Clark said it and what I saw in his eye, I kind of start to believe it too.

40:56.020 --> 41:04.020
You also, when you're going through this, you do feel on your person you have an envelope with a letter in it that you found right here that you still have with you.

41:05.020 --> 41:07.020
What are you touching yourself for?

41:08.020 --> 41:12.020
Oh, I forgot about this, and I pull it out.

41:13.020 --> 41:20.020
Fellas, this is a, when I was trying to pry the book open to another page, this kind of flitted out of the book, and I hand it to him.

41:20.020 --> 41:33.020
It is a letter written by Jim Cook that in detail refutes, quote, the revelation of the overseer, end quote, calling it the scratches of a broken man.

41:34.020 --> 41:42.020
The letter then goes on to outline new guidelines, including the immediate reassignment of all members of the disposal unit.

41:43.020 --> 41:48.020
And at the top of the page, it says, faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.

41:48.020 --> 41:53.020
That faith through knowledge bit there, that's a, that's the motto of the circle.

41:54.020 --> 41:55.020
Oh, okay.

41:56.020 --> 41:57.020
As you guys are standing around.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.020
You escaped me the first time.

42:06.020 --> 42:11.020
Clark, do you feel like you did a pretty thorough and successful search of these papers the first time you were here?

42:12.020 --> 42:14.020
It was so thorough that there was no chance of missing anything.

42:15.020 --> 42:16.020
Excellent.

42:16.020 --> 42:17.020
Incredible.

42:18.020 --> 42:21.020
That's why you are, no, were the best cop on the force.

42:22.020 --> 42:23.020
Now it's Drew.

42:24.020 --> 42:25.020
I don't know, I think Drew might be.

42:26.020 --> 42:31.020
If we're, if we're sharing now, I laid out a couple other interesting items on the counter in the kitchen there you can take a look at.

42:32.020 --> 42:33.020
We go take a look at those.

42:34.020 --> 42:43.020
As you guys go and take a look at those, Clark Bishop, you feel a drop hit your nose, just a little wet drop hit your nose.

42:43.020 --> 42:54.020
And as it runs down to the tip of your nose, you inhale, you kind of, oh, and you snort in and it is, um, it's, it's vodka.

42:55.020 --> 42:56.020
I look up, you know, like recognize it.

42:57.020 --> 42:58.020
Oh yeah, there's a stain on the ceiling.

42:59.020 --> 43:00.020
It's pooling.

43:01.020 --> 43:08.020
You can see that the drywall is wet and hits you again, hits you again.

43:08.020 --> 43:14.020
The two of you, as you go into the kitchen, you see that there are three items sitting out on the kitchen counter.

43:15.020 --> 43:25.020
There's a Ziploc bag containing two small items, a single tarot card, the devil with several bullet holes in it, as well as a taxidermied baby squirrel.

43:26.020 --> 43:29.020
There's also a leather holster for a firearm.

43:30.020 --> 43:34.020
There isn't a gun in it, but there is a small bit of text tooled into the leather.

43:34.020 --> 43:41.020
It says scientia morse est underneath it. It says dash K uppercase K.

43:42.020 --> 43:47.020
And then there's also a ring. It's got some small little curly hairs on it.

43:48.020 --> 43:55.020
It is smooth and silver with a little plateau on top. It is completely smooth with no markings.

43:56.020 --> 43:59.020
What are the items in the, oh wait, are these all in the bag?

43:59.020 --> 44:04.020
No, it's just a taxidermied baby squirrel and the tarot card with bullet holes in it.

44:05.020 --> 44:08.020
Yes. The other two things, the leather holster and the ring are just sitting out.

44:09.020 --> 44:12.020
I walk in to join the fellows. There's vodka dripping from the ceiling.

44:13.020 --> 44:14.020
Is this a two story house?

44:15.020 --> 44:16.020
Nope. I think it was.

44:17.020 --> 44:18.020
Oh, it was.

44:19.020 --> 44:20.020
Yeah. I went upstairs to get pants. I'm pretty sure.

44:21.020 --> 44:22.020
Oh yeah. It's a two story house.

44:23.020 --> 44:24.020
Is this a two story house?

44:25.020 --> 44:28.020
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely it is.

44:29.020 --> 44:31.020
There's vodka dripping from the ceiling?

44:32.020 --> 44:36.020
Yeah. Let's go check it out.

44:37.020 --> 44:41.020
Before we go, I feel like there's a 30 percent chance that this holster belonged to Kevin. 33 percent.

44:42.020 --> 44:44.020
So I just take that and put it on my belt and get my gun.

44:45.020 --> 44:49.020
Did you find these and put them all here just cause you, what did you think?

44:50.020 --> 44:53.020
I don't really know. I kind of wondered if that squirrel was the work of Julie Maxwell.

44:54.020 --> 44:56.020
She was into taxidermy, but there's no way for me to know.

44:56.020 --> 45:03.020
As soon as I heard, as soon as I saw that it was a taxidermy squirrel, I thought of Julie Maxwell and of that hat that I put on.

45:04.020 --> 45:05.020
Well, hat.

45:06.020 --> 45:07.020
Did you try the ring on?

45:08.020 --> 45:09.020
I don't think I did.

45:10.020 --> 45:11.020
Is it big enough to fit on any of my fingers?

45:12.020 --> 45:22.020
Yeah. When you slip it on, there's a small glow on top of it on the flat part and the glow shows a small logo as you slip it on.

45:22.020 --> 45:28.020
And the logo is an M created out of four double helices.

45:29.020 --> 45:30.020
Wish I would have put that on.

45:31.020 --> 45:34.020
Do I feel any different having it on or just that happens?

45:35.020 --> 45:37.020
Nope. But now the Ringwraiths know where you are.

45:38.020 --> 45:39.020
I look around.

45:40.020 --> 45:45.020
Keith, you recognize that symbol? That was on the robot man we fought back at James's house.

45:46.020 --> 45:49.020
Pretty sure that probably has something to do with Marvin Glass, I would assume.

45:49.020 --> 45:53.020
Oh, yeah. That could be. Or Maggie.

45:54.020 --> 45:55.020
What if Maggie's making robots?

45:56.020 --> 45:58.020
What's the double helix then? Does that ring any bells?

45:59.020 --> 46:04.020
I mean, other than what we saw stamped where the penis of the robot should have been.

46:05.020 --> 46:07.020
But I mean, is that significant to Marvin or Maggie in any way?

46:08.020 --> 46:09.020
Is it M?

46:10.020 --> 46:13.020
Oh, no, no. I don't know. I'm just, I got Marvin on my mind.

46:14.020 --> 46:15.020
Just the shape of DNA. I don't know.

46:16.020 --> 46:17.020
Marvin!

46:17.020 --> 46:18.020
I had a...

46:19.020 --> 46:20.020
Marvin!

46:21.020 --> 46:23.020
Sorry, I had Marvin on my mind.

46:24.020 --> 46:25.020
God.

46:26.020 --> 46:32.020
I had previously taken one of my shoelaces off to tie around my pants to keep it up.

46:33.020 --> 46:38.020
I take the other shoelace off, slip it into the ring, and I'm wearing it around my neck now.

46:39.020 --> 46:40.020
Dope. Love it.

46:41.020 --> 46:42.020
Keith, I found that in a pile of pubes.

46:42.020 --> 46:49.020
It could... I'm going to assume that it was just squirrel hair.

46:50.020 --> 46:52.020
No, it was pubes. You might just want to wash it.

46:53.020 --> 46:54.020
Midsummer spoilers.

46:55.020 --> 46:57.020
Well, I just kind of... I kind of shake...

46:58.020 --> 47:02.020
While it's around my neck, I shake it off and hope most of the pubes come off.

47:03.020 --> 47:05.020
But at this point, there's some nice sunlight coming in through the kitchen window,

47:06.020 --> 47:09.020
and you can see the pubes kind of swirl around in a nice...

47:09.020 --> 47:11.020
And the American Beauty song starts playing.

47:12.020 --> 47:18.020
At the end of the day here, one of the least concerns I have is touching pubes at this point.

47:19.020 --> 47:21.020
When was that ever a concern for you?

47:22.020 --> 47:25.020
That vodka was dripping from the ceiling in there.

47:26.020 --> 47:28.020
I don't know much about construction of houses,

47:29.020 --> 47:32.020
but that would have to be a lot of vodka upstairs to make it drip through the ceiling, right?

47:33.020 --> 47:34.020
Let's go check that out.

47:35.020 --> 47:36.020
I'll head on up there.

47:37.020 --> 47:38.020
I follow behind him.

47:39.020 --> 47:46.020
As you're walking through, there's a couple hallways, some rooms, couple rooms, a bathroom, a closet.

47:47.020 --> 47:52.020
But you start to realize as you're walking in these doors that the vodka is spilling from a place

47:53.020 --> 47:58.020
where there isn't a room that could actually put you in that spot in the living room.

47:59.020 --> 48:03.020
Can I just put my ear to a wall that I think would lead to where that vodka would be coming from?

48:04.020 --> 48:08.020
Yeah, as you put your ear to the wall where you think the vodka would be dripping from,

48:09.020 --> 48:13.020
you actually do hear a slight static noise.

48:14.020 --> 48:18.020
But if there was a room there, it seems like it's been maybe walled off or something.

48:19.020 --> 48:20.020
Let's search for a door.

48:21.020 --> 48:25.020
Well, we either search for a door or it's not there anymore. We need to bust in through it.

48:26.020 --> 48:27.020
After we don't find a door, we can bust through it.

48:28.020 --> 48:30.020
Would tapping on the wall reveal a door if there was one?

48:31.020 --> 48:32.020
Or, you know, just a simple search rule.

48:33.020 --> 48:35.020
That's kind of what I was envisioning.

48:35.020 --> 48:40.020
With the three of you working together, let's have the two assist the one with the best search,

48:41.020 --> 48:43.020
as we did earlier with the health that was unnecessary.

48:44.020 --> 48:45.020
I've got a 40. I've got a 50.

48:46.020 --> 48:47.020
I've just got the basic 20.

48:48.020 --> 48:51.020
98. We're not going to find this door.

48:52.020 --> 48:53.020
It doesn't even, it can't get me down to 50.

48:54.020 --> 48:55.020
I could have found it with my search rule.

48:56.020 --> 48:57.020
I rolled a 13.

48:58.020 --> 49:00.020
I mean, we could have both helped him, but it's still the 78.

49:00.020 --> 49:06.020
You know full well that there is an open room on the other side of this wall, but you cannot find a door to get there.

49:07.020 --> 49:12.020
I want to use my athletics to just falcon kick this wall where there's not a stud.

49:13.020 --> 49:14.020
Roll athletics.

49:15.020 --> 49:16.020
43 on a 50.

49:17.020 --> 49:19.020
Nice. Keith's foot is stuck in the wall.

49:20.020 --> 49:22.020
I helped to pull him out.

49:23.020 --> 49:24.020
No, no, no. Push him through.

49:30.020 --> 49:48.020
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

49:49.020 --> 49:57.020
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

49:57.020 --> 50:03.020
There's no time to go.

50:04.020 --> 50:12.020
There's no time to go.
