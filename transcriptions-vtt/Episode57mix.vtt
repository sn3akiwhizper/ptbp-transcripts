00:00.000 --> 00:07.080
What's cooking my babies, it's your gumbo master wolf the dog, and I'm here on this

00:07.080 --> 00:12.400
early evening on December 6th to cook you up a fresh pot of goo.

00:12.400 --> 00:19.400
This gumbo was made with nothing but the discarded shells of river bugs, various types of blood,

00:19.400 --> 00:21.400
and celery.

00:21.400 --> 00:28.720
Mmm makes my tummy rumble just thinking about it, and my tummy is causing reverberations

00:28.720 --> 00:34.680
all throughout the galaxy live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:34.680 --> 00:40.340
Speaking of my tummy, I'm hungry for love, so you know what time it is.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.820
It's time for Howlin' with Wolf.

00:42.820 --> 00:47.040
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Eric from New York, who writes,

00:47.040 --> 00:51.420
Hello Adam, I'm glad you're enjoying the podcast so far.

00:51.420 --> 00:55.520
If you've made it to this message it means you've probably passed where I am in the

00:55.520 --> 00:56.520
story.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.600
Sorry Wolfie, I'll get listening ASAP.

00:59.600 --> 01:07.240
I hope Catherine, Phoebe, Ripley, and little baby Aurelia are doing great in Maryland.

01:07.240 --> 01:14.480
I hope baby Aurelia isn't too traumatized by this ultra-violent podcast.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.440
Love from New York, Eric.

01:16.440 --> 01:23.460
Well Eric, I would recommend you inform that baby to not stand too close to the radio when

01:23.460 --> 01:26.220
I admit my auditory secretions.

01:26.220 --> 01:33.180
I've been known to warp the minds of the young, turning them into disciples who will

01:33.180 --> 01:36.940
not stop until my power is absolute.

01:36.940 --> 01:40.640
Coochie coochie coo, my little baby babies.

01:40.640 --> 01:44.860

02:10.840 --> 02:16.240
The most recent one is a Q&A episode where Justin even showed up to help answer all the

02:16.240 --> 02:20.400
questions you fine folks asked over on the subreddit.

02:20.400 --> 02:24.820
But you don't have to even ask questions to your old wolfie because I already have

02:24.820 --> 02:29.360
the answers you seek here on the news.

02:29.360 --> 02:35.800
Last time, these overworked, underfed, and over-aggressive dumb fucks dressed up vaguely

02:35.800 --> 02:41.480
like Burt Macklin from the hit television series The National Broadcasting Company's

02:41.480 --> 02:42.480
Parks and Recreation.

02:42.480 --> 02:48.760
And then they said very few words before making it to the office of Bruce Robin, literally

02:48.760 --> 02:55.160
over the body of a stylish woman who was thriving in the city as a high-powered PA.

02:55.160 --> 02:58.040
Once inside, things did not go any better.

02:58.040 --> 03:02.480
Keith Victor claimed to be from a secret organization called Myriad.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.440
Bruce began chanting and reached for his gun.

03:05.440 --> 03:10.240
Clark Bishop dove over the table, knocking Bruce over backward in his chair and sending

03:10.240 --> 03:12.780
his handgun just out of reach.

03:12.780 --> 03:18.600
After a back-and-forth three-on-one fistfight except for the knives and guns, John Lee Kevin

03:18.600 --> 03:24.520
Moore the three-and-a-half looked away for just long enough for Bruce to finish his chant

03:24.520 --> 03:27.460
and fire his gun into his own head.

03:27.460 --> 03:32.720
Taking us now to the most happening place in the city, a fancy chief executive's penthouse

03:32.720 --> 03:38.240
office that is completely covered in a sequence of numbers I dare not repeat on these soundwaves

03:38.240 --> 03:43.180
written in the blood of the almost-billionaire Bruce Robin, it's a brand new track from your

03:43.180 --> 03:50.980
best of 2019 list's top artist, Kudzu, with the premiere of this tasty fuckin' jam, No

03:50.980 --> 03:53.300
Back Bone.

04:13.180 --> 04:25.700
Have you guys gotten all your Christmas shopping done?

04:25.700 --> 04:26.700
Not even close.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.700
Nope.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.540
And it's making me real nervous.

04:30.540 --> 04:35.380
We're coming up on that time where your friends realize how much you care about them.

04:35.380 --> 04:39.060
Joe, you're getting nervous?

04:39.060 --> 04:40.060
At this point?

04:40.060 --> 04:41.060
Yeah.

04:41.060 --> 04:42.060
Thomas is like, you don't know nervous.

04:42.060 --> 04:50.940
I don't know nervous either, which is why I do a lot of my shopping between the 22nd

04:50.940 --> 04:53.680
and 24th-ish.

04:53.680 --> 04:58.300
There was one year that I got like three things Christmas Eve and it was just fuckin' terrifying

04:58.300 --> 04:59.540
and awful.

04:59.540 --> 05:02.980
Like you received three presents on Christmas Eve and it was terrifying and awful.

05:02.980 --> 05:03.980
No.

05:03.980 --> 05:05.980
It was that I wouldn't get my gifts.

05:05.980 --> 05:06.980
Actually three ghosts.

05:06.980 --> 05:12.020
Last year I got four presents that took it away from Christmas Day and it was so disappointing.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.600
Luke, how many people do you buy presents for?

05:15.600 --> 05:17.460
My mom, my dad, and my sister.

05:17.460 --> 05:18.460
That's it?

05:18.460 --> 05:19.460
Yep.

05:19.460 --> 05:20.460
So I'm not supposed to get you anything?

05:20.460 --> 05:21.460
Is that what it is?

05:21.460 --> 05:22.460
Oh, I've gotten you guys.

05:22.460 --> 05:26.020
I have the only thing I've bought so far is for you guys.

05:26.020 --> 05:28.780
Aww.

05:28.780 --> 05:29.780
That's nice.

05:29.780 --> 05:33.980
Am I allowed to use Patreon money to get you guys Christmas gifts?

05:33.980 --> 05:36.340
No.

05:36.340 --> 05:37.340
The answer's no.

05:37.340 --> 05:39.860
That'd be a hard write off.

05:39.860 --> 05:44.420
So we were talking when we came in today before we started recording about the numbers.

05:44.420 --> 05:49.460
The Painfully Easy Cipher, I believe the episode was titled.

05:49.460 --> 05:53.180
And you guys did some work and figured out some of the...

05:53.180 --> 05:54.180
Translations.

05:54.180 --> 05:55.180
Translations.

05:55.180 --> 05:59.780
Even for some of the past numbers that have been in this show.

05:59.780 --> 06:03.140
Do you guys want to give a rundown of where you're at on that?

06:03.140 --> 06:05.580
I did most of the work so I'll take this.

06:05.580 --> 06:09.620
Yeah, what do you got written down, Joe?

06:09.620 --> 06:15.340
Well, so it turned out to be a pretty simple, I think they call it an alphabet cipher?

06:15.340 --> 06:16.340
Is that what they call it?

06:16.340 --> 06:17.340
A substitution cipher.

06:17.340 --> 06:18.340
A substitution cipher.

06:18.340 --> 06:23.220
So the first ones in the apartment that was kind of ransacked and shitty we think say

06:23.220 --> 06:28.900
Harriet Marks, M-A-R-K-S, which is not a name that rings any bells for any of us.

06:28.900 --> 06:35.500
And then the one that Thomas was writing on the desk in the last episode was Bruce Robin,

06:35.500 --> 06:38.460
the name of the man that had just committed suicide in front of us.

06:38.460 --> 06:45.420
But we also remember that way back in the graveyard, the creepy kind of maybe reminded

06:45.420 --> 06:49.980
us of Marvin creatures standing on a mausoleum yelling at us.

06:49.980 --> 06:52.060
And he started spouting numbers.

06:52.060 --> 07:01.260
And in particular, I think he was referencing me, Clark Bishop, and he did a string of numbers

07:01.260 --> 07:03.860
that turned out to spell overseer.

07:03.860 --> 07:04.860
And we asked...

07:04.860 --> 07:05.860
Yeah, that's nothing.

07:05.860 --> 07:06.860
That doesn't...

07:06.860 --> 07:07.860
You probably...

07:08.260 --> 07:10.020
I don't remember anything of it.

07:10.020 --> 07:13.660
And we also asked him who he was.

07:13.660 --> 07:22.300
And he replied with numbers, we think spells out D-C-F-B-I, which is really fucking cool.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.300
What the hell?

07:23.300 --> 07:24.300
Yeah, I don't know.

07:24.300 --> 07:25.740
I don't know what it means.

07:25.740 --> 07:26.740
So yeah.

07:26.740 --> 07:27.740
So we did that off, Mike.

07:27.740 --> 07:31.020
We'll see how that comes out in character.

07:31.020 --> 07:34.900
I remember those numbers clearly.

07:34.900 --> 07:37.620
Once we left off, we just woke up in a room with numbers.

07:37.620 --> 07:40.580
I think it was the Bruce Robin numbers, or did we know?

07:40.580 --> 07:42.660
And we had written them with Bruce's blood.

07:42.660 --> 07:43.660
All over each other.

07:43.660 --> 07:44.660
And we're naked.

07:44.660 --> 07:49.540
Unclothed in the office of Bruce Robin, and you are surrounded...

07:49.540 --> 07:51.540
Oh, fuck.

07:51.540 --> 07:54.540
Oh, my God.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.260
That was sick.

07:56.260 --> 08:00.580
Zach just hit a button on a remote, and the lights in this room turned red.

08:00.580 --> 08:06.700
Yeah, he got some LED lights, y'all, and he deployed it at a really cool time.

08:06.700 --> 08:09.620
That was awesome.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.320
You guys are surrounded by blood.

08:11.320 --> 08:17.220
It smells of deep iron and soulless humanity in this room.

08:17.220 --> 08:22.220
And the reason that you came to is because the two double doors leading into this office

08:22.220 --> 08:27.620
busted open, and three police officers come in as you come to.

08:27.620 --> 08:33.300
The officer in the back is a good-looking older man with gray hair, and I need Clark

08:33.300 --> 08:38.360
to roll intelligence.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.940
I pass an eight on a 55.

08:40.940 --> 08:45.340
I need Thomas and Luke to take off their headphones and plug the ears.

08:45.340 --> 08:52.840
Joe, you recognize this man dressed as a city police officer as Leon Simpson of the circle

08:52.840 --> 08:53.840
of knowledge.

08:53.840 --> 08:54.840
Cool.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.100
Okay, you guys can come back now.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.100
What do you say?

08:57.580 --> 09:03.060
The man in the back drops a couple duffel bags on the ground and promptly puts three

09:03.060 --> 09:06.960
bullets in each of the other two from the back.

09:06.960 --> 09:11.220
They drop to the ground, and he walks into the hall behind him.

09:11.220 --> 09:13.220
What the fuck?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.220
Leon?

09:14.220 --> 09:16.220
I call after him.

09:16.220 --> 09:20.660
You then hear a single gunshot from the hallway.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.100
Oh, shit.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.100
You know that guy?

09:23.100 --> 09:26.620
He's, guys, he's with the circle, he's on our side.

09:26.620 --> 09:27.740
He's with Maggie, at least.

09:27.740 --> 09:30.380
He just killed two cops, though.

09:30.380 --> 09:32.380
We're three cops.

09:32.380 --> 09:33.540
How's that gonna make him feel?

09:33.540 --> 09:36.100
I walk over to my clothes and put them back on.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.100
Covered in blood.

09:37.100 --> 09:41.340
Are you gonna wipe yourself off before you get your old clothes back on?

09:41.340 --> 09:45.600
I'd like to put on the clothes of one of the corpses that Leon just made, whichever one

09:45.600 --> 09:47.760
is the least bloody.

09:47.760 --> 09:53.120
You can change into that, but there will be three bullet holes in the back of the officer's

09:53.120 --> 09:57.120
uniform with blood stained on the back of your back.

09:57.120 --> 10:01.680
Also, the blood that's on you is gonna seep into that material and stuff.

10:01.680 --> 10:07.880
But the gray-haired officer, Leon Simpson, walks back into the office, and he walks up

10:07.880 --> 10:11.320
to one of the duffel bags that he dropped on the ground and reaches in.

10:11.320 --> 10:19.760
He throws on a nice pair of over-the-ear headphones, pulls a pair of forensics gloves on, wipes

10:19.760 --> 10:26.680
his gun, walks over to Bruce Robin, places the gun in Bruce Robin's empty hand, and begins

10:26.680 --> 10:30.440
defacing any writing in the room with numbers on it.

10:30.440 --> 10:35.380
Essentially, he's just trying to clean it up and make the room look less esoteric and

10:35.380 --> 10:38.140
more murder-suicidy.

10:38.140 --> 10:42.080
Is he playing something in his headphones that we can catch from outside the headphones?

10:42.080 --> 10:45.520
Can we hear the bleed-through of sound from his headphones?

10:45.520 --> 10:50.840
For the sake of flavor, you can hear some outlaw country being played.

10:50.840 --> 10:55.860
I sheepishly take off the dead man's clothes as I see him professionally cleaning up the

10:55.860 --> 11:03.720
evidence and I lay it in a pile at his feet and shuffle off covering my penis.

11:03.720 --> 11:04.960
He hasn't acknowledged us, right?

11:04.960 --> 11:08.880
I wanna do a waving hands in the air in front of him.

11:08.880 --> 11:09.880
Leon!

11:09.880 --> 11:10.880
Leon!

11:10.880 --> 11:13.400
He takes his headphones off and he's like, don't fucking touch me.

11:13.400 --> 11:14.400
What are you doing here?

11:14.400 --> 11:15.400
I gotta clean up.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.400
I gotta get out of here.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.040
Should we wait for you to clean up then?

11:18.040 --> 11:20.560
Yeah, I mean, you know, don't spread it around anymore.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.680
And he puts his headphones back in and he keeps working.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.520
How did you know we were here?

11:25.520 --> 11:26.600
He's got his headphones on.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.600
He's not paying attention.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.200
How did he know we were here?

11:29.200 --> 11:31.120
I guess Maggie could have sent him.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.440
That has to be it.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.220
He's with a circle.

11:34.220 --> 11:35.220
He helped me before.

11:35.220 --> 11:38.800
You guys remember when I got those tranquilizer darts that helped us mind control?

11:38.800 --> 11:39.800
Yeah.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.800
I nod over to him.

11:40.800 --> 11:41.800
Got them from him.

11:41.800 --> 11:42.800
Oh.

11:42.800 --> 11:46.080
I'm gonna go and see if there's something, if I can open his duffel bag and see if there's

11:46.080 --> 11:48.240
anything else in there that might help in cleaning.

11:48.240 --> 11:53.440
Yeah, he stops and looks over at you just to like gauge what you're doing.

11:53.440 --> 11:57.280
But when you open it up, you see there's some stuff that you could use to help clean up.

11:57.280 --> 12:04.680
And then also in a second duffel bag, he has three city police officer uniforms that are

12:04.680 --> 12:06.280
clean and pressed.

12:06.280 --> 12:09.560
I wanna use cleaning supplies in the duffel bag to start cleaning myself.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.040
Yeah, I wanna do that too.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.040
Yeah, I'll divvy it out.

12:12.280 --> 12:17.280
I let Clark spray me down with some Windex.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.640
And turn.

12:18.640 --> 12:19.640
And turn.

12:19.640 --> 12:26.680
And you guys see when Clark Bishop takes off his uniform and is cleaning himself off, there

12:26.680 --> 12:31.600
it is, that gaping hole in the middle of Clark Bishop's chest.

12:31.600 --> 12:36.240
But no matter how many times you look at, you can't get away from the fact that it's

12:36.240 --> 12:39.120
horrible.

12:39.120 --> 12:44.000
That's just this like skin tunnel that goes from front to back.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Stop staring guys.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Does it hurt?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Doesn't hurt at all.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Kinda hurts to look at.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Yeah, it's pretty gross.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.800
Do you ever put stuff in it?

12:50.800 --> 12:53.840
That's where I keep my extra gun.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.840
Cool.

12:54.840 --> 12:59.120
Of course it bothers me when I look at it, but I don't know what to tell you.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.880
Just put a shirt on.

13:00.880 --> 13:05.440
Could I put my hand through there and lift you up like some kind of Clark handle?

13:05.440 --> 13:08.440
Ooh, I don't, that sounds like that might hurt.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.440
I try it.

13:11.440 --> 13:15.040
I don't lift, but I get my fingers.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.040
Like are you pulling up?

13:16.040 --> 13:19.100
No, I'm just gonna poke at your hole.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.200
It doesn't hurt when you just kinda touch it.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.560
You've done this before, John.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.360
I know you love touching my hole.

13:26.360 --> 13:30.420
I'm just trying to Pillsbury Doughboy ya.

13:30.420 --> 13:35.360
Looking over at Leon Simpson, he's rifling through paperwork and he eventually finds

13:35.360 --> 13:40.520
something that he's clearly looking for and then he brings out a stamp and you notice

13:40.520 --> 13:47.000
that it is a stamp of Bruce Robin's signature that he is putting on this paperwork and he's

13:47.000 --> 13:51.240
flipping through pages and stamping the bottom right of like every third page.

13:51.240 --> 13:54.640
I'm not gonna interrupt him, but I want to get around his shoulder and see if I can clean

13:54.640 --> 13:56.480
anything from those documents he's stamping.

13:56.480 --> 14:02.280
I think it'd be pretty easy to tell that he is signing over Bruce Robin's share of bar

14:02.280 --> 14:07.280
corp to the mill on the other side of the city.

14:07.280 --> 14:12.840
I'd like to search for like a personal checkbook or anything like that in Bruce Robin's effects.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.840
Yeah, go ahead and roll.

14:14.840 --> 14:15.840
Five.

14:15.840 --> 14:19.440
You don't find a personal checkbook, but you do find a handwritten note.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.440
What's it say?

14:20.440 --> 14:21.440
There's some more numbers.

14:21.440 --> 14:26.360
She broke me open and all new things have the power to escort change in the future of

14:26.360 --> 14:28.200
good in order to break.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.880
Hold on, I'm not reading this right.

14:29.880 --> 14:33.680
Let me read it first to myself to get the syntax.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.000
I hate paying the syntax.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.920
That's why Jesus died for me.

14:39.920 --> 14:45.360
While he's reading that eye rifle through the duffel bag, seeing if there's a belt because

14:45.360 --> 14:49.720
whoever these clothes are for is much larger than me.

14:49.720 --> 14:57.200
You can find a belt off one of the dead officers that doesn't have blood all over it so you

14:57.200 --> 14:58.680
can get a second belt going.

14:58.680 --> 14:59.680
Sweet.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.120
That's why Keith Vigna's comfortable.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.040
My pants aren't falling down anytime soon.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.800
Thomas, you ready to pay the syntax?

15:05.800 --> 15:10.600
Yeah, this person writes funny, but it's a long sentence.

15:10.600 --> 15:14.800
She broke me open and all new things have the power to escort change in the future of

15:14.800 --> 15:19.200
good in order to break the cycle and find fulfillment in an unquestioning goodness that

15:19.200 --> 15:24.240
breaks the relentless tether holding this lie of a world withstanding itself.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.440
I can smell my past.

15:25.440 --> 15:26.560
I can hear the future.

15:26.560 --> 15:27.560
I am joy.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.560
I am destruction.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.560
I am pure.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.600
Harriet.

15:30.600 --> 15:36.600
8-11-8-1-8-9-5-2-0-13-11-8-1-1-1-1-9.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.160
Probably not a zero in there, but that's a 20.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.160
We got that number before.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.800
I don't know if we've done anything with it yet.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.200
There's also another number down there.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.960
Out of character, that is Harriet Marks.

15:44.960 --> 15:48.080
That's the same number we saw in the, I guess I could say that in character.

15:48.080 --> 15:52.600
That's the same number that was written all over the walls in Bruce Robin's house.

15:52.600 --> 15:56.800
It starts this letter and then at the end of it, it's written five times, followed by...

15:56.800 --> 15:58.840
I got an idea.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.200
How can we decode this?

16:01.200 --> 16:03.360
What if you substituted letters for numbers?

16:03.360 --> 16:05.200
Ooh, let's do it.

16:05.200 --> 16:09.200
Is that the Batman music?

16:09.200 --> 16:10.200
Adam West?

16:10.200 --> 16:11.960
I think it says Harriet Marks.

16:11.960 --> 16:17.960
Yeah, and it's not written five times, it's written six times, just the last one's bigger.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.200
And is that the same number up at the top there too?

16:20.200 --> 16:21.240
It sure is.

16:21.240 --> 16:26.320
What a great role-playing experience for providing for all the people.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.960
I'm gonna pull out my phone.

16:27.960 --> 16:32.280
Yeah, I'm gonna need Thomas and Luke to take off their headphones and plug their ears again

16:32.280 --> 16:33.280
real quick.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.920
While he Googles Harriet Marks.

16:35.920 --> 16:41.940
Joe, when Clark Bishop pulls out his phone, if you pull out the burner phone, you see

16:41.940 --> 16:45.840
a text that you've received from the same number as before.

16:45.840 --> 16:53.880
And it says, the book your parents died for is still hidden in an undisclosed location.

16:53.920 --> 16:57.600
I want to text back what book where.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.720
All right, you guys are good.

17:00.720 --> 17:01.720
Come on back.

17:01.720 --> 17:05.040
I'm gonna pull out my phone and Google Harriet Marks.

17:05.040 --> 17:15.880
There's a recent news story about a freshman at CSU, City State University.

17:15.880 --> 17:21.200
Unfortunately she recently committed suicide in her dorm room.

17:21.200 --> 17:27.200
She is known as an organizer and an activist working for pro-union groups.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.720
Does it say if she had a major?

17:28.720 --> 17:30.680
She would have been a political science major.

17:30.680 --> 17:36.240
I'd like to go on some of the more elaborate conspiracy theory boards that John Lee Pettymore

17:36.240 --> 17:37.240
follows.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.240
Absolutely.

17:38.240 --> 17:41.600
And see if any of them are talking about Harriet Marks.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.360
Roll a cult for me.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.360
Woo!

17:44.360 --> 17:47.680
Oh, not unnatural, just a cult.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.080
Oh, I was thinking unnatural also.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.080
Gotcha.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.080
Okay, well I failed.

17:51.960 --> 17:58.960
So when you hop on the boards you find one person who's talking about Harriet Marks and

17:58.960 --> 18:05.360
just saying, like, there were discrepancies within the police report about her suicide.

18:05.360 --> 18:06.360
Just asking questions!

18:06.360 --> 18:11.080
Oh yeah, did it say the cause of, like, do they do that in suicide?

18:11.080 --> 18:13.880
Yeah, they wouldn't tell you in a news article how the suicide occurred.

18:13.880 --> 18:17.360
Oh, also the death happened on December 2nd.

18:17.360 --> 18:20.120
Did you know that Harriet Marks showed every sign?

18:20.160 --> 18:23.160
God damn it.

18:23.160 --> 18:26.200
Did you know that...

18:26.200 --> 18:35.880
Did you know that Harriet Marks showed every sign of a controlled demolition?

18:35.880 --> 18:37.880
We got there, folks.

18:37.880 --> 18:40.360
It's the friends you make along the way.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.840
Jokes are about the journey.

18:41.840 --> 18:45.520
Oh, I do a wave hand at Leon.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.520
Leon!

18:46.520 --> 18:47.520
Yeah, a wave hand.

18:48.080 --> 18:50.080
You ever heard of Harriet Marks?

18:50.080 --> 18:51.080
Yeah.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.080
Who is she to you and us?

18:52.080 --> 18:54.760
Well, that's who we're going to see here pretty soon.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.520
Will you finish up real quick?

18:56.520 --> 19:01.440
We really gotta get going, but yeah, she's clearly earlier on in the thread, and then

19:01.440 --> 19:03.440
he puts his headphones back on.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.440
I turn to the guys.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.960
I mean, I trust Leon.

19:06.960 --> 19:07.960
He helped me earlier.

19:07.960 --> 19:13.320
Okay, well I guess let's help him clean up and see where he's taking us.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.320
I do that too.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.320
Cleaning montage.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.320
Cleaning montage finish?

19:16.320 --> 19:17.320
Oh, yeah, do it.

19:18.320 --> 19:21.320
Oh, wow.

19:21.320 --> 19:27.160
Red juices are just like falling to the floor, like mixed with like suds from those like

19:27.160 --> 19:32.960
handy wipes that come in small little packages that people keep in their purses and bags

19:32.960 --> 19:35.320
and such.

19:35.320 --> 19:41.280
And you guys finally wipe off the very last bit of blood from your hands, and the little

19:41.280 --> 19:46.520
wet nap is just like completely covered in blood, and you throw the very last one into

19:46.520 --> 19:47.520
the trash duffel bag.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.840
Do we have a bloody suds fight somewhere in that montage?

19:51.840 --> 19:52.840
Oh, absolutely.

19:52.840 --> 19:56.880
It just like cuts to it, but the lights keep like flashing all crazy like during those

19:56.880 --> 19:57.880
moments.

19:57.880 --> 20:02.000
Also, at one point, Keith takes a plastic glove and puts it over his head and blows

20:02.000 --> 20:05.920
it up with his nose, and he's like waving his head around.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.320
Howie Mandel style.

20:08.320 --> 20:16.180
So the montage finishes with the three of you standing wearing city police officer uniforms

20:16.180 --> 20:23.540
freshly pressed and very clean, and Leon Simpson picks up the bags and throws in some

20:23.540 --> 20:30.020
paperwork into one of the duffels that's not full of the disgusting blood nappies.

20:30.020 --> 20:34.140
Along with your uniforms, you each have a service pistol.

20:34.140 --> 20:35.500
Oh, shit.

20:35.500 --> 20:41.060
And you hear sirens, and he runs over to the window looking down on the city, and from

20:41.060 --> 20:46.540
17 floors up, you see six police cars roll up to the front.

20:46.540 --> 20:48.460
All right, we got to get out of here quick.

20:48.460 --> 20:49.460
Lead the way.

20:49.460 --> 20:50.460
After you.

20:50.460 --> 20:51.460
Leon leads you into the hallway.

20:51.460 --> 20:54.260
I assume we're all wearing our uniforms, the new uniforms.

20:54.260 --> 20:55.260
I would hope so, yeah.

20:55.260 --> 20:56.260
I'll put them on.

20:56.260 --> 20:59.340
And then real fast as we enter the hall, oh, did you just say enter the hallway?

20:59.340 --> 21:01.100
Enter the hallway.

21:01.100 --> 21:03.900
As you guys enter the hallway, there's a distinct smell.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.020
What does it smell like?

21:05.020 --> 21:07.820
It smells like dead Winifred.

21:07.820 --> 21:10.700
Oh, no.

21:10.700 --> 21:18.940
She has exhumed her bowels, and Leon does not pay any mind as he walks right over her

21:18.940 --> 21:24.740
to the stairwell on the far side of the elevator and begins walking down the stairs.

21:24.740 --> 21:26.740
Winifred is dead.

21:26.740 --> 21:30.700
I don't know that song, John.

21:30.700 --> 21:33.900
Yeah, I was just inspired.

21:33.900 --> 21:39.420
Well, when he's dead.

21:39.420 --> 21:41.260
That's the kind of music that John Lee Pettymore likes.

21:41.260 --> 21:44.380
The stairs go down to floor 14.

21:44.380 --> 21:46.900
No, sorry.

21:46.900 --> 21:52.220
The stairs go down to the 12th floor, and when you get to the 12th floor, you have to

21:52.220 --> 21:58.440
exit and go into the hallway, and it seems to be like an accounting floor.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.700
There's no one at this point.

22:00.700 --> 22:02.020
All the lights are off.

22:02.020 --> 22:06.720
You see a cleaning person on the far side away from you, and you guys just walk over

22:06.720 --> 22:10.920
to the next set of stairs on the other side and begin to head down.

22:10.920 --> 22:14.400
I need whoever has the lowest luck to roll luck for me.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.400
I have 35.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.400
That's me.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.400
20.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.400
70.

22:18.400 --> 22:25.320
As you guys head down the stairs, you hear the doors open at the bottom of the stairwell,

22:25.320 --> 22:35.480
and you hear the chatter of police.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.480
What is this?

22:37.240 --> 22:39.800
So you guys, what do you want to do?

22:39.800 --> 22:42.960
Leon looks at you, and he's like, we're going to have to dip off at some point.

22:42.960 --> 22:48.120
Is that where the balls came from originally, the Piston Pig Farm?

22:48.120 --> 22:55.440
I'm making the same joke as you, but like, no, okay, I'm sorry.

22:55.440 --> 22:59.640
You can't just ask me big questions about the campaign as a joke, Thomas.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.080
I'm not going to answer them.

23:01.080 --> 23:04.040
So yeah, we were literally, we came from a pig farm.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.560
You meant the cops come from a pig farm?

23:05.560 --> 23:07.160
The cops come from a pig farm.

23:07.160 --> 23:12.200
That could have been the joke of the whole campaign.

23:12.200 --> 23:16.360
I want to use disguise to just act like a cop.

23:16.360 --> 23:19.160
Yeah, I'd like to use being a cop to act like a cop.

23:19.160 --> 23:23.560
All right, go ahead and roll disguise and...

23:23.560 --> 23:24.560
Hell yeah.

23:24.560 --> 23:25.560
15 on a 30.

23:25.560 --> 23:26.560
Can I just roll law to do that?

23:26.560 --> 23:27.560
Yeah, absolutely.

23:27.560 --> 23:30.560
Yeah, I'd like to roll law.

23:30.560 --> 23:31.560
Damn it.

23:31.560 --> 23:32.560
54 on a 50.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.560
85 on a 60.

23:33.560 --> 23:34.560
Oh, fantastic.

23:34.560 --> 23:40.320
So you guys are like halfway down, and he turns and he's like, you guys are walking

23:40.320 --> 23:41.320
weird.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.320
We're going to have to take an elevator.

23:43.320 --> 23:48.120
And he dips out of the stairwell into a new hallway where it's another floor that's empty.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.880
You know, the lights are off.

23:49.880 --> 23:50.880
Nobody's there.

23:50.880 --> 23:51.880
It's Saturday.

23:51.880 --> 23:56.720
And also Bruce Robin gave pretty much everyone the day off and the weeks off.

23:56.720 --> 23:59.000
So there's no one in the building essentially.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.140
So you hit the elevator and as you get to the very bottom, you see, as soon as the elevator

24:04.220 --> 24:11.820
door opens, the security guard and the secretary who are sitting in the foyer of this large

24:11.820 --> 24:17.660
building and the security guard makes direct eye contact with you guys and then grabs his

24:17.660 --> 24:21.100
radio and then takes off running in the opposite direction.

24:21.100 --> 24:26.300
Clark, you're first act if you would like to do this in combat order.

24:26.300 --> 24:28.660
Well, can I just observe what Leon's doing?

24:28.660 --> 24:30.340
I'd like to follow his lead as much as possible.

24:30.340 --> 24:32.500
Yeah, you can wait for him to go.

24:32.500 --> 24:35.660
When do we sense he might go on the turn order?

24:35.660 --> 24:36.820
You can see him.

24:36.820 --> 24:38.500
He's already like reaching for his gun.

24:38.500 --> 24:39.500
Oh, he is reaching for his gun?

24:39.500 --> 24:40.980
Oh, he's reaching for his gun.

24:40.980 --> 24:41.980
Okay.

24:41.980 --> 24:42.980
Then I'm reaching for mine.

24:42.980 --> 24:46.460
I'm just going to, I'm going to hold the guy who's running at gun point.

24:46.460 --> 24:47.460
I'm not going to shoot.

24:47.460 --> 24:48.460
Hey, stop.

24:48.460 --> 24:49.460
Stop right there.

24:49.460 --> 24:52.460
Roll off.

24:52.460 --> 24:54.220
Pass a five on a 60.

24:54.220 --> 24:55.220
Hell yeah.

24:55.220 --> 24:57.100
The security guard freezes.

24:57.100 --> 25:02.280
His radio is in one of his hands, hands that are slowly raising into the air.

25:02.280 --> 25:05.080
You know, like you do when a cop yells at you.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.000
It's now Leon's turn.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.640
Oh shit.

25:08.640 --> 25:09.640
Okay.

25:09.640 --> 25:17.760
So he aims his pistol and as soon as the bullet fires, you hear a coming from the radio as

25:17.760 --> 25:20.640
if it was an aerosol can that got shot with a BB gun.

25:20.640 --> 25:22.160
Luke, what are you doing?

25:22.160 --> 25:23.320
I hear him fire.

25:23.320 --> 25:25.040
I don't see it exactly hit.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.480
So I'd fire on the guy as well.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.480
Go ahead and roll firearms.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.960
61 on a 70.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.560
Roll a d10 for damage.

25:34.560 --> 25:37.000
It's one of the ones you are stupid.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.800
How long have we been playing this game?

25:40.800 --> 25:41.800
One.

25:41.800 --> 25:42.800
All right, nice.

25:42.800 --> 25:50.880
So, uh, you shoot him and you actually see one of his fingers just like fly off.

25:50.880 --> 25:55.600
Like it was like a carnival game and you like hit the thing to knock it down, but it was

25:55.600 --> 25:58.120
a finger and now it's not on his hand anymore.

25:58.120 --> 25:59.120
Exactly.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.120
He's like, dang.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.040
Yeah, he yells, dang, Thomas.

26:03.040 --> 26:05.000
What is John Lee Pettymore doing?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.840
He's going to try to shoot this guy.

26:06.840 --> 26:10.040
Oh fuck, 74 on a 60.

26:10.040 --> 26:18.360
He is like running away and he turns a corner and Leon just turns back and he's like, gone

26:18.360 --> 26:20.240
is just as good as dead.

26:20.240 --> 26:24.120
And he dips like full blown runs to the entrance.

26:24.120 --> 26:30.360
You actually see that there is only two police officers within sight outside on the other

26:30.360 --> 26:35.800
side of the, what's that called the, the, the ring around the rosy fellow that gets

26:35.800 --> 26:46.160
you into large like hotels and stuff revolving door and they are going to absolutely notice

26:46.160 --> 26:47.160
you guys.

26:47.160 --> 26:51.480
So Leon stops short about 10 feet in front of the revolving door.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.280
I want to, I want to wave at them.

26:53.280 --> 26:54.280
We need backup.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.280
Did you hear those gunshots?

26:55.280 --> 26:56.280
Get in here quick.

26:56.280 --> 26:57.280
Awesome.

26:57.280 --> 27:05.720
Go ahead and roll law or persuade 98 fails of fail.

27:05.720 --> 27:06.720
Yep.

27:06.720 --> 27:11.680
They immediately start talking to each other and then they're going to take cover behind

27:11.680 --> 27:15.520
the police car that is right outside where you parked around side.

27:15.520 --> 27:16.520
Can I find a side exit?

27:16.520 --> 27:18.480
Let's see what happens here.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.440
Yeah, he knows.

27:20.440 --> 27:26.340
So he's like, yeah, there's a side exit right around here and you guys dip off to the right

27:26.340 --> 27:33.280
and there's another stairwell on that side with an exit door head through there and into

27:33.280 --> 27:37.040
the mid evening on December 6th in the city.

27:37.040 --> 27:38.040
Yeah.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.040
I'd like to get in that car.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.040
Yeah.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.040
I'm filing in with Leon.

27:41.040 --> 27:42.040
You guys all get in the car.

27:42.040 --> 27:47.080
Leon gets in the driver's seat and as soon as he puts the pedal to the metal, you hear

27:47.080 --> 27:51.800
a whoop whoop and baby, we got a motherfucking car chase.

27:51.800 --> 27:56.320
These two dudes who are outside definitely recognize that you weren't officers got into

27:56.320 --> 28:01.200
their car and are about to chase you Leon through the city on a scale from one to a

28:01.200 --> 28:02.200
hundred.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.200
How good of a driver are you?

28:03.200 --> 28:04.200
What'd you say?

28:04.200 --> 28:05.200
I would say 70.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.200
Okay.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.200
The uh, me too.

28:07.200 --> 28:12.640
So we don't need to switch positions or anything, but maybe I could spot for you like a, like

28:12.640 --> 28:15.320
a, the rally driving teams do.

28:15.320 --> 28:19.320
I could call corners and shit for you and tell you where the bad guys are.

28:19.320 --> 28:20.320
Hell yeah.

28:20.320 --> 28:21.320
That's dope.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.320
Sweet.

28:22.320 --> 28:28.080
So with a city police car right behind you in chase, it is going to start with Clark

28:28.080 --> 28:29.080
Bishop's turn.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.080
What would you like to do?

28:30.080 --> 28:31.080
Hunker down.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.080
I don't want to be in the window.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.080
Okay.

28:33.080 --> 28:34.080
Go ahead and roll stealth.

28:34.080 --> 28:39.040
Uh, fail 43 on a 30.

28:39.040 --> 28:40.040
Okay.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.400
You just can not get your legs.

28:42.400 --> 28:49.120
So like those whole backseat is just filled with like a bunch of tactical gear and all

28:49.120 --> 28:54.540
sorts of weird like devices and machinery.

28:54.540 --> 28:56.620
And there's all these things that are in the floorboards.

28:56.620 --> 29:01.720
So your feet can't occupy that space and it's making your head stick up in the window in

29:01.720 --> 29:02.720
the back.

29:02.720 --> 29:03.720
Keith, what are you doing?

29:03.720 --> 29:05.260
Is there a shotgun back here?

29:05.260 --> 29:06.800
There's a shotgun like in the middle.

29:06.800 --> 29:07.800
Yeah.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.000
I grab it, roll the window down and shoot at the driver.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
All right.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Roll firearms.

29:12.600 --> 29:15.600
Fail 92 on a 70.

29:15.600 --> 29:16.600
Oof.

29:16.600 --> 29:23.280
As the, as the car takes a corner, you just like fire and miss very badly.

29:23.280 --> 29:26.160
But thankfully there are no pedestrians around.

29:26.160 --> 29:32.080
No bleak looking haggard fools running about and for you to accidentally shoot Thomas.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.000
Can I make like a drive roll to assist him?

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
You absolutely can.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Okay.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
43 on a 70.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
All right.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.560
He is going to, he rolled a 67 against a 72.

29:43.560 --> 29:47.480
Look out, school bus up ahead, 200 yards on the rack.

29:47.480 --> 29:52.580
He slides like his back end whips almost touching the school bus.

29:52.580 --> 29:56.880
And as you guys pass, you see just like all these kids with their nasty grubby little

29:56.880 --> 30:02.560
fingers on the windows, just like looking down like, oh wow.

30:02.560 --> 30:03.600
And like give him a wink.

30:03.600 --> 30:08.040
It cuts into slow-mo as John Lee Pettymore winks at them out the window.

30:08.040 --> 30:13.560
And then it immediately goes back into normal speed as the car just dips away right before

30:13.560 --> 30:19.720
the police car behind just slams into the school bus about halfway in between the middle.

30:19.720 --> 30:20.720
Oh no.

30:20.720 --> 30:21.720
Oh, hell, hell yeah.

30:21.720 --> 30:22.720
I manifested that guys.

30:22.720 --> 30:31.040
I just put what I wanted out into the universe and that's the secret.

30:31.040 --> 30:35.000
I'm going to have whoever has the highest luck roll a luck check on this one.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Got a 55.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
That's you.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Go ahead and roll that luck baby.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.720
This is to see if another police car is within the area.

30:41.720 --> 30:42.720
No, that's not good.

30:42.720 --> 30:43.720
That's a hundo.

30:43.720 --> 30:44.720
Oh fuck.

30:44.720 --> 30:45.720
I saw the zero zero and I was like.

30:45.720 --> 30:46.720
At ease.

30:46.720 --> 30:47.720
We're set.

30:47.720 --> 30:51.280
Two police cars immediately are on your tail.

30:51.280 --> 30:55.720
Good thing school's just getting out.

30:55.720 --> 30:56.720
Clark Bishop.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.040
We just learned a great trick.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.220
It is your turn.

31:00.220 --> 31:04.340
Can I look through the stuff that's in the back seat here for anything that I could throw

31:04.340 --> 31:08.900
out the window that would act as, I mean, spike strip especially, but just something

31:08.900 --> 31:11.340
that they would hit that would make their car fucked up.

31:11.340 --> 31:12.340
Yeah.

31:12.340 --> 31:13.340
Roll search for me.

31:13.340 --> 31:14.340
You have a great search.

31:14.340 --> 31:17.020
I got a 20.

31:17.020 --> 31:18.380
I do not pass.

31:18.380 --> 31:21.400
You find two pairs of flip flops.

31:21.400 --> 31:23.060
Toss them out the window.

31:23.060 --> 31:24.060
Take that.

31:24.060 --> 31:28.660
Keith, what are you doing?

31:29.540 --> 31:31.820
Is it really going down?

31:31.820 --> 31:33.460
I want to aim the shotgun.

31:33.460 --> 31:38.980
I want to shoot one of the flip flops out of the air and then shoot at the driver of

31:38.980 --> 31:40.060
the closest car.

31:40.060 --> 31:42.660
Like to intimidate them with your marksmanship?

31:42.660 --> 31:43.660
Back off, buddy.

31:43.660 --> 31:47.780
Yeah, he throws them out and I just go and then aim at the driver.

31:47.780 --> 31:50.340
We're a traveling circus act.

31:50.340 --> 31:53.980
What just demonstrates that we're accurate and we have ammunition to spare.

31:53.980 --> 31:55.220
We are not to be fucked with.

31:55.220 --> 31:58.620
Those are two very intimidating factors.

31:58.620 --> 31:59.740
Don't need to roll twice.

31:59.740 --> 32:01.460
You would need to roll once.

32:01.460 --> 32:03.340
And no shortage of footwear.

32:03.340 --> 32:04.760
Nine.

32:04.760 --> 32:11.000
You do exactly what you called the flip flop actually lands on the windshield with a buckshot

32:11.000 --> 32:13.180
like through the middle of it.

32:13.180 --> 32:19.860
And then another fire just eviscerates the flip flop on the windshield as the windshield

32:19.860 --> 32:22.620
busts out and you see a spray of blood.

32:22.620 --> 32:23.620
Oh.

32:23.620 --> 32:24.620
Oh.

32:24.620 --> 32:25.620
Oh.

32:25.620 --> 32:26.620
Intimidated them to death.

32:27.620 --> 32:28.620
Roll 2D6.

32:28.620 --> 32:29.620
Thank you.

32:31.620 --> 32:32.620
Shit.

32:32.620 --> 32:33.620
Wow.

32:33.620 --> 32:34.620
Fuck.

32:34.620 --> 32:35.620
I'm so sorry.

32:35.620 --> 32:36.620
Yeah.

32:36.620 --> 32:37.620
I let him borrow a 2D6.

32:37.620 --> 32:39.620
I'll take those back and burn them in shame.

32:39.620 --> 32:40.620
Oh yeah.

32:40.620 --> 32:41.620
So I got a one and a one.

32:41.620 --> 32:47.180
The officer turns on the windshield wipers and you see that it wasn't blood that sprayed.

32:47.180 --> 32:52.620
They were holding a red smoothie of some sort in front of them that happened to explode.

32:52.620 --> 32:53.620
And a jelly doughnut.

32:53.620 --> 32:54.620
Yeah.

32:54.620 --> 32:55.620
Oh my god.

32:56.620 --> 33:01.100
And the jelly just flies about through the car and uh.

33:01.100 --> 33:04.140
And now they're real mad.

33:04.140 --> 33:08.020
But he's going to take a negative twenty on the next drive check so Thomas would you like

33:08.020 --> 33:10.900
to attempt the same thing or are you going to do something different?

33:10.900 --> 33:13.300
Uh I'll go ahead and try to support again.

33:13.300 --> 33:14.300
Fuck.

33:14.300 --> 33:16.620
Seventy one on the seventy.

33:16.620 --> 33:17.620
Woah.

33:17.620 --> 33:18.620
So some.

33:18.620 --> 33:25.580
Oh he passed and the cop behind failed so as you are going through an intersection you

33:25.580 --> 33:31.180
have got the red light and he punches it as a semi goes right behind him and it takes

33:31.180 --> 33:39.060
out one of the cop cars just like rams directly into the trailer of the semi pretty much taking

33:39.060 --> 33:43.080
off the entire top of the car.

33:43.080 --> 33:50.000
However you see the second police car fly around the semi and it's still on your tail.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Go ahead and.

33:51.000 --> 33:56.400
Someone better compose some kick ass hillbilly jangle and chase music for this.

33:56.400 --> 33:57.800
Woo hoo.

33:57.800 --> 34:02.440
Limp contention boys are at it again.

34:02.440 --> 34:05.040
Clark Bishop topped the line up what are we doing?

34:05.040 --> 34:10.280
Frustrated that all of his non-lethal attempts have failed I'm going to roll down the window

34:10.280 --> 34:11.720
and try to shoot out a tire.

34:11.720 --> 34:13.320
Alright roll firearms.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.320
Nice.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.320
A pass.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.440
A six on an eighty.

34:17.480 --> 34:22.140
Alright that is going to give a negative forty to the drive check of the driver on this next

34:22.140 --> 34:23.140
attempt.

34:23.140 --> 34:24.140
Keith Vigno what are we doing?

34:24.140 --> 34:27.000
I'm doing the same thing shooting at the driver again.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Alrighty.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Eleven.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
Good pass.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Nice.

34:31.000 --> 34:38.600
Actually you know what on a crit just describe how the car wrecks when you murder the driver.

34:38.600 --> 34:45.280
Well what I do is I aim the shotgun at the passenger kill him and then just chuck the

34:45.280 --> 34:50.800
shotgun at the driver and we're going fast enough that it just impales the driver through

34:50.800 --> 34:54.720
the head.

34:54.720 --> 35:00.440
Then the driver falls on his steering wheel the car takes a sharp right and just starts

35:00.440 --> 35:05.040
rolling and then yeah stops.

35:05.040 --> 35:07.120
It stops.

35:07.120 --> 35:09.120
And then it explodes.

35:09.120 --> 35:12.000
God damn Keith.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Hell yeah.

35:13.200 --> 35:17.200
I blow off the smoke from my finger gun.

35:17.200 --> 35:21.440
Those guys were definitely just corrupt cops in the pocket of Marvin Glass right?

35:21.440 --> 35:22.440
Absolutely.

35:22.440 --> 35:23.440
Yeah.

35:23.440 --> 35:24.440
I think they implied.

35:24.440 --> 35:25.440
I heard them say that.

35:25.440 --> 35:26.440
Let's tell ourselves that.

35:26.440 --> 35:31.160
I think the last time in our past lives we found out that most of the police force was

35:31.160 --> 35:32.680
in Marvin's pocket you're correct.

35:32.680 --> 35:39.240
Okay so we don't have to feel any kind of way about slaying our brothers in arms just

35:39.240 --> 35:42.960
indiscriminately we can just do that all over the streets of the city.

35:42.960 --> 35:45.840
You're right Jon you gotta be right.

35:45.840 --> 35:48.560
And we're gonna have fun doing it.

35:48.560 --> 35:52.480
Let's go ahead and get some sanity checks to see if that rationalization actually plays

35:52.480 --> 35:55.600
out in your minds or whether you're just saying it out loud.

35:55.600 --> 35:56.600
No.

35:56.600 --> 35:58.480
36 on a 14.

35:58.480 --> 35:59.480
I fail.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.080
13 on an 8.

36:01.080 --> 36:06.080
I'm not rolling.

36:06.080 --> 36:12.080
Oh shit has that always been an option?

36:12.080 --> 36:21.800
No I have a thing that Luke doesn't have to roll sanity when he doesn't feel like it.

36:21.800 --> 36:26.960
When it would be the reason for the sanity is an emotional reason because Keith Vigna

36:26.960 --> 36:29.200
has no empathy in his body.

36:29.200 --> 36:33.440
I have no empathy and I don't care when other people die.

36:33.440 --> 36:35.440
I want that.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.960
Go crazy.

36:37.960 --> 36:57.520
And with that I'm gonna have Thomas and Joe leave the room.

36:57.520 --> 37:03.720
Luke Leon drives free and you hear the sirens fade in the distance but as your heartbeat

37:03.720 --> 37:13.320
is calming down you notice Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore begun diving into themselves

37:13.320 --> 37:30.480
mentally and they both begin murmuring and muttering 2 1 8 2 1 3 5 1 8 1 5 2 9 1 4.

37:30.480 --> 37:33.480
You recognize it as the sequence.

37:33.480 --> 37:41.400
You are all writing upstairs in the office of Bruce Robin that you have translated and

37:41.400 --> 37:45.180
this man I believe Clark told you his name is Leon Simpson.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.180
He looks at you.

37:46.180 --> 37:47.180
Oh good.

37:47.180 --> 37:48.180
You're not.

37:48.180 --> 37:49.440
Okay so we got one of you.

37:49.440 --> 37:55.800
What the f- Do you know about this?

37:55.800 --> 37:57.960
I've heard that number before.

37:57.960 --> 37:58.960
We've seen it.

37:58.960 --> 38:02.600
Yeah it was all over the place upstairs when I came in.

38:02.600 --> 38:09.760
Yeah I mean so we deciphered one that we'd seen in Bruce Robin's house that said Harriet

38:09.760 --> 38:15.800
Marks I think let me think and I you know like jot down what I can remember of that

38:15.800 --> 38:21.120
number and start doing the same thing and I'm it says Bruce Robin.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.880
It says Bruce Robin.

38:22.880 --> 38:25.800
They're just repeating Bruce Robin over and over?

38:25.800 --> 38:26.800
Yeah.

38:26.800 --> 38:32.640
Before you showed up we all the all the numbers on the wall we I don't remember doing any

38:32.640 --> 38:38.380
of it but I just kind of snapped out of it and and you know woke up just covered in blood

38:38.380 --> 38:42.440
and we looked like we'd written that all over the walls.

38:42.440 --> 38:44.440
I don't know.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.040
I mean obviously we killed Bruce.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.440
I don't know why they're chanting it though.

38:48.440 --> 38:52.640
Oh no no I guess we we got in a scuffle with him and then he killed himself.

38:52.640 --> 38:53.640
He shot himself?

38:53.640 --> 38:54.640
He shot himself.

38:54.640 --> 38:55.640
Okay.

38:55.640 --> 38:56.640
Yeah with his with his gun.

38:56.680 --> 39:00.960
Because it made it look like a suicide before I came in and made it look like a murder suicide.

39:00.960 --> 39:02.980
No he uh he killed himself.

39:02.980 --> 39:04.760
Do you have any idea why?

39:04.760 --> 39:07.440
He was chanting some weird shit.

39:07.440 --> 39:12.360
I was expecting him to try to kill us and not I didn't expect him to kill himself.

39:12.360 --> 39:13.680
I'm Leon by the way.

39:13.680 --> 39:16.640
I'm oh shit.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.440
Keith, Keith Figna.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.440
How did.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.320
Oh you're you're Fergie's brother?

39:21.320 --> 39:22.320
Yeah.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.320
That must have been a hell of a childhood.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.480
It wasn't fun.

39:25.480 --> 39:26.480
Yeah that guy's a dick.

39:26.520 --> 39:27.520
How did you know him?

39:27.520 --> 39:29.120
What do you mean how did I know him?

39:29.120 --> 39:31.200
I'm in the circle of knowledge.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.960
Was Fergie in the circle of knowledge?

39:33.960 --> 39:36.600
Oh you really don't know anything do you?

39:36.600 --> 39:37.600
No.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.480
There's a lot of stuff I don't know.

39:39.480 --> 39:42.320
Well that might work out in our favor for now.

39:42.320 --> 39:45.880
Can you at least tell me that though was Fergie in the circle of knowledge?

39:45.880 --> 39:46.880
Yeah.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.240
Shit.

39:48.240 --> 39:50.160
Did you know your brother at all?

39:50.160 --> 39:51.800
Not really not since we were kids.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.300
I just thought he.

39:53.300 --> 39:54.840
What is Bar Corp?

39:54.840 --> 39:57.200
Was Bruce Robin in the circle of knowledge?

39:57.200 --> 40:03.560
Bruce had his own ideas of what was good to do in this world but I think he meant well

40:03.560 --> 40:10.180
and you know Ferguson used him because he was so goddamn smart but yeah.

40:10.180 --> 40:16.180
You know it's it's probably better that you learn this from someone else but your your

40:16.180 --> 40:23.480
brother is a I mean he's a dick but he's a good man you know he's he's working he's trying

40:23.480 --> 40:30.240
to keep the or he was trying to keep the world safe in a way in his own way in our

40:30.240 --> 40:37.800
own way but more and more I'm starting to question whether or not our version of the

40:37.800 --> 40:42.000
world is worth saving.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.420
This is you said we're going to see Harriet Marks I thought she killed herself.

40:46.420 --> 40:51.600
She did kill herself we got to find out why and what led up to that.

40:51.600 --> 40:57.200
What's important about her though like she was just a kid and he opens up the glove box

40:57.200 --> 41:04.780
right in front of you I just got a hold of these he hands you a file folder full of pictures

41:04.780 --> 41:12.760
he's like I got these recently from the investigation in on Harriet Marks's apparent suicide I mean

41:12.760 --> 41:21.940
you can see for yourself spray-painted all over her dorm room one five two two five one

41:21.940 --> 41:29.820
eight one nine five five one eight have you just have you figured out what that means

41:29.820 --> 41:38.640
yet well it is only through death that he may live where have I heard that before and

41:38.640 --> 41:47.300
he looks in his rearview mirror at Clark Bishop who is mumbling these numbers to himself

41:47.300 --> 41:53.880
over and over and over.

41:53.880 --> 41:58.820
It's only through death that he may live that's that wasn't a something that Clark found it

41:58.820 --> 42:05.500
was a picture of a drawing of somebody in a hood and and written scrawled in there over

42:05.500 --> 42:09.480
and over and over again was that like what do you know that from?

42:09.480 --> 42:17.320
Your partner Clark Bishop is not a man it's more than a man I don't know if he's always

42:17.320 --> 42:24.400
been more than a man or if it's just his future or destiny or I don't even know if I believe

42:24.400 --> 42:30.940
in that anymore but your your partner Clark Bishop looking at him still through the rearview

42:30.940 --> 42:44.080
mirror he is a god he is a savior Clark and I look at him and how do you know this it's

42:44.080 --> 42:51.040
been a prophecy within the circle of knowledge for as long as the circle of knowledge has

42:51.040 --> 42:59.520
existed I don't know how to tell you this but Clark Bishop is the overseer and he will

42:59.520 --> 43:11.160
eventually in the past start the circle of knowledge like he time travels or and at that

43:11.160 --> 43:15.060
moment John Lee Pettymore and Clark Bishop snap out of it.

43:29.520 --> 43:45.960
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the

43:45.960 --> 44:04.440
circle of knowledge How can you have enough drowning out of the circle of knowledge
