00:00.000 --> 00:06.680
Welcome one and all, it is your only good boy radio DJ Wolf the Dog, and I'm hoping

00:06.680 --> 00:11.640
y'all give me some of them good pets for giving you that good news.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.880
Well it's usually bad news but y'all get it.

00:14.880 --> 00:21.860
Remember to keep those radios tuned to 694.2 PTBP if you want to give Wolf the Dog the

00:21.860 --> 00:27.400
emotional support he needs to keep on going and trudging through the eternal hellscape

00:27.400 --> 00:29.960
that is news and contention.

00:29.960 --> 00:36.000
My producer informs me today that we are celebrating being on air for six months.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.560
That's crazy as hell y'all, I thought it'd only been a few days here in contention time.

00:41.560 --> 00:46.560
But as we all know, time is an illusion my babies.

00:46.560 --> 00:51.640
But what isn't an illusion is my favorite segment, Howlin' with Wolf.

00:51.640 --> 00:56.680
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from a listener named James W. who emailed us at

00:56.680 --> 00:59.840
pretendingpaw.gmail.com.

00:59.840 --> 01:04.480
Seems they were able to find some audio that is addressed to the police department here

01:04.480 --> 01:05.480
in contention.

01:05.480 --> 01:11.240
Well howdy boys, my name's Jim Hammer.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.760
I'm the mayor of Texas.

01:13.760 --> 01:19.840
I just wanted to say I've been listening to your radio program and I wanted to extend

01:19.840 --> 01:24.920
my help to some boys out there who are doing some good in the world.

01:25.640 --> 01:29.800
If you ever need anything, I could give you a place to hide.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.320
Got an underground bunker system out here.

01:32.320 --> 01:38.760
Ted Cruz is currently hiding in there from some vigilante justice groups, mostly coming

01:38.760 --> 01:44.360
after him for that beard he's growing, but you know, also being the zodiac killer and

01:44.360 --> 01:45.360
whatnot.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.520
But anyways, come on down if you need help.

01:47.520 --> 01:52.160
I could maybe even pardon you for your crimes and such if you need it.

01:52.760 --> 01:56.000
Just remember you got a friend out here in Texas.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Bye!

01:57.000 --> 02:02.320
Thanks Jim Hammer, mayor of Texas, for reaching out.

02:02.320 --> 02:10.720
Hey Jim, no reason, but if your good sweet boy Wolf the dog got himself in some hot water

02:10.720 --> 02:17.480
here in contention, is there any room in that bunker for a little dog like Wolf?

02:17.480 --> 02:24.160
This week we have a special presentation here on 694.2 PTBP, Condensions newest and

02:24.160 --> 02:27.140
only radio station.

02:27.140 --> 02:34.480
We are going to broadcast a recap episode with listener Q&A from a podcast called Pretending

02:34.480 --> 02:36.480
to be People.

02:36.480 --> 02:42.240
They have asked me to point out that their show is serialized and there will be spoilers

02:42.240 --> 02:44.120
in this discussion.

02:44.160 --> 02:49.960
So head on back to episode one, when I was but a wee baby my babies.

02:49.960 --> 02:56.520
But first and always, it's kudzu with no backbone.

02:56.520 --> 03:16.680
It's kudzu with no backbone.

03:16.680 --> 03:25.720
It's kudzu with no backbone.

03:25.720 --> 03:31.640
It should be working I think, I'm going to turn this here now.

03:31.640 --> 03:39.320
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me,

03:39.320 --> 03:44.040
in no backbone.

03:44.040 --> 03:47.800
In no backbone.

03:47.800 --> 03:51.400
Hello everyone and welcome to Pretending to be People.

03:51.400 --> 03:57.360
I am sitting in this room with Thomas, Luke, Joe, and Justin.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.200
For the first time all five of us are in the same room.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.560
And today we are releasing a special presentation.

04:03.560 --> 04:09.600
Thank you so much Wolf for having us on your program.

04:09.600 --> 04:17.400
We are here to release a Q&A episode from questions that we've received from listeners.

04:17.400 --> 04:22.960
And the reason that we are doing this, one, obviously to connect with the community.

04:22.960 --> 04:28.920
You guys are growing out there and we really like interacting with all of you.

04:28.920 --> 04:33.040
Very excited about what's in store for the show.

04:33.040 --> 04:40.440
And we are here to release this Q&A episode as a sort of thank you.

04:40.440 --> 04:43.960
Thank you and a kind of launch for our Patreon.

04:43.960 --> 04:44.960
A taste.

04:44.960 --> 04:49.160
Yeah, a taste of what you're going to get on the Patreon, extra content.

04:49.160 --> 04:52.840
But we were kind of blown away by the response we've gotten so far to this podcast.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.280
It's burned my mind, honestly.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.040
So we want to give you guys more.

04:56.040 --> 05:00.360
It's made me just so rock fucking hard.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.420
I can't explain to you guys.

05:02.420 --> 05:06.280
It's really difficult to be around Zach now because of his raging erections.

05:06.280 --> 05:07.880
It's visible at all times.

05:07.880 --> 05:11.080
I like it that way and it's all thanks to all of you.

05:11.080 --> 05:16.280
His wife has tearfully confessed to me that she can't be seen in public with Zach anymore.

05:16.280 --> 05:21.400
His head has visibly grown too.

05:21.400 --> 05:25.480
There's too much blood in the dick and some of it rushes back up to the head.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.920
I've had to get new hats.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.800
It's been an issue.

05:28.800 --> 05:33.320
But with your Patreon subscriptions, you can buy new hats.

05:33.320 --> 05:34.320
Hopefully.

05:34.320 --> 05:35.320
That is the goal.

05:35.320 --> 05:38.480
We are trying to raise money for new hats for my giant fucking head.

05:38.480 --> 05:43.480
Luke, you are the only one who's complained to me in public about people coming up to

05:43.480 --> 05:45.640
you about the podcast.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.640
It's not a complaint.

05:46.640 --> 05:47.640
It just happens.

05:47.640 --> 05:52.400
No, literally somebody talked to us and you were like, it's so annoying when that happens.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.880
I don't think I said so annoying.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.360
It has happened quite a bit.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.840
But I do go out more than the rest of you.

05:58.840 --> 06:02.600
Luke will take pictures with you for sure if you see him out.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.600
For five dollars.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.600
No.

06:04.600 --> 06:09.800
Not only for me, but the rest of the crew if you want them in, we'll put that on the

06:09.800 --> 06:10.800
Patreon.

06:10.800 --> 06:11.800
We'll figure it out.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.420
Yes, we are launching a Patreon.

06:14.420 --> 06:19.480
This is honestly, to be completely frank, it is to keep the show going.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.480
That's true.

06:20.480 --> 06:26.120
I and we spend so much time working on this show to give you guys the quality content

06:26.120 --> 06:29.200
that we think that you deserve.

06:29.200 --> 06:34.280
Real quick, Zach completely makes this podcast what it is.

06:34.280 --> 06:38.880
His editing, his attention to detail, all the work he puts into this makes it the podcast

06:38.880 --> 06:40.580
you love.

06:40.580 --> 06:45.760
So not to get too NPR on you guys, but we need to make it a job for him.

06:45.760 --> 06:46.760
It needs to...

06:46.760 --> 06:50.160
He puts many, many hours into it.

06:50.160 --> 06:56.880
We take a little bit of time out of our days to edit a little bit, but it's mostly Zach

06:56.880 --> 06:59.200
doing this for you and for us.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.440
It's a joy.

07:00.440 --> 07:04.480
And on top of doing all the technical editing stuff, he's running the game and writing the

07:04.480 --> 07:05.480
game.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.740
So he's pulling triple if not quadruple duty.

07:08.740 --> 07:09.740
It's so much fun.

07:09.740 --> 07:10.740
I really enjoy it.

07:10.740 --> 07:13.740
I want to keep doing it.

07:13.740 --> 07:16.720
I want to make this campaign something special.

07:16.720 --> 07:20.820
We've run some really fun campaigns in the past with this group, and I really think that

07:20.820 --> 07:25.680
this one can take the cake and really we can make some memorable moments.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.360
But it takes a lot of time.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.360
It does.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.360
It does.

07:29.360 --> 07:33.600
We would really appreciate you guys supporting us and check it out.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.700
We'll put a link in the episode notes.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.440
I can't believe I just said that.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.440
That's...

07:38.440 --> 07:39.440
All right.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.440
Well...

07:40.440 --> 07:41.440
We're like a real podcast now.

07:41.440 --> 07:44.200
Yeah, I think we're making a podcast now.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.200
All right.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.840
Well, let's get to some questions.

07:48.840 --> 07:52.720
I was certainly blown away by the amount of questions that we received.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.320
And the level of insight in the questions.

07:55.320 --> 07:56.320
Absolutely.

07:56.320 --> 07:57.320
Y'all are smart.

07:57.320 --> 08:03.960
With that being said, let's start with a question from D. Tratara on Instagram.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.960
You know, just some listener I've never met.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.620
No one we know.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.120
He lives in Canada, apparently.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.520
What a weirdo.

08:10.520 --> 08:11.520
Yep.

08:11.520 --> 08:12.520
He asks...

08:12.520 --> 08:15.680
I wouldn't have liked to stand next to him at your wedding.

08:15.680 --> 08:21.280
He asks, what do you think of the notion that technological advancement has rendered selfhood

08:21.280 --> 08:26.760
artificial, therefore making one's identity changeable and plural?

08:26.760 --> 08:27.760
Now, I did...

08:27.760 --> 08:29.480
Can I actually field this one?

08:29.480 --> 08:30.480
Yeah.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.480
Go for it.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.480
Dakota?

08:32.480 --> 08:33.480
Yes.

08:33.480 --> 08:41.840
I asked Dakota to elaborate, and he said, well...

08:41.840 --> 08:46.080
It's evident digital technologies affect both the social and cultural spheres.

08:46.080 --> 08:51.160
As individuals present themselves across different social media platforms, they are able to construct

08:51.160 --> 08:56.800
various versions of themselves, i.e. bringing to the mainstream postmodern ideas, such as

08:56.800 --> 09:00.880
the self being constituted by multiple discourses and structures.

09:00.880 --> 09:05.280
Simultaneously, the technologies that allow for us to enact ourselves in cyberspace also

09:05.280 --> 09:07.880
allow for greater monitoring of our activity.

09:07.880 --> 09:12.640
Thus, the projection of ourselves that we voluntarily put out across these sites can

09:12.640 --> 09:18.340
be aggregated into a quote data double of ourselves, providing those with technological

09:18.340 --> 09:22.900
means to collect such data and a complete picture of who we are.

09:22.900 --> 09:26.260
How many times did you come while you were jacking yourself off there, Dakota?

09:26.260 --> 09:27.260
This...

09:27.260 --> 09:29.260
Hopefully at least once.

09:29.260 --> 09:34.220
Is the question he's asking like, are we the same on the podcast as we are in real life?

09:34.220 --> 09:35.420
Go ahead and answer that one.

09:35.420 --> 09:37.180
I would say, yeah.

09:37.180 --> 09:39.220
We're very bad cops in real life, too.

09:39.220 --> 09:44.380
No, I mean like, our like personalities, like, yeah, I don't think we really tried to change

09:44.380 --> 09:45.500
anything up for it.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.980
Like we just brought what we have to the table and...

09:48.020 --> 09:50.580
Well, you do that voice.

09:50.580 --> 09:52.100
Luke's character voice is pretty intense.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.100
His famous character voice.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.700
Hit us with that Keith Vigna voice.

09:55.700 --> 09:56.700
What's up, everybody?

09:56.700 --> 10:01.580
Oh, man, it's like he's in the room.

10:01.580 --> 10:02.580
Where's Luke?

10:02.580 --> 10:05.060
I'm Keith Vigna now.

10:05.060 --> 10:06.340
Follow up question.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.700
Will you ever do a character voice?

10:08.700 --> 10:11.020
If I get a new character?

10:11.020 --> 10:13.660
I think that's coming pretty soon.

10:14.300 --> 10:18.540
And it'll sound like this.

10:18.540 --> 10:19.540
I'm working on it.

10:19.540 --> 10:21.740
Yeah, I think that's a good starting point.

10:21.740 --> 10:24.580
Dakota also asked, what do we...

10:24.580 --> 10:25.580
We've got an...

10:25.580 --> 10:31.140
It seemed like, yeah, while I was in it at a point, it seemed like a good time to burp.

10:31.140 --> 10:32.140
Absolutely.

10:32.140 --> 10:36.700
We've got another question from fucks up invoker combos.

10:36.700 --> 10:37.700
What does that mean?

10:37.700 --> 10:40.900
It's gotta be a video game thing, but I don't think I play those kind of video games.

10:40.900 --> 10:45.180
All right, well, he would love to know, or she would love to know, they would love to

10:45.180 --> 10:49.380
know how Zach prepares for scenario campaign and session.

10:49.380 --> 10:50.620
Luke, do you want to take this one?

10:50.620 --> 10:52.260
Yeah, I'll take this one.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.260
He doesn't basically.

10:53.260 --> 10:54.260
No, no.

10:54.260 --> 10:56.300
How does he approach making a new story?

10:56.300 --> 10:57.740
How far ahead does he plan?

10:57.740 --> 10:59.840
How much is fleshed out before they start playing?

10:59.840 --> 11:04.100
How much does he prepare between sessions and how much is improvisation?

11:04.100 --> 11:07.700
So I'll start it out.

11:07.700 --> 11:11.100
The answer to this question is, dude, I really have no idea.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.620
All I know is that he does a lot.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.220
So I'll hand it over to...

11:14.220 --> 11:15.220
We should ask Zach about this.

11:15.220 --> 11:16.220
Zach would know about this.

11:16.220 --> 11:17.220
Oh, wait, real quick, Joe.

11:17.220 --> 11:18.220
Joe, what do you think?

11:18.220 --> 11:19.220
What do you think?

11:19.220 --> 11:23.140
It's pretty obvious that Zach would be the one to answer this.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.880
I agree.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.020
Isn't this podcast about subverting expectations?

11:28.020 --> 11:32.220
Hey, Justin, do you want to hop in on here real quick and what do you think?

11:32.220 --> 11:36.260
Zach Facebook messaged me and he says he spends very little time on this.

11:36.260 --> 11:39.260
He just wants that Patreon money for him.

11:39.260 --> 11:42.260
Okay, to actually answer the question.

11:42.260 --> 11:49.580
This is kind of a big question, I would say, but I will tell you that before we started

11:49.580 --> 11:50.580
recording...

11:50.580 --> 11:51.580
You're a big boy.

11:51.580 --> 11:56.420
I am a big boy with big answers for big questions and my name's Zach.

11:56.420 --> 11:57.420
Big butch boy.

11:57.420 --> 12:00.140
Are you ready for this big butch boy to answer your big butch questions?

12:00.140 --> 12:01.140
I want to hear it.

12:01.140 --> 12:02.140
Okay.

12:02.140 --> 12:03.140
Oh, God.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.140
I'm working on my new character voice.

12:06.020 --> 12:07.860
I love that new character voice.

12:07.860 --> 12:12.920
After our last campaign finished up, I knew I had at least two months to start writing

12:12.920 --> 12:17.800
something new and we had realized at the end of playing our last campaign that we wanted

12:17.800 --> 12:21.900
to record our next one for posterity's purposes.

12:21.900 --> 12:29.980
I began writing and I took inspiration from a lot of different things, but I knew that

12:29.980 --> 12:33.420
what we know is small town life.

12:33.420 --> 12:37.420
I feel like we consume a lot of content from that setting.

12:37.420 --> 12:38.420
We've watched Smallville.

12:38.420 --> 12:39.420
Exactly.

12:39.420 --> 12:40.420
We know.

12:40.420 --> 12:42.380
I'm from Ozark, Missouri.

12:42.380 --> 12:47.860
That's number two, is that we live in Missouri and I wanted to play a campaign in that setting.

12:47.860 --> 12:48.860
We'd never done that before.

12:48.860 --> 12:53.620
Delta Green is mostly a game where you're dealing in government agencies and really

12:53.620 --> 13:02.740
highfalutin stuff that is very redacted and you have to have a high clearance to get that

13:02.740 --> 13:03.740
information.

13:03.740 --> 13:05.460
I wanted to play with small town cops.

13:05.460 --> 13:09.340
I thought that would be really fun and it turns out-

13:09.340 --> 13:11.340
It was.

13:11.340 --> 13:14.380
With that being said, I began to build a plot.

13:14.380 --> 13:20.220
I knew that I wanted to mix in rules from Pulp Cthulhu with this campaign because I

13:20.220 --> 13:24.220
read the source book and it fucking blew me away.

13:24.220 --> 13:29.780
I was so into it from the very beginning, actually two years ago or maybe a year ago

13:29.780 --> 13:36.260
when it first came out, I, for my birthday, ran one of the scenarios from the back of

13:36.260 --> 13:41.940
the Pulp Cthulhu book and it was a shit show.

13:41.940 --> 13:46.620
Thomas and Justin were both there and we just drank too much.

13:46.620 --> 13:52.220
It was a birthday celebration but I think Justin and Thomas' characters ran off-

13:52.220 --> 13:54.100
To meet Ernest Timmingway.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.100
Because he owed-

13:55.100 --> 13:56.100
Oh, is it that one?

13:56.100 --> 13:57.100
Yeah.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.100
Oh, that was a good time.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.100
It was a good time.

13:59.420 --> 14:00.420
People were very upset.

14:00.420 --> 14:01.420
The hotel?

14:01.420 --> 14:02.420
I was too drunk to realize how-

14:02.420 --> 14:03.420
Yeah, I was there.

14:03.420 --> 14:05.940
Me and Zach, or me and Thomas got-

14:05.940 --> 14:06.940
You and I had a really great time.

14:06.940 --> 14:09.100
We got very upset.

14:09.100 --> 14:13.660
We wanted the story to go a certain way that no one else maybe did in the room.

14:13.660 --> 14:15.320
We were just like, wait, why are we here?

14:15.320 --> 14:19.700
Of course it's to fuck around for 15 minutes each turn while we're really drunk.

14:19.700 --> 14:24.100
Okay, so that's how good Zach is at this shit.

14:24.100 --> 14:27.680
When you're really drunk, we kind of forgot that it was a DM situation.

14:27.680 --> 14:29.720
We were just being these assholes.

14:29.720 --> 14:34.480
It was an extremely fun game, but I fell in love with Pulp Cthulhu right then and there

14:34.480 --> 14:40.560
from having all the different talents and the sanity losing skills that would arrive

14:40.560 --> 14:43.000
with sanity loss was really cool.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.800
I wanted to throw those in.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.800
I started writing this campaign with the items.

14:48.800 --> 14:49.800
That's interesting.

14:49.800 --> 14:55.920
I really liked the rules for the different magical items, but I wanted to put it in a

14:55.920 --> 14:58.400
more delta green setting.

14:58.400 --> 15:04.600
I started with the items that were in the trunk and I built the story out from there.

15:04.600 --> 15:10.960
There are about 35 characters that live in contention and in the city.

15:10.960 --> 15:15.120
They are all independent of each other with their own motives.

15:15.120 --> 15:21.960
I changed their wants and needs and motives based on everything that happens with these

15:21.960 --> 15:24.160
three police officers.

15:24.160 --> 15:28.440
Basically I have a doc sheet where I have all the different characters listed and then

15:28.440 --> 15:35.520
I change how the actions of these boys affect them week to week to decide how the story

15:35.520 --> 15:37.440
should progress the next week.

15:37.440 --> 15:42.240
As you've seen, I have what I learned from good friends of Jackson Elias.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.200
They call them bangs, I think.

15:44.200 --> 15:49.540
Somebody calls them bangs, which are basically just things that you throw in into a scenario

15:49.540 --> 15:53.600
and you force your players to deal with them.

15:53.600 --> 15:58.920
So I've basically wrote out all these different characters and what they're going through

15:58.920 --> 16:01.680
and then I write bangs each week.

16:01.680 --> 16:04.400
What's an example of a bang that's happened so far in the story?

16:04.400 --> 16:08.480
So far in the story, obviously spoilers in this episode.

16:08.480 --> 16:12.200
If you haven't listened to any of the podcasts up to this point, then...

16:12.200 --> 16:13.200
Stop listening.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.360
Yeah, go back to episode one.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.160
This is a chronological show.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.720
Should we record a little tag saying that right for the start?

16:18.720 --> 16:20.200
I'll have Wolf the Dog do it.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.200
Nice.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.200
Yes.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.800
No.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.000
I'll make Justin do it.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Oh shit.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.760
Wolf's gone Hollywood.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.400
I think we still keep him in the basement, so...

16:35.400 --> 16:36.400
So spoilers.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.400
Right.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.400
Where were we?

16:38.400 --> 16:39.400
You can't let him see the full moon.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.400
An example of a bang.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.360
An example of a bang is the body of John Peters falling onto your car.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.360
Oh yeah.

16:45.360 --> 16:47.520
So that was going to happen no matter what we do.

16:47.520 --> 16:48.520
Yeah.

16:48.520 --> 16:49.520
Yeah.

16:49.840 --> 16:55.360
It's like in storytelling it's like, would it be more realistic in this super unrealistic

16:55.360 --> 16:59.480
setting for that body to fall not on one of your cars?

16:59.480 --> 17:03.480
Probably, but it's a game and it's a story and it's way cooler if it falls on your fucking

17:03.480 --> 17:04.480
car.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.280
Oh, and that's not something I've ever even questioned as a player.

17:06.280 --> 17:07.280
Sure, yeah.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.280
Totally.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.920
So that is basically how I prepare.

17:10.920 --> 17:16.760
The scenario has seeds that I wrote two years ago, before the campaign started, probably

17:16.760 --> 17:17.760
two years ago.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.240
When do you think?

17:19.240 --> 17:20.240
What month of...

17:20.240 --> 17:23.200
Okay, so we started recording in December of 2017.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.200
2017.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.200
Oh my god.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.200
Yeah, right?

17:26.200 --> 17:27.200
Yeah.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.200
Okay.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.200
It's been a while.

17:29.200 --> 17:33.840
So we started, yeah, recording in December of 2017, so I probably started writing this

17:33.840 --> 17:39.440
in October of 2017 and some of the things that I've written have not come up yet in

17:39.440 --> 17:40.440
the show.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.440
Wow.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.440
Well, I'd hope so.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.480
So I have a lot planned.

17:45.480 --> 17:51.160
I have a lot of moving parts that I deal with and that is how much is fleshed out before

17:51.160 --> 17:52.300
they start playing.

17:52.300 --> 17:58.040
So for each session I try to brush up on what the people around them in their area might

17:58.040 --> 18:01.680
be doing and then if they try to go somewhere that I'm not ready for, I throw a fucking

18:01.680 --> 18:03.680
dead body on their car.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.160
Yeah, you...

18:05.160 --> 18:07.240
Oh, did you guys want to go to the mill?

18:07.240 --> 18:08.240
Really kept us away from that mill.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.640
Oh, did you want to go to the mill?

18:10.640 --> 18:12.440
Kept going to the mill and then it came up.

18:12.440 --> 18:17.040
You can abandon any responsibilities at any point in time and go anywhere, but I tried

18:17.040 --> 18:20.160
to make the responsibilities pretty top priority.

18:20.160 --> 18:26.040
That is what I've realized now that it's just like, if he does that, just go to the mill.

18:26.040 --> 18:27.040
Just go to the mill.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.640
Oh, oh, Chief Maggie's house is on fire.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.640
She's burning alive.

18:29.640 --> 18:32.720
Brian, care, we're going to the mill.

18:32.720 --> 18:37.600
One thing I, it's not really, it kind of has to do with the question, but like as far as

18:37.600 --> 18:43.760
like preparing for stuff, me and Joe and Thomas, you know, when we would be recording an episode,

18:43.760 --> 18:49.640
like we would go back through and like see what we'd done prior to recording that episode.

18:49.640 --> 18:54.880
So before we record, Zach usually writes up a little, uh, overview of what we did last

18:54.880 --> 18:59.840
time and that he has us be sure to read that before we start recording for the next session.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.480
That helps keep it all fresh in our mind.

19:01.480 --> 19:07.240
I sent an overview to everyone of everything that happened and I sent individual overviews

19:07.240 --> 19:10.120
for times when they were the only one in the room.

19:10.120 --> 19:14.200
And usually we would read those as soon as we got to your house and then we would record

19:14.200 --> 19:19.080
the next session and Joe, Joe would read them three times.

19:19.080 --> 19:24.160
This also brings up something that is kind of one of the reasons I thought we should

19:24.160 --> 19:25.840
have an episode like this.

19:25.840 --> 19:29.760
We recorded this, like he said, we started in December, 2017.

19:29.760 --> 19:36.700
The episode you just heard was recorded in November or December, 2018.

19:36.700 --> 19:41.400
We did this all over the course of the year, so if there's ever any time where we don't

19:41.400 --> 19:45.860
know what's going on in the podcast, like you're like screaming at your microphone or

19:45.860 --> 19:46.860
not your mic.

19:46.860 --> 19:48.220
Oh, you're just making excuses now.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.220
Oh, okay, cool.

19:49.220 --> 19:54.500
Uh, so I thought this whole Q and a would just to be about excuses.

19:54.500 --> 19:58.420
Here's why we're so sorry.

19:58.420 --> 20:04.100
There would be a significant time gaps between recording Thomas moved away for like three

20:04.100 --> 20:06.700
months after recording the first sessions.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.900
I was just gone for a while.

20:08.900 --> 20:12.720
If there's ever anything super frustrating that you hear that's like, why the fuck don't

20:12.720 --> 20:16.240
they know that it's probably just because they're stupid or why are they making that

20:16.240 --> 20:19.780
super outdated cultural reference?

20:19.780 --> 20:23.960
That was a personal, like I was listening to episode like we, we do some editing on

20:23.960 --> 20:27.140
our own tracks and I was listening to myself once and I was like, well, that's a fucking

20:27.140 --> 20:28.920
meme from like October.

20:28.920 --> 20:29.920
Like that's bullshit.

20:29.920 --> 20:30.920
Stale.

20:30.920 --> 20:31.920
Stale.

20:32.700 --> 20:37.200
And the last episode, I think we mentioned like, yeah, it's a kid from mid nineties and

20:37.200 --> 20:38.200
I'm like, that happened a little while ago.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.200
That was a while ago.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.200
Yeah.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.200
I still haven't seen mid nineties.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.200
It's fine.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.200
It's a, it's a.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.960
Oh wait, no, the one I really need to see is eighth grade.

20:44.960 --> 20:45.960
Yes.

20:45.960 --> 20:46.960
And I haven't seen that one either.

20:46.960 --> 20:51.800
It was May 7th, 2019 right now when we're recording this and we haven't seen eighth

20:51.800 --> 20:52.800
grade.

20:52.800 --> 20:53.800
Yeah.

20:53.800 --> 20:54.800
I have seen both of those.

20:54.800 --> 20:55.800
I'm sorry listeners.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.000
But anyway, let's go to another question.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
Which rules are they using from pulp and which are native to Delta green?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
I'll field this one.

21:03.000 --> 21:09.400
We are playing Delta green mechanics except for we have abandoned the bonds mechanic and

21:09.400 --> 21:13.680
we have picked up the luck rules from pulp Cthulhu.

21:13.680 --> 21:21.240
We are planning, Ooh, spoiler, spoiler alert for the next episode.

21:21.240 --> 21:25.880
We are going to add in some talents from pulp Cthulhu.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.320
Oh, very cool.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.240
I'm very excited about this.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.240
That's exclusive to us too, listeners.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.240
Let's move on.

21:32.240 --> 21:35.840
We've got a question from crush 36 real quick.

21:35.840 --> 21:36.840
Shout out to crush 36.

21:36.840 --> 21:37.840
Awesome.

21:37.840 --> 21:38.840
Awesome fan.

21:38.840 --> 21:39.840
Best fan.

21:39.840 --> 21:40.840
Thank you so much.

21:40.840 --> 21:47.120
Crush 36 created a subreddit for pretending to be people and it has freaked me out in

21:47.120 --> 21:48.880
a very good way.

21:48.880 --> 21:52.920
I once said when we first started recording, I think maybe the very first episode we were

21:52.920 --> 21:58.760
talking about goals of this podcast and we thought, I think that we would make it maybe

21:58.760 --> 22:01.880
10 episodes in probably before we stopped.

22:01.880 --> 22:07.560
However, that didn't happen and someone made fan art and it was, I was about to say, we

22:07.560 --> 22:09.120
had our first fan art.

22:09.120 --> 22:13.640
Crush did a sketch of Clark and boy was that cool to see.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.400
It was, it was pretty awesome.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.400
That was really awesome.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.640
Like a Mr Leahy meets Dale Gribble.

22:18.640 --> 22:19.640
Yeah, it was good.

22:19.640 --> 22:20.640
Oh my God.

22:20.640 --> 22:21.640
Yeah.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.680
Very, very similar to what I had pictured for sure.

22:23.680 --> 22:24.680
Oh wow.

22:24.680 --> 22:25.680
Yeah.

22:25.680 --> 22:26.680
Very similar.

22:26.680 --> 22:27.680
I pictured him a little fatter.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.680
That was the only difference.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.800
I pictured him a little younger, but I really liked the image I saw.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.120
I was like, Oh shit.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.760
He got, he got the balding thing.

22:33.760 --> 22:34.760
Perfect.

22:34.760 --> 22:35.760
That's exactly what I was picturing.

22:35.760 --> 22:36.760
As far as that goes.

22:36.760 --> 22:41.160
Taylor said that she pictured Clark Bishop with hair, but I guess she did role play with

22:41.160 --> 22:44.600
a, uh, a younger, a younger Clark Bishop who probably had hair.

22:44.600 --> 22:49.480
Well, also I just pictured Clark Bishop as Kenneth from 30 Rock as Jack McRae.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.480
No, that's Drew.

22:51.480 --> 22:52.480
That's Drew.

22:52.480 --> 22:53.480
That's Drew.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.480
That's Drew.

22:54.480 --> 22:55.480
Fat.

22:55.480 --> 22:56.480
What's his name?

22:56.480 --> 22:57.480
Shit.

22:57.480 --> 22:58.480
Jack McBrayer.

22:58.480 --> 22:59.480
Yeah.

22:59.480 --> 23:00.480
Well, okay.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.480
So if, if, if Andy Richter had Jack McBrayer's personality, that's what I'm thinking of.

23:02.480 --> 23:03.480
Yeah.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.480
That is incredible.

23:04.480 --> 23:05.480
Yeah.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.520
It was when I, when I saw that on the subreddit, I was like, dope.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.840
We have fan art now.

23:08.840 --> 23:09.840
Like that's, that's fucking wild.

23:09.840 --> 23:16.840
It blew me away and made all of the time and effort that I put into this really feel like

23:16.840 --> 23:17.840
it's heartwarming.

23:17.840 --> 23:18.840
It was extremely heartwarming.

23:19.840 --> 23:20.840
Yeah.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.840
Shout out to crush 36.

23:22.840 --> 23:23.840
Sorry.

23:23.840 --> 23:28.760
Crush 36 asks how far from the original storyline and vision have the boys wandered?

23:28.760 --> 23:33.840
Did major plot points have to get sacrificed to the altar of improv?

23:33.840 --> 23:35.640
Yes.

23:35.640 --> 23:36.640
A lot.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.960
Um, next one.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.160
Thanks for the question.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.160
The answer is a lot.

23:42.160 --> 23:43.160
Uh, no, for real.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.160
Yeah.

23:44.160 --> 23:48.000
Is there anything you can tell us about that without being too spoiler?

23:48.160 --> 23:52.400
Because I mean, obviously as players, that's something I really want to know.

23:52.400 --> 23:53.400
Okay.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.480
Here is the truth.

23:55.480 --> 24:02.800
We got together for a session zero two months after I had began writing this entire campaign

24:02.800 --> 24:06.680
and we got together, we had already been talking about characters and we'd already been talking

24:06.680 --> 24:11.360
about setting, but we were going to meet and record on mic, which I think we have recorded

24:11.360 --> 24:16.360
still us talking about what the characters were going to be, what the setting was going

24:16.360 --> 24:17.360
to be.

24:17.720 --> 24:18.720
We built the town.

24:18.720 --> 24:19.720
We built the town.

24:19.720 --> 24:23.800
I had a list of different kinds of businesses that would exist in a small town and we went

24:23.800 --> 24:31.160
through and I came up with a long time just town building, like just world building, world

24:31.160 --> 24:32.160
building.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.160
Yeah.

24:33.160 --> 24:34.160
Which is God so much fun.

24:34.160 --> 24:35.160
Was that okay.

24:35.160 --> 24:36.400
Uh, Oh God.

24:36.400 --> 24:40.000
This would be a more informed question if I could remember the name of the system.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.480
But do you know that, uh, that sci-fi RPG where everybody builds the world together.

24:45.480 --> 24:46.560
That's like the original one, right?

24:46.560 --> 24:47.560
The old school one.

24:47.560 --> 24:51.120
You can die during this is a pretty light one where everybody kind of roll some things

24:51.120 --> 24:53.360
and all the players help build the system.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.440
I was wondering if it was inspired by that at all.

24:55.440 --> 24:56.440
It super wasn't.

24:56.440 --> 25:03.240
Uh, I've just been, I've just been listening to a lot of different people talking about

25:03.240 --> 25:04.240
playing RPGs.

25:04.240 --> 25:10.480
I've been listening to a lot of different actual plays and I really took from them the

25:10.480 --> 25:14.920
idea of coming together for a session zero and world building.

25:14.920 --> 25:19.400
You also mentioned at the time that it would help us to have a familiarity with the area

25:19.400 --> 25:20.400
kind of built in.

25:20.400 --> 25:25.720
And it is awesome cause right now I'm looking at the map of contention hung up on the wall

25:25.720 --> 25:27.040
in the room that we're recording in.

25:27.040 --> 25:31.480
We've posted a few times on social media, the map of contention, but we did have one

25:31.480 --> 25:32.480
drawn out.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.320
Uh, it's, it's huge.

25:34.320 --> 25:39.040
The map that Zach made and he would point to where things were going on for us in the

25:39.040 --> 25:40.040
episode.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.040
Yeah.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.700
Cause the map was really important to me from the beginning.

25:42.700 --> 25:46.900
If you're playing in a small town, I thought it'd be really fun to see where everything

25:46.900 --> 25:47.900
is.

25:47.900 --> 25:48.900
Pages, clinkers.

25:48.900 --> 25:49.900
Yeah.

25:49.900 --> 25:50.900
All these different places.

25:50.900 --> 25:57.980
And uh, thankfully we have Justin who plays Wolf the dog and does the soundtrack for pretending

25:57.980 --> 26:00.540
to be people real quick.

26:00.540 --> 26:02.100
Give it up for Justin.

26:02.100 --> 26:07.580
You guys are too sweet.

26:07.580 --> 26:12.260
Somebody did ask the question, Oh, Brendan DePinto on Facebook asked, how long did it

26:12.260 --> 26:14.020
take to create the map?

26:14.020 --> 26:18.740
And so, I mean, I made the original sketch of the map, but recently a couple of weeks

26:18.740 --> 26:24.740
ago for those listening, but like two days ago for us, we posted the map of contention

26:24.740 --> 26:26.460
that Justin made.

26:26.460 --> 26:32.020
So basically I had Zach just send me a high res copy of the map, like taking a picture

26:32.020 --> 26:33.380
of it.

26:33.380 --> 26:39.780
And then I taught myself Adobe illustrator so I could make said map as a high resolution

26:39.780 --> 26:44.520
as possible because I really like whenever he would post stuff and he'd be like, this

26:44.520 --> 26:47.140
is where this episode is taking place.

26:47.140 --> 26:52.160
But I also wanted it to be like higher quality and a little more character added into it.

26:52.160 --> 26:57.380
So it took me like six hours or so to make it something like that cause I was also trying

26:57.380 --> 26:58.620
to learn a program.

26:58.620 --> 27:00.580
The splashylvania logo.

27:00.580 --> 27:02.260
It's the best thing on there.

27:02.260 --> 27:03.260
So fucking cool.

27:03.260 --> 27:09.320
If you haven't looked at it yet, zoom in on that because basically I took the like water,

27:09.320 --> 27:14.360
the wave aesthetic and like added that in and then just added these big, huge vampire

27:14.360 --> 27:15.960
chompers on top of it.

27:15.960 --> 27:16.960
It's incredible.

27:16.960 --> 27:17.960
It gets me going.

27:17.960 --> 27:24.720
And it was really fun to create little icons for all of these weird places and contention,

27:24.720 --> 27:28.320
kind of like a video game map almost is what I was thinking.

27:28.320 --> 27:29.720
And that's, that's exactly what it is.

27:29.720 --> 27:30.720
And it's like perfect.

27:30.720 --> 27:33.560
I think about this like a video game.

27:33.560 --> 27:38.400
I mean that's, I mean all video games essentially come out of the tabletop, like early RPGs.

27:38.400 --> 27:44.240
So right back to the major plot points that have gotten sacrificed.

27:44.240 --> 27:50.200
In that session zero, we were talking about the map and I was telling you guys about the

27:50.200 --> 27:54.400
piston junkyard because I knew that was going to be a place that we were going to go to

27:54.400 --> 27:56.160
pretty much right away.

27:56.160 --> 28:02.200
Speaking of bangs, very first bang in the whole show is a call from Julie Maxwell says

28:02.200 --> 28:04.680
there's a dead body in the piston junkyard.

28:04.680 --> 28:05.680
That's a bang.

28:05.680 --> 28:06.680
Boom.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.000
And so the story begins.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.140
During that session zero, I said, yeah, and there's a junkyard right here and it sits

28:13.140 --> 28:16.080
on an old mine.

28:16.080 --> 28:23.920
And Thomas said, Oh, is the super dark evil at the bottom of the old mine?

28:23.920 --> 28:28.120
And I said, no, I have to write that.

28:28.120 --> 28:31.920
It would have made things a lot easier for us if I had just shut up.

28:31.920 --> 28:36.880
So then I rewrote the entire campaign idea.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.200
I had not even thought about that.

28:39.200 --> 28:45.280
Because the evil was at the bottom of the mine, but now it's not.

28:45.280 --> 28:46.280
And I like that.

28:46.280 --> 28:53.360
So good job, Thomas, for punching up the whole campaign during session zero.

28:53.360 --> 28:59.760
So stuff like that, obviously, but once we got into the show, like I said before, I have

28:59.760 --> 29:01.200
all these different moving parts.

29:01.200 --> 29:06.480
So they basically interact with a fully working town in my mind.

29:06.480 --> 29:11.080
So that was a kind of improv out of the campaign.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.760
Has anything that major happened in the campaign?

29:13.760 --> 29:14.760
Well, yeah.

29:14.760 --> 29:19.680
I mean, we have to mention Keith's pants every once in a while, just to remind people how

29:19.680 --> 29:20.680
big they are.

29:20.680 --> 29:21.680
But I'm saying it's no.

29:21.680 --> 29:24.320
That's plot points that we came up with organically, but like, have you...

29:24.320 --> 29:28.280
Not even a plot point, that's just a bit.

29:28.280 --> 29:32.000
But nothing you've planned has been super changed by our actions?

29:32.960 --> 29:38.320
Every single thing that you do changes where the story goes, because I don't have a story

29:38.320 --> 29:39.320
in mind.

29:39.320 --> 29:43.320
I only have people and people who want things.

29:43.320 --> 29:45.820
And so the story isn't already written.

29:45.820 --> 29:48.820
You guys are the ones basically making that happen.

29:48.820 --> 29:49.820
So cool.

29:49.820 --> 29:55.480
I will say the most affected is every little thing that you mentioned about your characters.

29:55.480 --> 29:59.960
Every little detail goes into my little book about your backstories, which you've given

29:59.960 --> 30:04.680
me basically full realm to just go haywire on.

30:04.680 --> 30:07.680
It's kind of like the real book you keep on all of us as friends.

30:07.680 --> 30:08.680
Exactly.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.440
Which I heard that you found.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.400
And Thomas told me all about it.

30:13.400 --> 30:14.400
I was flattered.

30:14.400 --> 30:15.400
Thank you so much.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.400
I liked what I read in there.

30:17.400 --> 30:18.400
Okay.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.400
Well.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.840
You were so complimentary of all of our feet.

30:21.840 --> 30:26.080
That's why I don't take my shoes off at Zach's house.

30:29.960 --> 30:34.960
I just don't think about him that much myself, but I'm so glad you've noticed.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.720
He likes the smell.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.680
You guys were just born with great feet.

30:39.680 --> 30:40.680
What can I say?

30:40.680 --> 30:41.680
Thanks.

30:41.680 --> 30:42.680
You too.

30:42.680 --> 30:45.820
I am going to need a heat break and a pee break if that's okay.

30:45.820 --> 30:47.320
Let's go ahead and take a break.

30:47.320 --> 30:52.360
We will be right back after this word from our sponsors.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.680
This is Al from Al's Tires.

30:53.680 --> 30:56.160
I don't want to waste too much of your time.

30:56.160 --> 30:59.180
We have good tires and good service at good prices.

30:59.180 --> 31:01.960
Come on down and see us if you feel that's appropriate.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.320
Thank you.

31:03.320 --> 31:07.180
Here at Burgatory, we put three simple things into every meal we serve.

31:07.180 --> 31:12.300
Quality ingredients, service with a smile, and unquestioning faith in our undying Lord,

31:12.300 --> 31:13.620
Jesus Christ.

31:13.620 --> 31:17.160
We cook our patties the old fashioned way, medium or above.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.740
It's all undefined gray area here at Burgatory.

31:19.740 --> 31:22.420
Time is running out to indulge in our monthly specials for May.

31:22.420 --> 31:27.280
We're celebrating Cinco de Mayo with our seven layer dip and the Holy Guacamole burger.

31:27.280 --> 31:33.560
Don't forget to tell your amigos, Burgatory, come spend some time with us.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.600
Al from Al's Tires here again.

31:35.600 --> 31:39.400
Just wanted to let you know we're located just outside of contention on rural route

31:39.400 --> 31:40.400
six.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.180
If you pass the tiger sanctuary, you've gone too far.

31:43.180 --> 31:46.840
Come on down and see us if it's not too much out of your way.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.480
Thank you.

31:48.480 --> 31:49.480
All right.

31:49.480 --> 31:55.200
And make sure to get the product that was featured in that last advertisement.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.640
I love that product.

31:56.640 --> 31:57.840
I use it all the time.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.080
It's an extremely good product.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.080
I'm using it.

32:00.080 --> 32:04.160
I'm either wearing it or using it right now.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.740
Product make me happy boy.

32:05.740 --> 32:08.540
That product makes me extremely happy.

32:08.540 --> 32:10.360
I don't buy product.

32:10.360 --> 32:14.600
We got a question from the Robert Shippey on Instagram.

32:14.600 --> 32:19.040
He asks, Luke, why?

32:19.040 --> 32:21.600
Because it's fun.

32:21.600 --> 32:22.600
I love it.

32:23.600 --> 32:26.600
If I didn't do it, I wouldn't be doing this.

32:26.600 --> 32:30.600
Luke, you know other people exist, right?

32:30.600 --> 32:31.600
Yeah.

32:31.600 --> 32:39.000
I try not to do anything that is too detrimental to anyone else's fun.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
You never do anything detrimental to our fun.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.200
I'm playing a game to have fun and I'm going to do it for fun.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.280
It's only added joy to the group dynamic.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.720
I'm not playing a Dr. Denny Dennison.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.160
That guy was much more disruptive to the group.

32:54.160 --> 32:55.880
He was.

32:55.880 --> 33:02.840
Luke's last character was named Dr. Denny Dennison, AKA Worm Fingers.

33:02.840 --> 33:07.800
I hated pretty much everything about him.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.640
I was a doctor for a cult.

33:10.640 --> 33:18.600
I had a scat fetish that was developed through the game.

33:18.600 --> 33:21.440
I didn't plan it that way, but it happened.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.160
You really ran with it.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.160
Overall, just really creepy, terrible character.

33:25.160 --> 33:31.880
I actually specifically remember the first time that you acted out your scat fetish.

33:31.880 --> 33:38.680
You actually stood up in my kitchen in the dining room and you stood up and fully charade

33:38.680 --> 33:46.920
played out your interaction with a toilet and then I think perhaps masturbating to completion.

33:46.920 --> 33:50.880
And then he shat on your cat.

33:50.880 --> 33:54.520
All that's true until the cat thing.

33:54.520 --> 33:57.360
He was a doctor for a cult and that's all you need to know.

33:57.360 --> 33:59.160
So obviously that comes with the territory.

33:59.160 --> 34:09.600
So yeah, Keith Vigna is a pretty tame character for most of the characters I've played.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.760
Keith is pretty tame.

34:11.760 --> 34:16.880
I like playing a character that is not all there.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.640
I think you're doing it very well.

34:18.640 --> 34:24.760
I remember specifically when we were coming up with character ideas, you had this giddy

34:24.760 --> 34:30.040
fucking look on your face and you came up to me and you're like, I'm playing an idiot.

34:30.040 --> 34:33.280
And I was like, all right, well, which is easy for me to do.

34:33.280 --> 34:39.800
If the losers don't know, Luke is literally right now, he's saving up for a system of

34:39.800 --> 34:40.800
a down tattoo.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.800
That's not a joke.

34:42.800 --> 34:44.120
Yeah, that is completely true.

34:44.120 --> 34:46.520
He was also his high school valedictorian.

34:46.520 --> 34:47.520
I was.

34:48.400 --> 34:51.360
He went to school with a bunch of dumb asses.

34:51.360 --> 34:52.360
That's not true.

34:52.360 --> 34:55.880
I graduated a class of like 453 I think.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.560
I thought you were going to say like four or five.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.840
453, top of my class.

34:59.840 --> 35:02.960
Like you didn't know whether there were four or five people in your graduating class.

35:02.960 --> 35:07.560
I'm book smart, not smart.

35:07.560 --> 35:11.160
That's not what you are.

35:11.160 --> 35:15.720
We've got another question here from, I don't know how to say this, maybe oomph.

35:15.720 --> 35:16.720
I like oomph.

35:16.720 --> 35:24.040
OMF dash on Reddit asks, did Zach offer up insane options selling coke, killing your

35:24.040 --> 35:27.520
brother, thinking the guys wouldn't do it?

35:27.520 --> 35:31.280
I love the fact that the guys are kept in the dark on these solo side missions.

35:31.280 --> 35:32.280
Second question.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.400
Oh no, sorry.

35:33.400 --> 35:34.400
Not second question.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.920
I love the fact that these guys are kept in the dark on these solo missions.

35:37.920 --> 35:38.920
It started over.

35:38.920 --> 35:39.920
I already did.

35:39.920 --> 35:40.920
Yeah, he had it.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.440
That's the whole thing over again.

35:43.440 --> 35:48.600
Do it.

35:48.600 --> 35:51.200
Luke's the producer now.

35:51.200 --> 35:52.200
Look at me.

35:52.200 --> 35:53.200
I'm the captain now.

35:53.200 --> 35:56.080
He's like, I could just tell you didn't get what you needed, so you needed to do it all

35:56.080 --> 35:57.080
again.

35:57.080 --> 35:58.080
Zach, do it.

35:58.080 --> 35:59.080
Do it.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.080
Again.

36:00.080 --> 36:01.080
Do it.

36:01.080 --> 36:02.080
Do it better.

36:02.080 --> 36:03.080
But do it, yeah, do it good this time.

36:03.080 --> 36:07.280
Do you know that we all demand perfection of ourselves as our characters and you're

36:07.280 --> 36:10.480
just here flubbing these fucking pre-written questions?

36:10.480 --> 36:16.120
Did Zach offer up insane options, selling coke, killing your brother, thinking the guy...

36:16.120 --> 36:17.840
Matt Besser's Bjork.

36:17.840 --> 36:20.320
It's Matt Besser's Bjork, sorry.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.960
TM TM.

36:21.960 --> 36:28.140
So basically, yes, I offered them up thinking that they would make things more interesting,

36:28.140 --> 36:29.360
that's for sure.

36:29.360 --> 36:33.960
I didn't know that they would perhaps follow through with these things or whether they

36:33.960 --> 36:36.920
would help each other do them.

36:37.480 --> 36:44.600
Thomas, I certainly expected to at least ask for Keith Vigna's help to sell the cocaine

36:44.600 --> 36:48.960
perhaps, but I really didn't know.

36:48.960 --> 36:52.040
You misinterpreted our character development.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.040
Clearly.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.720
I don't really listen to the show.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.080
No, why would you?

36:56.080 --> 36:57.080
Because I don't think...

36:57.080 --> 37:00.560
I like to think that we're all friendly with each other, but I don't think that Keith and

37:00.560 --> 37:02.200
Jon are friends, really.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.820
Not the best friends, for sure.

37:03.820 --> 37:09.860
And also, now that I'm saying it out loud, he's the worst person you could bring in on

37:09.860 --> 37:11.580
a drug deal.

37:11.580 --> 37:16.960
But on this particular drug deal, he might have been a pretty interesting addition, which

37:16.960 --> 37:19.300
is, I guess, why you did that.

37:19.300 --> 37:22.740
Clark wouldn't do it, Keith would, but he'd probably fuck something up, so I think it

37:22.740 --> 37:24.780
was smart for you to just do it by yourself.

37:24.780 --> 37:28.220
I also just wanted five million dollars for my character.

37:28.220 --> 37:29.580
To no doubt.

37:29.580 --> 37:30.980
And not 2.5.

37:30.980 --> 37:32.700
I certainly...

37:32.700 --> 37:33.700
That's wrong, right?

37:33.700 --> 37:35.060
Well, you brought Drew in, and he's probably...

37:35.060 --> 37:36.060
That would be four people.

37:36.060 --> 37:38.340
I think Drew was probably the best option to bring in.

37:38.340 --> 37:43.180
I mean, you alluded to the fact that it would have been a much different encounter if Keith

37:43.180 --> 37:46.780
Vigna would have been there when the Duke came to sell cocaine.

37:46.780 --> 37:47.780
That would have been awesome.

37:47.780 --> 37:48.780
I should have asked Keith for help.

37:48.780 --> 37:50.380
Oh, well, yeah, because that was my brother.

37:50.380 --> 37:52.100
Yeah, it turns out.

37:52.100 --> 37:58.100
So we can actually get into the question now that someone asked, do the players ever listen

37:58.100 --> 38:02.260
back to the podcast, or is that something you don't do to keep yourselves in the dark

38:02.260 --> 38:04.260
about the things you don't know?

38:04.260 --> 38:06.380
I mean, that's up to you guys to answer.

38:06.380 --> 38:10.180
I definitely don't listen to the other guy's stuff, except just recently, Zach gave us

38:10.180 --> 38:15.500
permission to hear some of our solo mission stuff, because we were kind of far away from

38:15.500 --> 38:16.500
it in playtime.

38:16.500 --> 38:17.500
Exactly, yeah.

38:17.500 --> 38:22.980
It wasn't going to affect our roleplay at that point, and it was really, really cool.

38:22.980 --> 38:25.020
I think we kind of left it up to Zach.

38:25.020 --> 38:29.220
We were like, is it okay to listen to this?

38:29.460 --> 38:34.820
I think, for the most part, what we had recorded so far, he was like, it's fine.

38:34.820 --> 38:39.020
There were certain weeks where I'd say, don't listen to the dreams that other people are

38:39.020 --> 38:42.340
having, and then other weeks where I'd say, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:42.340 --> 38:47.940
It came out in-game recently that Jon had done that drug deal, Marvin Glass clearly

38:47.940 --> 38:53.060
accused him of it, and you guys immediately bought into the idea at that point.

38:53.060 --> 38:55.420
Same with me of killing my brother.

38:55.420 --> 38:59.060
I'm pretty sure no one had any clue that Jon was in on that.

38:59.060 --> 39:00.540
I think he denied that pretty well.

39:00.540 --> 39:01.540
Well, that was the thing.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.700
Up until recording this right now-

39:04.700 --> 39:05.700
Well, that.

39:05.700 --> 39:08.900
I mean, in the last episode, where Jon's just like, no.

39:08.900 --> 39:09.900
Yeah.

39:09.900 --> 39:10.900
Well, yeah.

39:10.900 --> 39:14.660
Up until recording this, we didn't ... Recording anything else up until this right now, we

39:14.660 --> 39:16.580
had no clue what each other were doing.

39:16.580 --> 39:17.580
During the recording.

39:17.580 --> 39:18.580
Right.

39:18.580 --> 39:22.180
That's something Zach requested, but it's also, I find it a lot of fun to be in the

39:22.180 --> 39:23.180
dark about what you guys are doing.

39:23.180 --> 39:24.180
Oh, yeah.

39:24.180 --> 39:25.180
It is super fun as a player.

39:25.180 --> 39:26.900
It leads to a bunch of really great roleplay moments.

39:26.900 --> 39:31.580
That was like ... Now, I do know that Coke Deal and you guys know that-

39:31.580 --> 39:33.660
Well, that it was your brother doing the Coke Deal.

39:33.660 --> 39:34.660
Right.

39:34.660 --> 39:35.660
Yeah, exactly.

39:35.660 --> 39:36.660
That was a reveal.

39:36.660 --> 39:37.660
We were all excited.

39:37.660 --> 39:38.660
Yeah.

39:38.660 --> 39:39.660
It surprised us all.

39:39.660 --> 39:40.660
That one hit everyone.

39:40.660 --> 39:41.660
Yeah.

39:41.660 --> 39:42.660
That was cool.

39:42.660 --> 39:43.660
It was awesome to know that.

39:43.660 --> 39:47.500
I think, Zach, you mentioned in the future, going into it, we're going to do-

39:47.500 --> 39:53.100
We got a little lax as we're releasing episodes, but I think it'll be more closed.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.100
Yes.

39:54.300 --> 39:59.220
As we move on forward, it's going to be just as closed as it was last time in the sense

39:59.220 --> 40:04.860
that while we're recording sessions, you guys won't be able to listen to each other's side

40:04.860 --> 40:06.380
parts.

40:06.380 --> 40:13.300
Within the context of the game, I think everyone's pretty well aware of the deaths of Keith Vigna

40:13.300 --> 40:16.380
and Clark Bishop and-

40:16.380 --> 40:17.380
With the look-

40:17.380 --> 40:18.380
What?

40:18.380 --> 40:19.380
What?

40:19.380 --> 40:20.380
What?

40:20.380 --> 40:21.380
Zach, what?

40:21.860 --> 40:28.860
And I mean, to be completely frank, John Lee Pettymore is in the den of Marvin Glasp, so

40:28.860 --> 40:32.060
do you think he's going to last super long?

40:32.060 --> 40:33.060
We'll see.

40:33.060 --> 40:37.660
However, I have made- I basically like all things with this story.

40:37.660 --> 40:44.060
I folded in what happens into the future, and so the fact that these guys have listened

40:44.060 --> 40:48.900
to certain things, I will make sure that story-wise, it makes sense that their characters know

40:48.900 --> 40:50.900
them, if that makes sense.

40:50.940 --> 40:53.540
You'll figure it out next week or the week after.

40:53.540 --> 40:58.660
The only thing you specifically expressed regret about is that we listen to some of

40:58.660 --> 41:00.940
Clark's recent things.

41:00.940 --> 41:01.940
Yes.

41:01.940 --> 41:08.060
Clark being inducted into the circle of knowledge is something that Thomas and Luke now know,

41:08.060 --> 41:12.400
but the characters they're playing do not, so that is one of the things that I am going

41:12.400 --> 41:19.340
to attempt to figure out a way to let their characters know while folding that into the

41:19.340 --> 41:20.340
plot.

41:20.380 --> 41:23.940
If we're getting much closer to when we're actually recording, that'll be a lot easier

41:23.940 --> 41:27.620
to manage, it'll just be a matter of you'll be saying don't listen to their section this

41:27.620 --> 41:28.620
week.

41:28.620 --> 41:29.620
Yep, exactly.

41:29.620 --> 41:36.700
Because I mean, we had 27, 28 episodes recorded until just now that we had to get through,

41:36.700 --> 41:39.260
so that's weeks of stuff.

41:39.260 --> 41:42.900
I hope we're still good at role-playing.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.540
I've kind of lost interest in it, honestly.

41:44.540 --> 41:46.540
Yeah, it's not my bag anymore.

41:46.540 --> 41:50.140
I'm more into Red Dead and Apex right now.

41:50.140 --> 41:51.500
Obviously, yeah.

41:51.500 --> 41:52.780
Weaving.

41:52.780 --> 41:55.140
What hardware and software do you guys use?

41:55.140 --> 41:57.620
We actually just upgraded our microphones.

41:57.620 --> 41:59.020
Yeah, this very episode.

41:59.020 --> 42:02.580
This here very episode you're listening to, we got ourselves some new microphones.

42:02.580 --> 42:05.180
Should we say out loud what it is or should we wait for the sponsorship?

42:05.180 --> 42:09.180
No, until we know that they don't suck, and until they give us money, we shouldn't.

42:09.180 --> 42:10.180
No, let's tell them.

42:10.180 --> 42:12.660
So we're super excited about that.

42:12.660 --> 42:18.180
Hopefully it'll cut down on the editing time for me and also make the listening experience

42:18.180 --> 42:19.180
better for you.

42:19.180 --> 42:21.660
Oh, don't do that.

42:21.660 --> 42:28.700
To answer the actual question, these are Samsung, not Samsung, Samsung Q2Us.

42:28.700 --> 42:30.980
Just for this episode.

42:30.980 --> 42:34.380
Yeah, that's not what we recorded on until this point, though.

42:34.380 --> 42:35.380
No, previously-

42:35.380 --> 42:37.340
So that can be a fun mystery for you.

42:37.340 --> 42:43.100
No, I will tell you, previously we were recording on the shittiest SM58 clones.

42:43.100 --> 42:44.760
Yeah, they were knock-off.

42:44.760 --> 42:46.220
They were trash mics.

42:46.220 --> 42:48.660
And that's what I've got right now because I forgot mine in my house.

42:48.660 --> 42:54.660
I'm glad you love the audio quality, you fucking peasants.

42:54.660 --> 43:00.500
So hopefully we'll be able to take it up another notch in the old quality section.

43:00.500 --> 43:09.620
Software-wise, we record into a Tascam Digital Porta Studio 2488 Neo that I have had in my

43:09.620 --> 43:15.500
home for four years that belongs to Justin's dad.

43:15.500 --> 43:20.020
Yeah, he wants it back sometime, probably.

43:20.020 --> 43:23.700
My dad, every six months, will be like, where's my Porta Studio at?

43:23.700 --> 43:25.020
What's he doing with it?

43:25.020 --> 43:26.500
He's not doing anything with it.

43:26.500 --> 43:29.780
He just is like, what if I want to record a whole jazz album by myself?

43:29.780 --> 43:31.220
What if I want a podcast?

43:31.220 --> 43:32.660
Justin, what's your dad's name?

43:32.660 --> 43:34.020
He can come over here and record it.

43:34.020 --> 43:37.100
Don't dox Justin, yeah.

43:37.100 --> 43:38.100
Justin Jr.?

43:38.100 --> 43:42.580
Shout out to Justin Jr. for letting us use his equipment.

43:42.660 --> 43:46.300
Justin's his dad's senior, and it's always been that way since birth.

43:46.300 --> 43:47.300
That was weird.

43:47.300 --> 43:53.340
It really gets into the time travel aspect we've just begun to get into on this podcast.

43:53.340 --> 43:54.340
Thank God.

43:54.340 --> 43:58.300
Justin is one of the dudes from the camera.

43:58.300 --> 44:02.180
And then software, I use Audacity to edit free and easy.

44:02.180 --> 44:03.180
Yep.

44:03.180 --> 44:07.460
Recently, Joe turned me on to Acid Pro 7, is that what it's called?

44:07.460 --> 44:09.060
I think it's 7.

44:09.060 --> 44:10.300
They might have 8 out now.

44:10.300 --> 44:11.300
I can't remember.

44:12.020 --> 44:17.420
It's an acid pro, and I got it in a humble bundle, is that what it's called?

44:17.420 --> 44:20.820
I used acid when I was a kid.

44:20.820 --> 44:21.820
And then the program is pretty cool too.

44:21.820 --> 44:22.820
That makes a lot of sense.

44:22.820 --> 44:23.820
Wowee.

44:23.820 --> 44:24.820
Advanced.

44:24.820 --> 44:32.700
Can you regale us with a story from your childhood?

44:32.700 --> 44:39.860
I also, when I record my Wolf the Dog parts, I use Reaper, which is really excellent and

44:39.860 --> 44:44.860
low priced if you want a pro quality digital audio workstation.

44:44.860 --> 44:45.860
And you're always on acid.

44:45.860 --> 44:47.380
And I'm always on acid.

44:47.380 --> 44:48.380
Which really helps.

44:48.380 --> 44:49.380
I'm never not on acid.

44:49.380 --> 44:51.540
We're going to take this moment to shout out microdosing.

44:51.540 --> 44:52.540
Microdosing.

44:52.540 --> 44:56.540
Brought to you by the Tanini B people.

44:56.540 --> 45:01.580
That humble bundle that did the acid pro, they've done that twice now, and both times

45:01.580 --> 45:04.380
it's been a ton of really great audio programs.

45:04.380 --> 45:06.780
I'm very excited to jump into it.

45:06.780 --> 45:10.060
And we have colored microphone covers.

45:10.060 --> 45:11.060
Mine's orange.

45:11.060 --> 45:12.060
Mine's red.

45:12.060 --> 45:13.060
Mine's green.

45:13.060 --> 45:14.060
Mine's blue.

45:14.060 --> 45:15.060
And mine's black.

45:15.060 --> 45:16.060
Justin's is black.

45:16.060 --> 45:22.340
All right, and just another reminder that this episode is going to be our release for

45:22.340 --> 45:27.340
the Patreon that we are starting for this podcast to keep us going.

45:27.340 --> 45:31.380
So hop on there, we'll put a link up on all the social media sites.

45:31.380 --> 45:36.060
If you don't follow us on Instagram or Twitter, we're at PretendingPod on there.

45:36.060 --> 45:40.540
And like we said earlier, Crush 36, did I get that right?

45:40.540 --> 45:41.540
Yes, you did.

45:41.540 --> 45:48.160
Crush 36 created a subreddit for us called r slash pretending to be people.

45:48.160 --> 45:52.660
And in case you need to know the details of the Patreon, what we're going to do is donate

45:52.660 --> 45:57.980
one individual donation at the highest level of the NPR donation level.

45:57.980 --> 46:05.200
And then we're going to share the benefits with everyone who subscribes to our Patreon.

46:05.200 --> 46:11.680
So $5 gets you the max NPR subscriber benefits.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.480
We still have to talk to Terry about that.

46:13.480 --> 46:16.280
That's our plan right now.

46:16.280 --> 46:20.400
So hopefully you're all very interested in that.

46:20.400 --> 46:23.800
Otherwise Luke gave $1,000 to NPR for nothing.

46:23.800 --> 46:25.240
Which that's fine.

46:25.240 --> 46:27.880
I got some socks out of it.

46:27.880 --> 46:28.880
It was a...

46:28.880 --> 46:29.880
A mug?

46:29.880 --> 46:30.880
Some socks.

46:30.880 --> 46:31.880
It was a...

46:31.880 --> 46:32.880
Do you have a sock pun?

46:32.880 --> 46:35.840
No, I have NPR socks that are...

46:35.840 --> 46:38.280
It's Calamari Shapiro.

46:38.280 --> 46:39.840
And it's Ari Shapiro's head on a...

46:39.840 --> 46:40.840
Calamari is squid.

46:40.840 --> 46:42.280
Oh, it's not made out of...

46:42.280 --> 46:43.280
Okay.

46:43.280 --> 46:44.280
I thought you meant scatman.

46:44.280 --> 46:47.740
It's Calamari Shapiro and it's Ari Shapiro's head on a squid.

46:47.740 --> 46:48.840
It's an actual NPR joke.

46:48.840 --> 46:49.840
I actually have those socks.

46:49.840 --> 46:51.640
Those are things you actually have, not a...

46:51.640 --> 46:52.640
Yeah.

46:52.640 --> 46:53.640
Okay.

46:53.640 --> 46:57.280
BF Evans 19 asks, do you approach playing a recorded session differently than when you

46:57.280 --> 46:58.280
play off mic?

46:58.280 --> 47:02.420
And he also asked, has there been any aspect of podcasting that has surprised you or been

47:02.420 --> 47:04.340
particularly interesting?

47:04.340 --> 47:09.980
And I noticed as soon as we all put on headphones, we became more respectful of each other's

47:09.980 --> 47:10.980
storytelling process.

47:10.980 --> 47:11.980
That's a great point.

47:11.980 --> 47:15.740
We didn't jump on each other's trains of thought as much.

47:15.740 --> 47:19.280
Let me just jump on that too.

47:19.280 --> 47:23.940
In the podcast, sometimes we do talk over each other a little bit, but not near as much

47:23.940 --> 47:26.300
as we would if it was not being recorded.

47:26.300 --> 47:27.300
Totally.

47:27.300 --> 47:31.220
When everybody else's voice is right in your ears, it is harder to do.

47:31.220 --> 47:36.140
And I still notice when we edit our tracks that we do it a lot.

47:36.140 --> 47:37.940
It happens, but...

47:37.940 --> 47:40.980
The thought process behind it is very similar though.

47:40.980 --> 47:49.620
I just try to not be an asshole and not always succeed, but try not to be an asshole to my

47:49.620 --> 47:50.620
fellow players.

47:50.620 --> 47:53.480
Yeah, it's not like we're all your best friends.

47:53.480 --> 47:57.180
I'm still trying to play the game or enjoy the game.

47:57.180 --> 47:59.420
I think that's as far as it goes.

47:59.420 --> 48:04.020
As far as playing or making jokes and stuff like that, I don't...

48:04.020 --> 48:06.980
Yeah, the bare bones of it are no, there's no difference.

48:06.980 --> 48:11.060
We're all joking with each other and pushing each other to do funny things.

48:11.060 --> 48:15.860
I mean, the reason we did this is that we thought we're great.

48:15.860 --> 48:18.460
You should hear it.

48:18.460 --> 48:21.460
There's a hell of truth to that though, that we all realized we had something special going

48:21.460 --> 48:24.140
on in those sessions we didn't record.

48:24.140 --> 48:25.180
We super enjoyed it.

48:25.180 --> 48:26.180
We all mixed together.

48:26.180 --> 48:31.060
And it was the first group, I think, with all of us that we were like, I want to play

48:31.060 --> 48:34.020
with this group as long as I possibly can.

48:34.020 --> 48:41.740
Speaking of which, we also had BFEvans19 ask, what are your backgrounds in tabletop gaming?

48:41.740 --> 48:45.260
Which I think we covered a little bit at the very beginning of episode one.

48:45.260 --> 48:47.580
But that might be not in everybody's mind.

48:47.580 --> 48:49.020
That was a while ago.

48:49.020 --> 48:52.060
So something we might not have covered in that episode though, actually, is I think

48:52.060 --> 48:56.500
almost all of us come to tabletop gaming through podcasts.

48:56.500 --> 49:00.140
That's what made me want to play these kinds of games.

49:00.140 --> 49:01.140
Absolutely.

49:01.140 --> 49:02.140
Not me, honestly.

49:02.140 --> 49:03.140
Yeah, not me either.

49:03.140 --> 49:04.140
Uh, definitely me.

49:04.140 --> 49:08.500
I was, uh, I got turned on to it all by Critical Role and I'm still a huge fan of theirs.

49:08.500 --> 49:13.180
Um, yeah, I saw them and decided that that was something I wanted to do.

49:13.180 --> 49:17.260
And then I mentioned this on the first episode, but Thomas kind of out of the blue, I don't

49:17.260 --> 49:19.620
think you knew that I was watching that.

49:19.620 --> 49:24.220
Just if I wanted to do a D&D game with some mutual friends.

49:24.220 --> 49:26.420
And yeah, it was just lucky, serendipitous heaven stance.

49:26.420 --> 49:29.820
And that was 2016?

49:29.820 --> 49:30.820
Kind of.

49:30.820 --> 49:31.820
Oh, I looked it up at the time.

49:31.820 --> 49:32.820
I think something like that.

49:32.820 --> 49:33.820
Yeah.

49:33.820 --> 49:38.620
Kind of when role playing was just, you know, it was becoming this very accepted deal, popular.

49:38.620 --> 49:41.580
We're not, we're not, uh, ostracized.

49:41.580 --> 49:42.580
Yeah.

49:42.580 --> 49:44.580
We're cooler than you.

49:44.580 --> 49:51.540
Well, I mean, like for me, I, I played, I said this in the first episode, but I played

49:51.540 --> 49:56.420
a D and D twice in high school, played it with a guy that was super serious with a group

49:56.420 --> 49:58.100
that was not serious.

49:58.100 --> 50:01.780
He did not invite us back to play with him.

50:01.780 --> 50:07.580
And I, uh, always was like, anyone that was playing it, I was like, if you have room for

50:07.580 --> 50:08.580
somebody, I'll jump in.

50:08.580 --> 50:12.820
But most people have like groups that are pretty set up and yeah, so I never really

50:12.820 --> 50:19.580
had the chance until I met, shout out to Alex, Alex, uh, he invited me to play with

50:19.580 --> 50:20.580
you guys.

50:20.580 --> 50:24.900
I think it was me, Alex, Taylor, Zach and Thomas at the time.

50:24.900 --> 50:27.940
Alex is the most handsome man we know he is.

50:27.940 --> 50:33.100
And I wish he was still here after me, Luke and Zach.

50:33.100 --> 50:37.780
But uh, yeah, that's all for, yeah, and just, he's top six, top six.

50:37.780 --> 50:38.780
Wow.

50:39.780 --> 50:40.780
It wasn't about handsomeness.

50:40.780 --> 50:42.780
Me and Joe got fucking thrown under the bus.

50:42.780 --> 50:43.780
You ugly fucks.

50:43.780 --> 50:47.220
It was just about who's friends with Alex, not.

50:47.220 --> 50:52.620
If you guys would, if you guys would like to see pictures of Joe or Justin, you can

50:52.620 --> 50:56.500
find them on our Instagram at at pretending pot.

50:56.500 --> 50:57.500
You be the judge.

50:57.500 --> 51:04.820
Oh, also if we get to 500 Patreon subscribers, there is a special boudoir picture of Thomas.

51:04.820 --> 51:05.820
Oh no.

51:05.860 --> 51:11.460
Oh, this is recently taken and it started my birthday off with a bang.

51:11.460 --> 51:12.460
Bang.

51:12.460 --> 51:13.460
Uh, yeah.

51:13.460 --> 51:15.460
Anyway, invited by Alex to play with them.

51:15.460 --> 51:20.180
I played one session or one campaign, I guess with them.

51:20.180 --> 51:22.360
Uh, it was super fun.

51:22.360 --> 51:26.300
We did it again and then now we're doing it again.

51:26.300 --> 51:27.300
Yeah.

51:27.300 --> 51:32.980
Uh, Justin here actually once texted me at 11 PM on a weeknight and was like, Hey, you

51:32.980 --> 51:36.260
know that Delta green thing that I've been talking to you about?

51:36.260 --> 51:40.900
And I'm like, I'm super down if, if, if you'll have me.

51:40.900 --> 51:46.840
And uh, he had me, um, and yeah, no, he, uh, he hit me up and I went over there and we

51:46.840 --> 51:49.780
roleplayed, we played a shotgun scenario.

51:49.780 --> 51:54.740
Uh, our friend Sam ran us through it as the first handler I ever had.

51:54.740 --> 51:55.740
Shout out to Sam.

51:55.740 --> 51:56.740
Shout out to Sam.

51:56.740 --> 51:57.740
Got me into roleplaying.

51:57.740 --> 51:59.700
Uh, Justin invited me over.

51:59.700 --> 52:07.060
The two of us played agents and we played through the scenario, uh, last things last.

52:07.060 --> 52:09.380
That scenario is fucking awesome.

52:09.380 --> 52:12.660
And it completely got me kickstarted into this game.

52:12.660 --> 52:13.660
Yeah.

52:13.660 --> 52:19.460
I, uh, I remember getting invited not by Sam actually, but by Tyler who was living with

52:19.460 --> 52:20.460
Sam at the time.

52:20.460 --> 52:28.260
Uh, no, Tyler, uh, Tyler Thrasher people might know him from Tyler Thrasher art.

52:28.260 --> 52:30.700
No curiosity.

52:30.700 --> 52:41.260
And as Zach's glares at me, dead face, I was just resting, I'm sorry.

52:41.260 --> 52:42.860
You show your fucking mouth, Thomas.

52:42.860 --> 52:44.740
How did you get into roleplaying Justin?

52:44.740 --> 52:49.980
Well, my friend, my friend Tyler Thrasher, uh, invited me and he's actually going to

52:49.980 --> 52:56.260
be Tyler Thrasher beam.

52:56.260 --> 52:57.260
They got married.

52:57.260 --> 52:58.260
He took his hand.

52:58.260 --> 52:59.260
They hyphenated it.

52:59.260 --> 53:06.160
Uh, he invited me and I did, this was maybe a year before I invited Zach and I was super

53:06.160 --> 53:08.540
into the idea, but I was kinda like, yeah, I don't know.

53:08.540 --> 53:12.460
It seems like it can seem impenetrable from the outside.

53:12.460 --> 53:15.780
Like like Luke said, people have these groups and you're like, I don't know if I'll fit

53:15.780 --> 53:16.780
in.

53:16.780 --> 53:17.780
I don't know what to do.

53:17.780 --> 53:21.380
It's like there's all these rules and rule books, but he made it really accessible and

53:21.380 --> 53:23.020
fun.

53:23.020 --> 53:26.720
And me and Zach had started hanging out and I was like, you're going to love this.

53:26.720 --> 53:31.540
There's a performative aspect to it, but it has all this like cool like world building

53:31.540 --> 53:36.360
and story stuff and all this other stuff and I just knew Zach would be hopefully super

53:36.360 --> 53:37.360
into it.

53:37.360 --> 53:40.900
And then that kind of started off a lot of this stuff, which is really interesting.

53:40.900 --> 53:44.880
And everything you just described is to me the strength of Delta green over a lot of

53:44.880 --> 53:47.660
other role playing systems.

53:47.660 --> 53:53.000
And also the strength of Zach as a DM is, well, I would say mostly the strength of friendship

53:53.640 --> 53:56.120
That's what binds us all together.

53:56.120 --> 54:02.400
Because like the most fun thing is getting to create this wacky, crazy story with friends

54:02.400 --> 54:07.640
where we don't have to play on the tropes of normal storytelling because we don't, at

54:07.640 --> 54:11.120
the end of the day, have tons of control over where the story goes.

54:11.120 --> 54:13.280
I mean, we roll dice all the time.

54:13.280 --> 54:14.760
What do you mean, we?

54:14.760 --> 54:16.920
And that's the beautiful thing about all role playing.

54:16.920 --> 54:17.920
Yes.

54:17.920 --> 54:24.920
Like for instance, in the hotel motel, Rosemary was going to slit Keith's throat open and

54:24.920 --> 54:30.320
Joe rolled a critical success on a persuade and that's what kept her from literally just

54:30.320 --> 54:32.800
like murdering Keith right in front of you guys.

54:32.800 --> 54:34.320
Keith, say thank you.

54:34.320 --> 54:35.320
Thanks, Joe.

54:35.320 --> 54:36.320
I regret it.

54:36.320 --> 54:39.320
I regret it to this day.

54:39.320 --> 54:42.920
Well, I'll think about that in the future.

54:42.920 --> 54:49.680
Well, I mean, also, I mean, in the last episode, like me shooting at the Kevin and missing,

54:49.680 --> 54:53.400
it's like that could have could have gone completely everything.

54:53.400 --> 54:54.560
Everything could always turn out different.

54:54.560 --> 54:55.680
Like crit success.

54:55.680 --> 54:56.680
It's awesome.

54:56.680 --> 54:57.680
Absolutely.

54:57.680 --> 54:58.680
Crit fail.

54:58.680 --> 55:04.600
You have something in your mind that you want to do and it's not up to me or to Zach whether

55:04.600 --> 55:05.600
it happens.

55:05.600 --> 55:07.340
It's up to purely a dice roll.

55:07.340 --> 55:12.980
Another thing, like another example would be when you guys asked about Julie Maxwell

55:12.980 --> 55:17.640
in the hospital after her drunk driving incident and I said, yeah, let me roll for it real

55:17.640 --> 55:25.320
quick to see if she's healthy and then rolled a 100 and she's so she died completely.

55:25.320 --> 55:28.620
I mean, yeah, the dice changed the game.

55:28.620 --> 55:30.460
It's so much people.

55:30.460 --> 55:31.460
Yeah.

55:31.460 --> 55:33.820
Pete, I'm getting really fired up about this.

55:33.820 --> 55:36.980
I'm tired of people on Twitter saying the dice don't change the game.

55:36.980 --> 55:37.980
I understand.

55:37.980 --> 55:42.860
They think that we write the scripts ahead of time and then have recorded them and mostly

55:42.860 --> 55:48.180
we do, but that's not for them to say and it's rude that they keep saying it.

55:48.180 --> 55:49.180
Okay.

55:49.180 --> 55:50.180
Let's see.

55:50.180 --> 55:51.180
What's the next question?

55:51.180 --> 55:52.180
It's rude.

55:52.180 --> 55:53.180
It's rude.

55:53.180 --> 55:58.460
I got a question from Lil Sleepy on Instagram has an important question.

55:58.460 --> 56:02.980
What is Clark Bishop's favorite Eagles song?

56:02.980 --> 56:03.980
It's gotta be Desperado.

56:03.980 --> 56:04.980
Desperado.

56:04.980 --> 56:11.800
Why don't you come to your sand sales?

56:11.800 --> 56:21.020
You've been out riding fan sales for so long now upon a band.

56:21.020 --> 56:23.900
Thomas, what do you think Clark Bishop's favorite Eagle song is?

56:23.900 --> 56:24.900
Desperado.

56:24.900 --> 56:28.060
How did you know?

56:28.060 --> 56:29.540
It's just a hunch.

56:29.540 --> 56:35.940
I think Keith Vigna's favorite Eagles song is Life's Been Good by Joe Walsh.

56:35.940 --> 56:36.940
Canonical.

56:36.940 --> 56:41.500
Joe Walsh was in the Eagles, so it's technically an Eagles song.

56:41.500 --> 56:46.120
I also played it when we were on cocaine earlier in the season.

56:46.120 --> 56:50.900
This is a little bit on the spot, but what is your character's favorite song?

56:50.900 --> 56:52.500
So I was actually going to bring this up earlier.

56:52.500 --> 56:58.060
Somebody asked about how we craft our characters and for me, a lot of times it's trying to

56:58.060 --> 57:02.660
think about what music they would listen to and I did not do that for Clark, so I can't

57:02.660 --> 57:03.660
do it this easy.

57:03.660 --> 57:06.140
I never knew you'd do that for any character.

57:06.140 --> 57:07.140
I love that.

57:07.140 --> 57:08.260
It's a really cool approach.

57:08.260 --> 57:09.900
What do you think it would be though?

57:09.900 --> 57:10.900
I don't know.

57:10.900 --> 57:11.900
I'd have to think about it.

57:11.900 --> 57:17.260
My old character Dash was this ex-military guy and I dove deep into like Three Doors

57:17.260 --> 57:25.060
Down and all those bands you hear in military commercials to get into that character.

57:25.060 --> 57:26.060
Wait.

57:26.060 --> 57:34.280
I'm trying to think of what Clark Bishop's favorite song is.

57:34.280 --> 57:37.820
It would be something that would show up on an easy listening radio station.

57:37.820 --> 57:40.100
It would not be terribly good.

57:40.100 --> 57:44.260
Just like easy listening, serious radio.

57:44.260 --> 57:46.780
The truth is that I bet Clark doesn't care about music much.

57:46.780 --> 57:49.700
I bet that's not part of his life and his recreation.

57:49.700 --> 57:54.500
He's the kind of guy who says, oh, I don't really care for music.

57:54.940 --> 57:55.940
It's like, what?

57:55.940 --> 57:56.940
What do you mean?

57:56.940 --> 57:58.540
I hear it when I hear it.

57:58.540 --> 58:01.260
He's more of a podcast guy.

58:01.260 --> 58:07.220
So I really like that you think of what your character would listen to before you create

58:07.220 --> 58:12.380
it and John Lee Pettymore was not created like that at all, but he is named after the

58:12.380 --> 58:15.660
Steve Earle song Copperhead Road.

58:15.660 --> 58:19.740
The very first line in that song is my name's John Lee Pettymore.

58:19.740 --> 58:23.700
Same as my daddy and my daddy before.

58:24.220 --> 58:29.140
I missed, I constantly over the recording of this got mistaken whether or not it should

58:29.140 --> 58:34.060
be John Lee Pettymore the third or the fourth, but canonically with the song, it should be

58:34.060 --> 58:35.060
the fourth.

58:35.060 --> 58:36.060
All right.

58:36.060 --> 58:37.060
Well, from here on out.

58:37.060 --> 58:40.980
That's John Lee Pettymore's musical background and that is also a song John Lee Pettymore

58:40.980 --> 58:41.980
would love.

58:41.980 --> 58:42.980
So.

58:42.980 --> 58:43.980
Yeah.

58:43.980 --> 58:44.980
Right.

58:44.980 --> 58:45.980
So you're the fourth now, right?

58:45.980 --> 58:46.980
You're like, you've always been the fourth.

58:46.980 --> 58:51.260
I'm pretty sure it started out as the fourth and I switched to the third fucking shit

58:51.260 --> 58:52.260
up.

58:52.820 --> 58:53.820
I can't believe you did that.

58:53.820 --> 58:54.820
Me either.

58:54.820 --> 58:59.740
Well, thankfully it's not a huge deal.

58:59.740 --> 59:06.260
Keith's would be, uh, his favorite genre of music is what can he sing at karaoke?

59:06.260 --> 59:10.780
Uh, so he likes cheeseburger in paradise.

59:10.780 --> 59:12.820
He loves the Doobie brothers.

59:12.820 --> 59:18.140
Pretty much any, any, uh, like yacht rock he's really into, but yeah, I would say cheeseburger

59:18.140 --> 59:19.940
in paradise, probably Keith's.

59:19.940 --> 59:27.460
And then I want to ask, what would Wolf the dog's favorite song be?

59:27.460 --> 59:28.660
It's obvious.

59:28.660 --> 59:31.500
I think I know what it is.

59:31.500 --> 59:32.500
It's kudzu.

59:32.500 --> 59:33.500
It's kudzu.

59:33.500 --> 59:34.500
Are you sure?

59:34.500 --> 59:38.380
I don't think he likes it very much.

59:38.380 --> 59:40.980
That's his purgatory.

59:40.980 --> 59:48.060
I imagine Wolf the dog sits in a corner and just listens to a low hum and he just turns

59:48.060 --> 59:54.700
on whenever like the radio signals are active.

59:54.700 --> 59:57.180
Also shout out to kudzu.

59:57.180 --> 01:00:03.100
If you haven't gone and listened to them on bandcamp or on Spotify now to Spotify and

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:09.820
bandcamp, they have more songs than no backbone and they have better songs and no backbone

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:10.820
on us.

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:14.740
Oh, almost all those songs are better than the backbone, but ours is just, we picked

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:15.740
the worst.

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:16.740
Yeah.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:17.740
Ours is just good for a podcast.

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.900
And I don't care that you think it's the worst.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.060
I'm going to use it as the theme song.

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:25.020
And they said, no, please take one of our other songs.

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.180
All this stuff is way more jazzy, funky.

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.180
It's a little...

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:31.460
They're a pop punk band.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.620
Little jazz trio named kudzu.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.860
No, but go check them out.

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:37.860
They're great.

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:38.860
They are amazing.

01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:42.620
One of the best bands out of a really great town for local music.

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.620
Absolutely.

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:46.920
We do have a lot of great, great bands out here.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:50.960
We will mention them later on in the podcast.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:57.120
So guys, thank you for listening to this Q&A episode.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:01.320
Basically this is our announcement for the Patreon that we're going to do to keep the

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.700
show alive.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.720
We really want to keep the show alive.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.720
Yeah.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.580
We're really happy doing it.

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:12.620
We really enjoy doing it and you know, if we don't make it, that's fine.

01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:16.900
We'll just keep recording and I'll send all the edits to the boys and we'll have a really

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:19.700
fun home game.

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:22.900
With lots of cool...

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:40.140
So with all that being said, we did say this was a recap episode and we did do some recapping

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:42.380
within answering some of the questions.

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:50.940
We did some spoilies and whatnot, but I am here today to finish this episode with a full

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:57.620
recap of everything, maybe not quite everything, but everything that's happened in the show

01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:00.960
so far.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.100
Keith Vigno wears large pants.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.820
He wears suspenders as well as a belt.

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:08.220
Drew has lots of gum showing like his top lip is receding.

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.500
Dogs are howling in the old neighborhood.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.100
It's the chief's birthday.

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:14.340
Drew brought her a yellow journal.

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:16.420
Now you have all three colors.

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:18.020
Clark got her a box of chocolates.

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:21.180
John gives her two thirds full bottle of cheap bourbon.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.420
Keith Vigna didn't get the chief a birthday present.

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:27.060
She did, however, receive a box with a single rose, a white hard hat and a black silk bow

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.580
tie before leaving town.

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.660
I'm so sorry.

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.140
Is it going to be this detailed?

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:32.420
No, it's absolutely not.

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.720
Julie Maxwell called in to report a dead body at the piston junkyard and then crashed your

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.580
car driving drunk and was pronounced dead at the city hospital.

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:43.580
The body found at the piston junkyard had a brand on the back reading, this is a fool.

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:47.840
Councilwoman Carrie Page's dog is missing and she is pissed.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.460
Jimmy Sanders saw an oil spill while tripping on mushrooms.

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:54.700
Mildred Mitchell, that old kooky pot head, saw a bright flash of light from across the

01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:56.540
street in John Peter's house.

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.540
John Peters is missing.

01:02:58.540 --> 01:02:59.540
Herdy at a long...

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.540
The farmer?

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.540
God damn it.

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:02.540
Herdy at a long...

01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:03.540
That's the one thing we didn't address.

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.540
That's such a bummer.

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:05.540
We didn't mean to do that.

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:06.540
I completely forgot.

01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:09.700
I haven't listened to Night F Fiddle in so long, but that's my bad.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:12.500
It's just conscious, subconscious, weird thing.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.500
My bad.

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:14.500
Sorry, I made it confusing.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:15.500
Just a plain ass name.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.500
John Peters is missing.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.260
Herdy at a long stay in the hospital a couple years ago.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:24.400
Two people came to John Peters' house, packed a trunk into their white Toyota and took off.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.540
The officers went to Chief Maggie Cook's house.

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:27.540
She wasn't there.

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:30.780
They went to Klinker's, the bar run by Harry Klinker with a daycare in the back.

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:33.940
When Keith was a child, he liked to cut up hot dogs on white bread.

01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:38.180
Julie Maxwell had a restraining order put out against Leo Piston back 15 years ago for

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:39.900
killing her sister Ashley.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:44.040
John found the chief's blue notebook, but her red and yellow notebooks were missing.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.700
Some idiot at the city hospital fucked up and put Julie Maxwell in the morgue.

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.060
She came to and started screaming.

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:54.120
County said that the body from the junkyard had the organs of someone who died 200 years

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.700
ago but the skin and hair of someone who died yesterday.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:00.900
Charles, a drunk man and friend of the missing John Peters, went to the police station to

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:04.640
get answers before pulling a gun and running away upon hearing the sound of a car crash

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.060
in the parking lot.

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:08.620
Kathy Piston shot Keith Vigna in the foot.

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:12.580
He snooped around her property until trying to stow away on her school bus full of homeless

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:13.580
people.

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:16.300
He heard himself falling from the emergency hatch in the back.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:21.060
John Lee Pettymore seems to believe some hooded robot man gave him a message.

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:26.340
The crash in the police station parking lot was a stolen black SUV t-boning George Piston's

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:30.020
truck while it sat parked in the police station lot.

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:34.980
Julie Maxwell, back from the dead, kidnapped Leo Piston and took him to Splashylvania.

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:38.460
She shot Leo Piston at the top of the two-fanged plunge.

01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:41.440
Officer Clark Bishop then shot and killed Julie Maxwell.

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:45.300
The two bodies were slammed into the ground by an unseen force before disappearing.

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:48.460
Officer John Lee Pettymore took a weird picture of the missing John Peters.

01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:52.420
Drew Andrews, upstanding citizen and police station secretary, translated the binary that

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:55.100
the hooded robot man gave John.

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:58.020
It said, I killed the chief's pops, John.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.180
Keith is in a wheelchair.

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:02.880
The officers broke into John Peters' storage units and found lots of things.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:07.480
One thing they found was so smelly they decided not to open it until back at the station because

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.100
they wanted the station to smell bad.

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.900
They took everything back to the station in a U-Haul.

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:17.620
In the nasty plastic trunk, a woman's head, split in half with a small sphere in the middle,

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:20.680
sat upon what was likely her own chopped up body.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.940
John pocketed it.

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:25.620
The officers went to the woods, found a patch of land that had been burned to the ground,

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:29.700
realized they were being watched, freaked out, wrecked the four-wheeler, ran into trees,

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:36.460
and overall just super fucked up, including Clark flying a drone into himself.

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:40.860
Then they went to Julie Maxwell's, wore her taxidermy, found a circled yellow pages

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:45.300
ad for Dr. Marie Jacobs and a receipt from Forgotten Treasures, a local flea market.

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:49.400
They went to Forgotten Treasures and found the camera Julie Maxwell purchased was from

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.160
Mildred Mitchell's booth.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.560
They went to Mildred's house.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.620
She didn't know about the items recently sold at her booth.

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:59.080
She assumes her granddaughter, Tildy B. Mitchell, was selling things at her booth.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:03.480
Tildy B. Mitchell came downstairs, freaked out when she saw cops, and ran into her room.

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:07.920
But when Clark busted in, Tildy B. pointed the strange gun at him and then disappeared

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.400
in a massive flash of light.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:15.520
Is it realistic that Tildy B. was selling the things at a flea market and not on Etsy?

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.960
They went to Forgotten Treasures and bullied the nice lady there until she put her own

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:22.220
life in danger by telling the cops about the drunk man who threatened her.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:26.440
Upon leaving, the white Toyota they had been searching for peeled out onto the road after

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.920
a short, dangerous pursuit.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:32.220
Keith Vigna gunned down Charles Donovan, John Lee Pettymore fired warning shots into the

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:37.120
air as well as Clark's tires, and they found a bald man tied up in the trunk.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.240
Keith took the ambulance with the unconscious bald man to the clinic.

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.120
Officers Bishop and Pettymore headed to the suburbs to chat with Dr. Marie Jacobs when

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:49.520
they saw an unkempt man, who we now know as James the mill worker, frantically vacuuming

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.640
his lawn.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.200
This ended in tragedy.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.760
But Clark, John, and James all made it out with their lives.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:00.780
Our brave and heroic contention police officer, Keith Vigna, was made unconscious by Billy

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:05.760
Harrison, the man found tied up in the trunk of Charles Donovan, the drunk who threatened

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:10.840
the woman at Forgotten Treasures, both of which told officers they were friends of John

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:11.840
Peters.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.520
Dr. Marie Jacobs seemed to be up to no good.

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.960
Officers Bishop and Pettymore found man-sized fecal matter in the litter box, and the doctor

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:26.360
yelled, Salem, prompting something to begin running up the stairs from the basement.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:32.840
The talented and beloved contention police officer, Keith Vigna, found himself sans uniform,

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.220
weapon, and cruiser at the clinic.

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.240
He had to call his partners to pick him up.

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:41.400
Meanwhile, officers Bishop and Pettymore detained Dr. Marie Jacobs and her blood-covered

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:46.280
husband Doug Jacobs in a cell at the contention police department.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:50.760
Officer Vigna and the two other idiots busted into the deceased Charles' room at Hotel

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.920
Motel, guns drawn in sans warrant.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:59.200
There they found a woman dressed similarly to her favorite TV character, the Fonz.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:04.360
The woman we now know as Rosemary whipped a knife out at Officer Vigna after these so-called

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.580
peacekeepers pulled their guns out.

01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:11.700
The party had Rosemary pinned down until the brilliant Keith Vigna engaged her in hand-to-hand

01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:14.820
combat resulting in a hostage situation for the copper.

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:20.100
Vigna, an officer of the law, proceeded to brag about killing her coworker, but the sweet-talkin'

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:24.860
officer Bishop managed to keep her from killing him there on the spot.

01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:29.580
When the old, wiry lady made a run for it over the railing and into the parking lot,

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:33.900
all three officers unloaded their weapons from the second-floor corridor, bringing her

01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:36.620
down before she could get into her vehicle.

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:41.980
The officers patched her up and sent her to the hospital with Lauren, the only decent

01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:43.980
officer left in contention.

01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:47.940
The officers planned a sting operation to catch Billy Harrison, the stranger running

01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:51.320
about contention who's wearing an official police uniform.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.820
The sting operation was actually a good idea, but the FBI was watching and stepped in on

01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:55.820
the whole thing.

01:08:55.820 --> 01:09:00.500
Agents Kennedy and McKinley were in town looking for a black Nike bag with nothing in it.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:04.660
The federal agents have agreed to meet the contention squad tomorrow morning, December

01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:06.460
4th at the police department.

01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:09.900
When the party met up at the station to figure out what to do with their illegal seizures,

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:14.180
Drew was uncommonly not at his desk, replaced instead by a note telling them he went to

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:15.600
the chief's house.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:19.780
Officers Bishop and Pettymore hauled off the undocumented loot to their individual residences

01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:22.220
while Keith went to the chief's house to check on Drew.

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:26.100
Officers Bishop and Pettymore were soon called to the chief's house after it had exploded,

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:31.100
leaving the unconscious Officer Vigna and Drew Andrews on the cold yard.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:36.100
That explosion also left behind the burned bodies of Harold Dorsey, Chief Maggie Cook,

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:40.540
and an unkempt man with a bullet hole in his head and his face in a pile of foot meat.

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:44.940
That man we now know as James the Mill Worker.

01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:47.780
Officer Bishop learned that the chief's car had been in the mill on the other side of

01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:50.060
the city since the night of December 1st.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:54.260
The County Coroner reports that during the investigation of an active crime scene, Officer

01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:59.100
John Lee Pettymore of contention slipped and shoved a possible murder weapon into the

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:04.020
eye socket of the deceased Chief Maggie Cook, fumbling and digging around atrociously as

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:09.140
the charred bones themselves began to crumble to no longer be a part of the situation.

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:10.140
No.

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:15.880
Officer Vigna broke into Officer Pettymore's house to find some cocaine for personal use.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:20.860
This is cocaine they stole from a storage unit after finding the key at the home of

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:23.820
a missing person, that missing person being John Peters.

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:28.080
The fire at the city hospital has now claimed the lives of more than 20 individuals.

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:30.460
The names of the deceased are not yet being released.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:34.780
More importantly, however, the officers take a while to order breakfast, finally deciding

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:39.980
on Bishop's big bean breakfast from beans on beans.

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:44.580
The officers are also dealing with a situation where an Officer Bishop seems to be in more

01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:46.300
than one place at a time.

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:48.740
He has no recollection of this.

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:54.860
The FBI agents come in, use the Nike bag by dropping in a small silver sphere, making

01:10:54.860 --> 01:11:00.100
sure not to touch it, and then recruit the officers into some unknown organization by

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:04.140
giving them a phone number and telling them to eliminate the threat and keep it all out

01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.140
of the news.

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.540
It's all probably fine.

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:08.540
Flashback!

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:12.060
Clark found himself locked in the public library with Gerald Fingerson as the sky turned completely

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.060
dark.

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.900
The doors were locked by a cloaked figure who began chasing after a tall man in a suit.

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:20.420
That sadly was not the worst of it because Clark got back home only to find his reality

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:26.780
shattering, eventually remembering the confession of the woman who killed his parents.

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:31.340
Back in current times, the officers went to the Daily Fuh after Gary Daley called in to

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.900
report information about the Chief's disappearance.

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.820
They learned the Chief arrived to her home accompanied by James the mill worker and another

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:40.060
man who held them at gunpoint.

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:43.820
The gunman was an all black and had a scar over his eye.

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:48.620
Gary Daley saw this man because he was following Harold Dorsey, the writer from the city who

01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:51.260
took Drew to the Chief's home.

01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:56.440
The officers, always utilizing their time efficiently, spent a while asking Gary Daley

01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:02.180
about the art he has hanging in his restaurant.

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:03.180
That was relevant.

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:09.260
John Lee and Don D. Pettymore gave us a glimpse into the accident that propelled John into

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:10.960
a life of civic duty.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:14.840
They were chased by a couple of giant, gaunt, suited men that seemed to vanish when the

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:19.640
pair of Pettymores came across John's nemesis, Large Eddie, roughing up Don's car in the

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:21.520
parking lot.

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:26.720
The altercation ended with a deliriously concussed John Lee Pettymore seeing his second cousin

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:32.340
father figure scorch Large Eddie's fist with only his hand.

01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:35.400
Back in the current timeline, the officers went to the First Church of Contention which

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:40.400
was hosting a lunch for anyone who needed it made by the pastor's wife and children

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.480
served by the youth group.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:48.160
The officers, well, Keith, broke into Pastor Adam Kane's office, stole the motorcycle

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:52.400
helmet he bought from Mildred Mitchell's booth at Forgotten Treasures, and learned

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:58.360
that he is working on legislation to allow motorcyclists to ride without helmets.

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:02.940
Turns out, maybe Keith is a monster to be around because his dad was a dick who clearly

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:05.040
preferred Keith's older brother Ferguson.

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.040
Or he's played by Luke.

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.120
That's not an excuse.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.700
Pastor Vigna is the worst person in contention.

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:16.440
While playing on their family sprawling estate, Keith and Ferguson heard the sirens blaring

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:21.040
as strange, gaunt men in suits appeared to fall from the sky and were shot down by the

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.680
Bean's personal security.

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:27.880
Later that night, William Beans gave Ferguson a watch and told him about a prophecy that

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.900
says he will save the world.

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:33.420
Back in whatever year it is now, the officers took the pastor's helmet to the police station

01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:37.620
and locked it up with the other items from the booth at Forgotten Treasures.

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:41.620
The light on the camera was green, so John took a picture of Keith outside the station.

01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:51.260
Unsurprisingly, the Keith was not of Keith, the picture was not of Keith, but of two men

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:57.780
in a strange room that lacked color.

01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:01.140
On the way to the mill on the other side of the city, John saw something strange in the

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:07.460
sky causing a fiery three car wreck on the main longitudinal drag of contention.

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:12.280
A minivan was run off the road by Officer Pettymore, a former teen sprint car racer

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.360
who was banned from the circuit after an accident that left multiple bystanders hospitalized.

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:23.220
The minivan flipped and caught fire.

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:26.320
Officer Bishop pulled a young boy from the fiery wreckage.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.820
The boy is at the clinic in critical condition.

01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:33.860
The minivan then combusted, killing the driver and other passenger who were both trapped

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.180
in the vehicle.

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:40.020
Officer Vigna made it out with a concussion, a broken nose, and the memories of a particularly

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:43.900
traumatic childhood Christmas.

01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:48.060
A vocal group of the contention population are protesting and letting these officers

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:49.540
know how they feel.

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:53.620
Drew apologized to the officers for not passing along critical information like calls about

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:58.260
missing persons, animals in the ponds and creeks, and a voicemail from the feds.

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:02.020
Doug, Dr. Marie Jacobs' husband who is currently inhabiting the body of their cat Salem, showed

01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:08.340
the officers the animals are hiding in the water because the oily substance cannot get

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.420
them in the ponds and creeks.

01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:15.660
Randy Angst, dentist, estate salesman, and historical society member, also lover, revealed

01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:19.540
some interesting information to the officers about the picture from the odd camera John

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:24.700
found in Julie Maxwell's car as well as about Cole's orphanage.

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:28.380
In James the Millworker's house, they found a cache of guns hidden under the coffee table,

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:32.140
a bunch of cleaning supplies and random materials, and a small enclave behind an oil painting

01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:36.620
of a rose, a few loose tiles in the kitchen where something buried has been dragged out,

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:42.300
and a 12-foot deep pit under a trap door with two corpses and an officer Clark Bishop at

01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:43.300
the bottom.

01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:44.540
I always am.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:49.760
A heavy artillery weapon is being fired into the house from the front yard.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:53.460
Then we had combat from the time the robot man blasted the door from its frame to when

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:57.620
the robot man almost cut Officer Bishop's arm off to when the robot man froze at the

01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:01.540
command of Officer Pettymore to when the robot man's torso flew out the window, gripping

01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:03.940
the throat of Officer Vigna.

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:05.540
Skyrockets in flight, baby.

01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.260
Show me armogato.

01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:10.980
Thank beans he poked that Terminator top in the eye just in time to escape before the

01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:15.940
metal fella exploded like fireworks earlier in the evening.

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:20.020
The officers then cleaned themselves up after fighting a large robot man with feelings,

01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:21.020
perhaps?

01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:27.220
Keith Vigna found a single piece of music called The Rise of the End in the bench of

01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.780
the stringless piano.

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:33.260
Clark Bishop found in the flipped-over coffee table blueprints for Calm Comfy Campground,

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:37.900
a suspiciously planned-out set of seven buildings, six encircling a large one in the center that

01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.980
sits on Lake Calm.

01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:45.120
A similar design was found drawn on a piece of paper in the pocket of one of the two corpses

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:49.060
they found in the pit under the trap door that Bishop fell into.

01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:52.660
Sitting in James the Millworker's house, the officers remember that he died in Chief

01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:57.160
Maggie Cook's house with a bullet in his head, face down, and a plate of foot meat.

01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:01.000
They also remember the contents of the present that she received from an unknown source the

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.980
night she took off, the red rose, the white hard hat, and the black silk bowtie, all of

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:10.540
which were present in this home in a painting on a suit of armor and worn by a statue, respectively.

01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:17.220
After undressing the bottom half of the still-standing robot man, the gang finds a logo on the smooth

01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:18.500
pelvic area.

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:21.780
It is an M made out of four double helices.

01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:26.740
They voted and decided to store the legs in Keith's cruiser trunk.

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:28.780
Keith's cruiser's trunk.

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:32.740
After officers Bishop and Vigna had the most uncomfortable dinner since the last supper,

01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:35.140
some really plot-heavy shit went down.

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:37.580
Keith Vigna was approached by his niece, Frances Beanes.

01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:41.380
Upon accepting her proposal, the two are driving east, away from contention.

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:46.340
John Lee Pettymore and Drew Andrews bonded over a shared fortune after a smooth transaction,

01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:51.020
and Clark Bishop saw an impossibility out of his own window and then woke up in an unfamiliar

01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:53.700
place with an unfamiliar face.

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:58.820
Officer Keith Vigna convinced a woman to murder Ferguson, his handsome and well-dressed brother.

01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:02.440
He then murdered that woman and stole the watch that was passed down from William Beanes

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:06.940
off of Fergie's corpse, then he laid in his bed at Hotel Motel.

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:10.780
Officer John Lee Pettymore and Drew Andrews were being held hostage by Rosemary, who works

01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:14.460
for Marvin Glass, after she killed two of the Pettymore cousins.

01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:16.860
Clark Bishop was inducted into the Circle of Knowledge.

01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:19.900
There, he ran into a mysterious woman from his past.

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:25.700
Clark then headed back to contention in a cab from the mill on the other side of the city.

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:29.580
The officers met back at the contention police station early in the morning of December 5th,

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:35.020
along with Drew and their new partner in crime, Rosemary, an actual member of the Glass crime family.

01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:40.260
In the station, an FBI agent named Trent Chad was sorting through contention's paperwork.

01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:45.100
Clark shot him with a dart, and agent Trent Chad became very impressionable.

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:49.380
With agent Trent Chad's newfound pliability, the officers worked out ways in order to convince

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:53.700
the public as well as the feds that the local authorities have everything under control

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:54.700
in contention.

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:58.900
The officers found their cells holding Dr. Marie Jacobs and her cat man to be empty.

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:02.900
Upon checking the security footage, they confirmed the black ooze slammed the two jailbirds into

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:05.820
the ground of their cells before disappearing entirely.

01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:09.200
Keith blurted out that the camera will be ready to use at 1 p.m.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:13.360
They checked the evidence room and saw a single green light beaming from the old glass tube

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.660
covered radio.

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:19.600
The officers grab the strange gun and camera and head off to the city with Doug, who is

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.880
in the body of agent Trent Chad.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.880
Rosemary is driving separately.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:27.100
There is a severe lack of traffic and human life in contention.

01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:31.860
The town is loud, though, with plenty of animals filling up the ponds and creeks.

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:35.880
The officers stock up on weapons and throw on body armor at Clark Bishop's house.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.220
Keith brings his very small, very powerful gun.

01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:42.480
On the way, they call Harry Klinker and basically tell him everything that's been happening.

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.320
Harry says Gary didn't come home last night.

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:47.120
Pettymore asks if he's been acting weirder than normal.

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:51.020
Harry says not really, but that he's been meeting with his group more often than usual.

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:54.920
Harry clarifies that it's a group of spiritualists and metaphysics thinkers, including Gary,

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:58.040
Dr. Marie Jacobs, and Mildred Mitchell.

01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:03.600
They call Gary daily, and Gary says he's hanging out with Mildred Mitchell.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:10.880
It would have been way better if they were Harry and Gary Derry.

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:14.660
They call Gary daily, and Gary says he's hanging out with Mildred Mitchell at her house, says

01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:16.920
that she's having a bit of a breakdown.

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.920
Gary describes the group as a...

01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.800
Sorry.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:26.720
Vape break, bro.

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:30.280
They call Gary daily, and Gary says he's hanging out with Mildred Mitchell at her house, says

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:32.040
that she's having a bit of a breakdown.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:34.640
Gary describes the group as a sorcerer's guild.

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:36.880
Gary says it's been years since they'd sorcered anything.

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:37.880
Harry Potter fanfic.

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:38.880
Jesus.

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:39.880
Dude, keep coughing, you'll get higher, bro.

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:40.880
You don't cough those crystals up.

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:41.880
I'm sorry.

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:50.000
You don't have your pen in here, do you?

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.620
He also mentions Carrie Pages, who got the protesters all riled up.

01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:56.440
She might have had something going on, and she had a lot of power.

01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:00.360
Clarke worries that this is all his fault, since he couldn't find her dog.

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:03.800
Gary mentions that Mildred keeps staring at a picture that she thinks somehow changed.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:07.800
It's a picture of the founders of the town, and she is dead certain that Silas Cole looks

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:09.440
different than he did before.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.560
Gary thinks he looks the exact same.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:16.260
Mildred keeps saying he's not as attractive as he used to be, and now he's dumber looking?

01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:20.720
She also says that in a reflection and a piece of glass in the picture is Tildy B. Mitchell.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:24.680
Pettymore asks if Gary would describe his grandfather as a wizard.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.560
Gary says definitely.

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:30.720
Gary explains further that Gary was always afraid to let them know, as he thought it

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.240
might have some sort of reaction.

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:35.540
Gary's grandfather gave him a book, and it had three pages left in it, and he was to

01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:47.840
read those pages after tearing them out of the book and then spill blood upon your heads.

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:51.280
When Gary did that, the words danced like magic on the page and came off like sparks.

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.360
It was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:57.000
It surrounded you guys in this light, and he did it because the three of them are the

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.600
key to everything.

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:01.680
Gary only knows that he'd done his part, and the rest was up to them.

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:05.380
Gary's grandfather didn't tell him exactly what happened, but that, quote, fortune would

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:07.040
be on your side.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:11.800
As the phone call comes to a close, Gary mentions that Mildred hates you guys, and you should

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:13.600
probably avoid her.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:18.520
They get to the city, and Rosemary leads them into a parking garage below a massive skyscraper.

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:22.460
There's an elevator door, and John Lee Pettymore, Keith Vigna, and Clark Bishop get into the

01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:23.460
elevator.

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:28.580
The wall on the other side of the black onyx walled elevator opens into a dark room.

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:31.580
The boys walk in, and the door behind them shuts.

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:32.900
Nice.

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:36.100
Hell yeah.

01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:41.300
There, they meet Marvin Glass.

01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:43.900
How many of you can make yourself burp?

01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:44.900
Nobody.

01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:45.900
Everyone's shaking their head now.

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.900
Oh my god, that's disgusting.

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:48.900
Stop.

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:49.900
There.

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:50.900
Stop it.

01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:53.460
Stop it.

01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:57.140
I don't like that.

01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:58.140
You love it.

01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.140
This is good content.

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:01.220
If you guys don't subscribe to the Patreon, then-

01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:03.940
That will continue.

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:06.840
There they meet Marvin Glass, someone with a massive frame.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:11.700
It is completely gaunt, no muscle or fat, skin stretched across long bones.

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:16.420
They're in a fitted black tuxedo, and the spotlight shows off a bright red bowtie and

01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:20.140
only reaches to illuminate the lower half of that person's face.

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:22.620
The skin on the chin is almost translucent with no hair.

01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:25.180
It has two thin, bright red lips.

01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:31.140
Not even quite lips at all, just red lipstick encircling a round hole above the sharp chin.

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:32.140
And he says-

01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:40.180
I'm so sorry, but real quick, in an episode of 30 Rock, Jonathan says to Liz, your mouth

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:43.660
looks like somebody kicked a hole in a bag of flour.

01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:46.500
God, that's incredible.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:47.940
All right.

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:48.940
Anyway.

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:56.460
Basically accuses John Lee Pettymore of buying lost cocaine off of Ferguson beans.

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:57.460
Never.

01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:58.460
Yeah.

01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:05.340
And there is some confusion over Rosemary's obsession with getting the gun.

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:09.740
Marvin Glass also says that it's good to see Keith, you know, everyone's favorite fuck

01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:12.460
up that he hired to murder his own brother.

01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:14.500
And Keith denies, but-

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:16.620
I deny both of those things.

01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:17.620
Yeah.

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:20.420
He casts and fills the room and all the officers fall unconscious.

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:26.700
I trust my fellow officers, this is stupid, as I hope they trust me.

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:30.600
You guys woke up in metal cages hanging from the ceiling and outlined the smokey, dimly

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.600
lit room.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:36.820
There are three other cages next to yours, each inhabited by a person stripped down to

01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:37.820
their underwear.

01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:38.820
Okay.

01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:40.420
I wrote way too much for this.

01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:41.420
Yeah.

01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:42.420
This one can be-

01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:43.420
It's going back to how the first one was.

01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:44.420
Yeah, it is.

01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:49.900
I've had a theory about why Rosemary was so into that gun for so long now.

01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:53.620
We can talk about it off mic after this.

01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:56.300
Don't talk at- don't talk off mic.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:59.460
I'm just- I'm just talking to you.

01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:04.540
Fifteen feet below is a crowd of 20 or so fancily clad individuals, each parking in-

01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:05.540
This is too much.

01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:06.540
It's way too much.

01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:07.540
I was about to say-

01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:09.020
That's how you described it to us in the episode.

01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:11.180
All the other stuff was very concise.

01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:13.300
This is also going to be the one that they just listened to.

01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:14.300
Oh yeah.

01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:16.300
And then you guys got it from there.

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:17.300
What?

01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:18.300
Okay.

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:19.300
That was a-

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:20.300
Dude better than that.

01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.300
Zach, that was good.

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:22.300
Do you want to record it?

01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:23.300
Yeah.

01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:24.300
I think on this-

01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:29.700
I think that was a really- that was a really solid run through.

01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:30.700
Yeah.

01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:31.700
Let's lay one down.

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:36.260
And then the episode last week happened and you guys are caught up to what's happening

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:38.500
right now.

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:44.140
So thanks for joining us for this Q&A and recap episode of Pretending to be People.

01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:49.960
We'll be back next Monday with your regularly scheduled programming that Wolf the Dog just

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:53.300
loves giving to you every week.

01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:58.700
And I will say we did have one other question that asked if we've played any interesting

01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:02.540
systems other than Delta Green and Pulp Cthulhu.

01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:05.380
And we have plenty of other questions to answer too.

01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:11.540
And we're going to get to all those on our first Patreon only episode that will come

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:12.920
out next month.

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.140
So look forward to that.

01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:20.820
If you want the bonus content, we gotta get the bonus.

01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:28.820
Yeah if you want the tent, give us the poles baby.

01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:29.820
Exactly.

01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:30.820
Yep.

01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:45.220
Wow, thank you so much to Pretending to be People for that sweet, sweet content.

01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:53.380

We've been having some difficulties with the switchboard down here, so I'm going to have

01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:44.460
to premiere a brand new song for y'all this week, here with a certified banger so hot

01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:50.300
that when it slaps it sears it's kudzu with no backbone.

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:39.820
Thanks for watching, see you in the next one.
