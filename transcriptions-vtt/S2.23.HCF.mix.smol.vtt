00:00.000 --> 00:05.320
Hello, all, and welcome to the best radio show in town.

00:05.320 --> 00:11.800
It's 694.2 PTBP, and I'm your host, Wolf the Dog.

00:11.800 --> 00:16.280
I'm here to say things, and you are here to listen.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.840
A perfect relationship.

00:18.840 --> 00:21.680
Sometimes, you're here to say things,

00:21.680 --> 00:23.640
and I'm here to listen.

00:23.640 --> 00:28.160
This episode's Howlin' with Wolf is from Cupcake Sinclair

00:28.200 --> 00:31.960
in Las Vegas, Nevada, who tweeted about the show

00:31.960 --> 00:36.520
and tagged at PretendingPod, an easy and nice thing

00:36.520 --> 00:43.200
you can also do to spread the love and joy of 694.2 PTBP

00:43.200 --> 00:45.920
with your online friendos.

00:45.920 --> 00:51.920
Cupcake Sinclair writes, PTBP equals amazing.

00:51.920 --> 00:54.400
I'm hooked, and I love the reminder

00:54.400 --> 00:56.960
that sex work is real work.

00:57.040 --> 01:00.520
There is discrimination not only from society,

01:00.520 --> 01:03.720
but credit cards dictating what can appear.

01:03.720 --> 01:09.040
For example, TV can film sleeping, hypnosis, et cetera,

01:09.040 --> 01:10.880
but we cannot.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.600
I ask listeners to please consider

01:13.600 --> 01:17.200
how hypocritical laws passed against sex workers

01:17.200 --> 01:21.320
are a canary in the coal mine for wider changes that will

01:21.320 --> 01:24.600
affect us all down the road, especially

01:24.640 --> 01:27.720
in terms of what consenting adults do.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.400
And that's just porn.

01:29.400 --> 01:33.200
You know a sex worker whether you realize or not.

01:33.200 --> 01:37.040
Thank you guys for your hard work, the hilarity you bring,

01:37.040 --> 01:40.040
and the consideration of my announcement.

01:40.040 --> 01:44.680
XOXO, submissive Cupcake Sinclair.

01:44.680 --> 01:47.240
Well, damn, Cupcake Sinclair.

01:47.240 --> 01:50.440
Thanks for all the shout outs and praise.

01:50.440 --> 01:54.520
Let's make sure we all support sex workers' rights.

01:54.520 --> 01:57.440
If you wanna write up something for your little Wolfie

01:57.440 --> 02:00.800
to how, tag at pretending pod on Twitter,

02:00.800 --> 02:03.840
tag at pretending pod on instant gram,

02:03.840 --> 02:07.480
and tag pretending to be people on Facebook.

02:07.480 --> 02:10.920
Or write up a five star review on the podcast app

02:10.920 --> 02:12.280
of your choice.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.280
If you give ol' Wolfie a shout out,

02:15.280 --> 02:18.040
I might read that dang review right here

02:18.040 --> 02:20.520
in the wettest broadcasting studio

02:20.520 --> 02:23.000
this side of the Mississippi.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.440
And this side, it means under.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.320
Do you wanna check out our shit

02:28.320 --> 02:31.080
without having to type a single letter?

02:31.080 --> 02:33.560
All of our links are where?

02:33.560 --> 02:35.600
Say it with me, children.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.960
All of our links are where?

02:37.960 --> 02:40.160
In the show notes.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.240
Seriously, go look at the show notes.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.400
It's wild stuff in there.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.320
And it takes me about four hours to type them up

02:48.320 --> 02:51.040
with these big ol' nasty paws.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.160
Please acknowledge my hard work

02:53.160 --> 02:56.160
and excellent use of language.

02:56.160 --> 02:59.480
Now dial up for some vile fluff.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.800
It's time for the news.

03:01.800 --> 03:05.720
Last time, we met Shelly St. Blythe,

03:05.720 --> 03:09.120
a crystal doctor with a penchant for puppetry

03:09.120 --> 03:13.320
who witnessed something wildly unnatural back in the day.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.600
He was at a dig site with the charming and capable

03:16.600 --> 03:21.320
Dr. Brock Hargrave, as well as Jimmy Corrigan,

03:21.320 --> 03:26.320
a badass merc with a soft spot for his wife and children.

03:26.360 --> 03:30.120
A woman with myriad names, a shrinking frame,

03:30.120 --> 03:32.440
and the voice of Jennifer Jason Leigh

03:32.440 --> 03:35.360
continued building her personal strike team

03:35.360 --> 03:40.360
with the owner of Boeri Security, Vincent T. Boeri,

03:41.240 --> 03:43.320
who has an eye for fashion

03:43.400 --> 03:46.600
and an even better eye for new employees.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.880
And for this particular mission,

03:48.880 --> 03:53.360
she rounded out the squad with a vagabond called Meat Hook.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.480
They received their assignment

03:55.480 --> 03:57.680
in this emaciated woman's house

03:57.680 --> 04:01.160
that reeked of cat piss, sans the cats.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.520
The briefing was as follows.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.760
Dr. Brock Hargrave and one of his coworkers

04:06.760 --> 04:09.800
at Holy Cow Farms have gone missing.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.200
Dr. Hargrave headed out after work

04:12.240 --> 04:14.280
and just didn't come back,

04:14.280 --> 04:17.800
but his missing coworker seemingly never left

04:17.800 --> 04:21.280
the office building of Holy Cow Farms,

04:21.280 --> 04:25.720
taking us now to the death two-car convoy

04:25.720 --> 04:30.720
of Jimmy Corrigan's Jeep and a, Jesus, a stretch Escalade?

04:31.720 --> 04:34.280
Well, this team may be fucked,

04:34.280 --> 04:37.120
but at least we have Hudson Freeman

04:37.120 --> 04:39.920
with Muscles R. Spreems.

04:39.960 --> 04:40.800
Let's go.

04:40.800 --> 04:41.640
Let's go.

05:09.920 --> 05:14.920
What's up, everybody?

05:14.920 --> 05:17.500
I was thinking the same thing.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.480
I am now mechanization.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.960
All my muscles work like screams.

05:37.480 --> 05:38.400
What's up, everybody?

05:38.400 --> 05:41.240
Welcome to episode two of this short story here

05:41.240 --> 05:42.840
on pretending to be people.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.000
It's Holy Cow Farms time.

05:44.040 --> 05:44.880
Holy Cow Farms.

05:44.880 --> 05:45.720
Holy cow.

05:45.720 --> 05:46.560
You know, we looked that up

05:46.560 --> 05:49.960
and Zach, there's only two businesses in the country

05:49.960 --> 05:51.440
that are currently named that.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.560
So pretty good pun.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.400
Pretty good.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.320
And one of them is close enough

05:55.320 --> 05:57.240
where we can go take a picture with the sign.

05:57.240 --> 05:58.080
Yeah.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.080
Or we can go break into their facilities.

06:00.080 --> 06:00.920
We should do that.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.400
We should break into the Holy Cow Farms

06:03.400 --> 06:05.840
that's in Arkansas just as a tribute to this episode.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.520
We should role play inside.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.080
And cause we found out we're all cousins.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.520
We are all cousins.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.720
Us, Paul Rudd, who else?

06:12.720 --> 06:13.640
The Royals.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.440
Jon Hamm.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.280
That's right.

06:16.280 --> 06:17.400
Lord.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.480
Mark Twain.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.240
Ellie Kemper.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.080
Ellie Kemper.

06:21.080 --> 06:21.920
John Goodman.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.320
Oh, Disney.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.120
Jenna Fisher.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.480
Good pull, yes.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.480
Janelle Monae, but she won't claim it.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.320
Ah, damn.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.440
She's from KC though.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.720
Did you say John Goodman?

06:31.720 --> 06:32.760
No, I said John Goodman.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.400
John Goodman.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.240
Yeah.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.080
Oh yeah, Brad Pitt.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.720
Brad Pitt, he's from our town.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.200
Our friend, Brad.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.480
I found out something terrible about Brad Pitt.

06:42.480 --> 06:43.320
What?

06:43.840 --> 06:45.000
He was born in Oklahoma, not Missouri.

06:45.000 --> 06:45.840
What?

06:45.840 --> 06:47.160
Even though he grew up here

06:47.160 --> 06:48.920
and spent his formative years in Springfield.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.520
You really scared me for a minute there.

06:51.520 --> 06:55.720
I really thought you were going to say something

06:55.720 --> 06:58.720
to harm the reputation of our Lord and Savior, Brad Pitt.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.480
Hey, hey, hold on.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.000
This is the Jesus podcast.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.640
Okay, any Jesus lover can admit

07:05.640 --> 07:09.600
that Brad Pitt is as close as we got on this planet.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.400
I want him opening the gates of heaven.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.440
You know what I mean?

07:13.760 --> 07:17.720
I recently watched him murder so many people on a train.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.640
But did he feel bad about it?

07:21.640 --> 07:23.440
He kind of did, honest.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.080
Did any of you see that?

07:25.080 --> 07:25.920
I did see it.

07:25.920 --> 07:26.760
I still haven't seen it.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.840
Bullet train, so fucking good.

07:28.840 --> 07:29.680
Did you see it Becca?

07:29.680 --> 07:31.280
Not yet, no.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.120
You should.

07:32.120 --> 07:32.960
It's a fun one.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.080
I heard Luke and Joe liked it.

07:34.080 --> 07:38.160
I heard it was more ensemble than Brad Pitt.

07:38.160 --> 07:41.480
Yeah, he was the string that ran through the whole movie,

07:41.480 --> 07:42.440
but it was great.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.560
It was like a live action anime starring Brad Pitt.

07:46.760 --> 07:47.600
That's all I need.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.440
That's a great pitch.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.280
Becca, I'm curious to hear a little bit more

07:51.280 --> 07:54.080
about your role-playing history.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.920
I'm sure you've shared this many, many times before,

07:56.920 --> 07:59.800
but what brought you to this lovely hobby

07:59.800 --> 08:00.640
that we all share?

08:00.640 --> 08:02.480
The money, baby.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.520
Fuck yeah, bro.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.280
Pray the bills.

08:06.280 --> 08:11.280
No, hey, I was just a bystander when crit role started.

08:11.400 --> 08:15.440
Having snacks in the kitchen with them at Geek and Sundry,

08:15.440 --> 08:18.280
and we played all kinds of other role-playing games there.

08:18.280 --> 08:23.280
And at first, so competitive board gaming is my jam.

08:23.880 --> 08:24.720
I love it.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.400
Love me some magic, love me any competitive board game.

08:28.400 --> 08:32.400
But once I understood intellectually

08:32.400 --> 08:34.120
that you don't need to win,

08:34.120 --> 08:37.400
in fact, it's way more fun to lose terribly,

08:37.400 --> 08:40.160
that's when role-playing really clicked for me.

08:40.160 --> 08:42.280
And I also have an acting background

08:42.280 --> 08:45.000
from the University of Missouri, Kansas City.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.360
I've driven by there.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.400
So, you know, I just get to act,

08:52.400 --> 08:55.360
but with only my voice and that's real fun.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.200
Hell yeah.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.200
Do you act with your whole body anyway

08:58.200 --> 08:59.480
while you're doing voice acting?

08:59.480 --> 09:02.980
Not today, because I kept my camera off.

09:04.560 --> 09:08.040
But I mean, you've seen us waving our arms around wildly.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.480
Are you doing that like just for no one?

09:10.480 --> 09:14.200
Fun fact, when I do like a commercial voiceover,

09:14.200 --> 09:16.680
I do wiggle my arms in the air.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.200
Like they're little serpents

09:18.200 --> 09:21.760
that are helping me to explain the product.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.080
It's your favorite product you've sold with your voice?

09:25.080 --> 09:26.840
Magic the Gathering.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.480
Hell yeah.

09:29.480 --> 09:30.320
Yeah, that's sick.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.160
And it's a good tie-in for Delta Green,

09:32.160 --> 09:33.600
because one of the artists

09:33.600 --> 09:35.800
on the original Magic the Gathering run

09:35.800 --> 09:37.940
was one of the creators of this game

09:38.700 --> 09:39.700
that we're playing this evening, Delta Green.

09:39.700 --> 09:42.380
Oh shit, I hope it's not one that was canceled.

09:43.420 --> 09:44.260
I hope not.

09:45.260 --> 09:46.100
Me too.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.180
You know those OG artists,

09:47.180 --> 09:50.900
there's some fucked up shit in some of that card stuff.

09:54.180 --> 09:56.700
I'll Google Dennis Stettwiller canceled later

09:56.700 --> 09:57.860
and we'll find out.

09:59.380 --> 10:00.940
That's a leading question.

10:01.940 --> 10:05.940
Does Meat Hook have a collection of banned Magic cards?

10:05.940 --> 10:08.940
Meat Hook made her own banned Magic cards.

10:11.940 --> 10:15.940
And she's remembering going through the cards in her mind

10:15.940 --> 10:18.740
as you're driving, sitting in this car,

10:18.740 --> 10:21.460
because it feels like Magic being inside a vehicle

10:21.460 --> 10:24.220
for the third time in your life, Meat Hook.

10:24.220 --> 10:28.220
And we see the holy cow of magic cards

10:28.220 --> 10:33.220
and we see the holy cow farms office building,

10:33.380 --> 10:37.340
except for holy cow farm seems to share this office building

10:37.340 --> 10:41.440
with a few other companies listed on the sign out front.

10:41.440 --> 10:45.860
It is a very boxy, nondescript office building

10:45.860 --> 10:48.260
with a large parking lot

10:48.260 --> 10:51.420
where you can park wherever you would like.

10:51.420 --> 10:53.140
Today is a Tuesday.

10:53.140 --> 10:57.560
It is 8.57 PM, almost nine o'clock.

10:57.560 --> 10:58.880
The parking lot is dark.

10:58.880 --> 11:03.020
There are orange lights, lighting up specific segments.

11:03.020 --> 11:06.160
And there is a van parked up near the door

11:06.160 --> 11:09.800
that says trolleys cleaning service.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.120
And it's the van has like a paint job,

11:12.120 --> 11:13.680
like it's a trolley car.

11:13.680 --> 11:14.680
Goomba.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.880
I've used those guys a hell of a lot.

11:17.880 --> 11:18.920
They keep the mouth shut.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.600
Wait, you say that like they're that kind of cleaner?

11:21.600 --> 11:22.880
They do all sorts.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.320
Well, they do my townhouse.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.680
I'm sure they do a fricking fantastic job.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.120
Perhaps they'll have a card.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.960
You got a whole townhouse?

11:31.960 --> 11:33.160
Oh, of course, yes.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.360
Do you need someone to live in the basement or something?

11:36.360 --> 11:40.460
Do you need?

11:40.460 --> 11:41.960
It does get lonely there at times.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.320
It would be fun to have a roommates of sorts, yes, sure.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.120
Yeah, like a little basement creep.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.480
Okay, well, maybe we could talk about me

11:50.480 --> 11:51.600
being your basement creep.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.440
Sure, exchange details.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.480
I would love to have a basement creep, yes.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.480
Okay, well, I live in the hold.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.720
That's all the details I can really tell you.

12:04.200 --> 12:08.760
The hold, is that ever on the third street or?

12:08.760 --> 12:10.360
It's like way far outside of town.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.920
There was a street sign once,

12:11.920 --> 12:15.140
but somebody ripped it down and nobody ever fixed it.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.000
Well, I'll give you my address and one day you'll be there

12:21.000 --> 12:23.320
and I'll say, oh, there's the basement creep.

12:24.160 --> 12:24.980
That's how I know you found the place.

12:24.980 --> 12:27.440
This plan works out really well for me.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.200
To be honest, I think this works out for the doc too.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.900
You know, it could really use some companies.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.240
He's going a little bit batty.

12:34.240 --> 12:37.000
Oh, well, you know, we're all going a little batty.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.360
I mean, people tell me I'm batty all the time

12:39.360 --> 12:43.040
just because I stand on street corners handing out leaflets.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.040
Leaflets?

12:44.040 --> 12:45.080
Yeah, you want a leaflet?

12:45.080 --> 12:45.920
Here.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.160
If you've got one, of course, yes.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.640
Let me read your literature.

12:48.640 --> 12:49.460
Yeah.

12:49.460 --> 12:51.280
And what's it about, this one?

12:51.280 --> 12:52.680
That one?

12:52.680 --> 12:57.680
That one's about how we need to be teaching kids

12:59.020 --> 13:01.960
about the underground digging

13:01.960 --> 13:04.640
because we're all gonna have to be mole people someday.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.560
Oh my, you're a basement creep after my own heart.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.480
Yes, get the children digging early on.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.280
They might find things in the ground

13:11.280 --> 13:14.000
and that ties directly into my profession.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.580
We need more kids digging in the ground.

13:16.580 --> 13:18.560
Yeah, I'd like to see one of those pamphlets too.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.760
Oh right, you're like a gym guy, right?

13:20.760 --> 13:24.280
I am an anthropologist, archeologist, historian.

13:24.280 --> 13:25.120
Oh.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.200
But yes, I guess you could call me a gym guy, sure.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.380
We've got some uncut gyms, you know,

13:29.380 --> 13:31.360
that you find there sometimes.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.580
But that's not the real purpose.

13:32.580 --> 13:35.340
The purpose is if we don't teach our kids

13:35.340 --> 13:38.420
to be mole people now, they're gonna be really not used

13:38.420 --> 13:40.440
to living without sunlight.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.920
You know, I kind of thought you might be a little kooky,

13:42.920 --> 13:45.080
but I am 100% in agreement with you

13:45.080 --> 13:46.280
on the mole people issue.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.440
Well, we could get started with your two kids.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.000
Do you wanna put them underground?

13:50.080 --> 13:52.240
I desperately want my kids underground.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.120
Yeah, you could use this pamphlet.

13:54.120 --> 13:57.080
I'm gonna teach those little fuckers to dig.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.920
Enough about this underground shit.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.120
I've got my eyes up to the skies.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.360
They call me the Rock Man, if you didn't know that.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.480
The Rock Man?

14:04.480 --> 14:05.360
The Rocket Man.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.200
Oh.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.740
Rocket Man.

14:07.740 --> 14:11.000
Yeah, I think that's someone else.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
No, in this universe, there is no piano playing musicians

14:16.000 --> 14:20.360
at all, except Billy Joel.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.080
Anyway.

14:25.080 --> 14:28.400
The only piano playing musician in this universe.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.160
Vincente only listens to Billy Joel.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.600
Bach never existed.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.680
It can't be, right?

14:35.680 --> 14:38.320
There must've been a piano player at some point.

14:38.320 --> 14:43.320
Hey, Becca, can you roll a 50-50 up and down roll for me?

14:43.560 --> 14:44.400
If he knows what's good for him.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.520
So if you roll under 50, it'll be a luck success.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.680
If you roll 50 or over, it'll be a luck failure.

14:50.680 --> 14:52.720
Wolfgang Amadeus who?

14:57.080 --> 14:59.240
Those words mean literally nothing to me.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.520
How'd you roll, Becca?

15:02.520 --> 15:05.600
Oh, sorry, I thought someone else was rolling.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.440
Oh, no, sorry.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.680
47.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.520
That is, hell yeah, that is a success.

15:13.560 --> 15:16.720
And so one of the cleaners comes down

15:16.720 --> 15:20.920
and you see that they open up the front door

15:20.920 --> 15:23.400
and walk over to the van

15:23.400 --> 15:26.240
and they go into the back of the van.

15:26.240 --> 15:29.120
If you continue watching, they pop out of the van

15:29.120 --> 15:30.920
and they're smoking a cigarette

15:30.920 --> 15:34.280
and they get on their phone and start chatting with someone.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.740
I slip out the limousine Escalade

15:37.740 --> 15:40.800
and I creep up behind them

15:40.800 --> 15:44.720
and I wanna attack by jumping

15:44.720 --> 15:49.720
from flat footed on the ground to onto their shoulders

15:49.720 --> 15:52.240
and put them in a headlock, because I'm pretty small.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.760
Okay, would you rather roll athletics

15:54.760 --> 15:56.520
or unarmed combat for this?

15:56.520 --> 15:58.800
I would like to roll the same thing, doesn't matter.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.160
A classic would you rather?

16:02.880 --> 16:05.200
Yeah, I wish there was hard success in this game

16:05.200 --> 16:07.240
because I rolled a 12 under 50.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.160
Nice. Nice.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.320
They failed on their check,

16:10.760 --> 16:13.160
so you can easily jump.

16:14.720 --> 16:18.880
Meat Hook, they start sniffing the air as you approach,

16:20.480 --> 16:23.160
but don't look back in time

16:23.160 --> 16:27.160
and suddenly there's a tiny little dirty person

16:27.160 --> 16:31.120
on this cleaner's back and they're on their phone.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.280
Cleaner's worst enemy.

16:32.280 --> 16:37.280
I squeeze their throat with my little arm

16:48.120 --> 16:50.720
until they can't yell anymore.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.960
Okay, go ahead and roll damage.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.960
So that'll.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.240
I squeeze with my little arm.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.080
Someone who can't yell.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.960
Go ahead and.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.200
Wait, my damage is one D4?

17:08.200 --> 17:09.160
Yeah, one D4 minus one,

17:09.160 --> 17:11.480
and I'll give you an additional D4

17:11.480 --> 17:13.840
because you snuck up on them.

17:13.840 --> 17:15.560
I rolled a four on the first one

17:15.560 --> 17:17.280
and a four on the second one.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.240
This die is busted.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.960
That's, was it minus one for each die?

17:21.960 --> 17:25.000
It is, so with six hit points,

17:25.000 --> 17:29.680
that actually takes down half of their hit points

17:29.720 --> 17:31.360
in one fell swoop,

17:31.360 --> 17:34.760
and they failed their constitution check to stay conscious,

17:34.760 --> 17:37.760
which works out quite well for your plans.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.280
As this person hits the ground

17:40.280 --> 17:44.040
and their cell phone with it smashes onto the ground

17:44.040 --> 17:46.360
and you just hear a voice coming out.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.240
That's like, Dorothy, Dorothy, Dorothy.

17:50.480 --> 17:51.440
It was a woman?

17:51.440 --> 17:53.520
Yeah, it was a woman that you jumped on.

17:54.120 --> 17:59.120
I feel like I've, you know, our sisterhood.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.560
I betrayed her.

18:03.440 --> 18:04.920
Well, too late.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.560
Yeah, but you won one for the class struggle.

18:10.880 --> 18:11.720
She's a-

18:11.720 --> 18:12.560
Those cleaners.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.880
I know, but urchins. City cleaners.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.240
Urchins are pitted against the working class.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.920
Yeah, but she's got a leg up on me.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.240
I see what you're saying.

18:21.240 --> 18:25.200
Vincente walks over and does she have like a key ring?

18:25.200 --> 18:26.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:26.040 --> 18:29.040
You see that there is a key ring

18:29.040 --> 18:31.960
with basically some normal keys,

18:31.960 --> 18:34.800
as well as some like scan cards

18:34.800 --> 18:36.960
that are attached to this ring.

18:36.960 --> 18:41.280
And you see this phone also on the ground that-

18:41.280 --> 18:44.400
Dorothy, Dorothy, should I, what do I do?

18:44.400 --> 18:48.280
I look at Vincenzo, whatever your name is.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.840
Close enough.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.400
Should I pretend to be her?

18:52.400 --> 18:53.240
Hold on.

18:54.720 --> 18:55.560
Yes.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.720
He rolled to say that.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.560
You had to roll to see

18:59.560 --> 19:01.520
if she should do the name of the podcast.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.080
It could pretend to be people.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.840
No, you can't do that.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.040
Barrel down the camera.

19:11.040 --> 19:16.040
Hi, it's sorry, I think I need a rest.

19:19.840 --> 19:24.840
I was going to say it's me, Dorothy, but I made that one in.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.560
Convince her.

19:29.560 --> 19:32.160
Oh my God, Becca, please roll disguise.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.000
Great.

19:33.000 --> 19:33.840
Yeah, the skill you didn't take.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.200
I added nothing to this skill.

19:37.560 --> 19:41.920
Okay, so that's a 56 and I have a 10%.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.200
That's a big failure.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.040
Oddly enough.

19:44.040 --> 19:46.200
The voice on the other end of the phone is like,

19:47.160 --> 19:50.360
yeah, okay, all right.

19:50.360 --> 19:54.160
Well, I have to take a nap in my van now.

19:55.640 --> 19:59.680
Okay, Dorothy, sleep well.

19:59.680 --> 20:03.160
Wait, can you remind me what we were just talking about?

20:03.160 --> 20:04.920
And that's the scariest thing

20:04.920 --> 20:07.800
this person on the other end has ever heard.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.080
A different voice than their friend, Dorothy,

20:11.720 --> 20:14.080
has taken the phone, says that,

20:14.120 --> 20:18.160
and you hear a deadline on the other end of this.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.720
I think I got away with it.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.040
Very good performance there, Meathook.

20:24.040 --> 20:25.360
Thank you, doctor.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.400
You're going to be a really valuable asset

20:27.400 --> 20:30.760
to the family after this, if you survive.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.400
We don't even know why the cleaners were here.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.840
This kid's going to get us all killed.

20:34.840 --> 20:37.880
Things are really turning around for me.

20:37.880 --> 20:40.880
I already get to be somebody's basement troll.

20:41.880 --> 20:45.120
We're friends, a guy with spats on his shoes,

20:45.120 --> 20:47.720
and this guy's, he's going to let me teach his kids

20:47.720 --> 20:49.800
to dig on the ground.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.800
You really ingratiated yourself with this group.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.760
And to think we almost killed you.

20:58.760 --> 20:59.600
What?

21:01.320 --> 21:03.360
He thinks to himself.

21:05.080 --> 21:05.920
He says out loud.

21:05.920 --> 21:06.760
He says out loud.

21:06.760 --> 21:10.120
You've got an interior monologue problem, I think.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.000
It's just coming out.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.080
No one ever tells me no.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.520
Okay, glad we're friends.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.920
He starts swinging the key ring around his finger

21:22.920 --> 21:26.520
and just kind of jaunts into the open door

21:26.520 --> 21:27.840
that Dorothy came out of.

21:27.840 --> 21:30.000
Did we take Moses up on getting

21:30.000 --> 21:32.880
some laminated name tags printed out?

21:32.880 --> 21:34.560
Yeah, what did you want on those?

21:34.560 --> 21:37.520
Mrs. Milk Woman.

21:38.440 --> 21:39.960
Mrs. Milk Woman.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.920
No, I don't know.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.920
What do you think I should write?

21:43.920 --> 21:45.640
Maybe not that, maybe.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.680
Nobody looks at these things too hard.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.600
Just give me a normal name, you know, like Meat Hook.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.440
Milk Hook.

21:58.440 --> 21:59.280
Milk Hook.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.280
Milk Hook is perfect.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.280
Mine just says Milk Hook one way.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.880
They'll never know who it is.

22:04.400 --> 22:08.760
I'd like my badge to say I'm a cleaner named Dorothy.

22:11.280 --> 22:12.720
A well-timed flashback.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.120
Oh, do you read minds?

22:16.120 --> 22:17.880
Are you going with cleaners?

22:17.880 --> 22:22.040
Are you going with some sort of governmental agency?

22:22.040 --> 22:24.720
What kind of cover would you have?

22:24.720 --> 22:25.760
Bug spray?

22:25.760 --> 22:28.720
I think I just want to be a milk tech.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.160
Classic milk tech.

22:30.160 --> 22:31.800
I'm a milk tester.

22:31.800 --> 22:35.440
I always infiltrate dairy offices as a milk tech crew.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.280
That's right.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.360
So classic milk tech group here.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.920
You got your tester and three texts.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.720
Yeah, and like Luke said,

22:47.720 --> 22:51.840
the door is open and unlocked as you go over there.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.120
I think you're the only one over there with the door open

22:54.120 --> 22:55.640
as you call back to the rest of the group.

22:55.640 --> 22:56.960
Hey, door's open.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.480
Jimmy, can you do something about this body

22:59.480 --> 23:01.520
that I incapacitated?

23:02.240 --> 23:04.040
You got to learn how to deal with those mistakes

23:04.040 --> 23:04.880
on your own.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.160
Damn it, okay.

23:06.160 --> 23:08.760
I put my arms under the armpits

23:08.760 --> 23:11.040
and try and drag her into the back of the van.

23:11.040 --> 23:13.360
Drag her into the van, just like that.

23:13.360 --> 23:14.600
You're a natural.

23:14.600 --> 23:15.920
You're a good father.

23:15.920 --> 23:16.760
Thank you.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.800
You teach, you don't do for it.

23:18.800 --> 23:22.200
You know, you got to teach me to fish.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.200
Hers says milk, hers says milk tech,

23:26.200 --> 23:28.120
your name tag says bean dad.

23:29.640 --> 23:30.720
Bean dad?

23:30.760 --> 23:33.680
I just learned what this was today.

23:35.040 --> 23:35.880
Oh no.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.280
Bean dad's a wild internet.

23:39.280 --> 23:41.120
Oh, I remember bean dad.

23:41.120 --> 23:41.960
It's pretty sad.

23:41.960 --> 23:45.600
When she says, teach me to fish, fish face pops his head off.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.240
Now you fish face.

23:50.240 --> 23:51.120
Okay, sorry.

23:52.040 --> 23:53.000
Wait, fish face?

23:53.000 --> 23:53.840
Yeah.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.240
You remember that time we were sitting on that dock?

23:58.280 --> 23:59.120
Yeah.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.760
Looking at the moon.

24:00.760 --> 24:01.600
Nevermind.

24:01.600 --> 24:02.440
Nevermind.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.760
It can never work.

24:03.760 --> 24:04.680
Yeah, you're right.

24:04.680 --> 24:05.520
Okay, bye.

24:06.720 --> 24:09.000
Get back in the front seat next to Goomba.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.120
Hey, get over here, Miwok, okay?

24:14.120 --> 24:15.040
All right, let's do it.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.040
Come on, let's hang out.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.520
Okay, Miwok, all right.

24:17.520 --> 24:20.320
Hey, Goomba, start turning the car around.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.480
It's going to take a while

24:21.480 --> 24:23.880
and we're going to have to get out of here quick.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.200
That's like a 36 point turn.

24:26.200 --> 24:30.200
I would imagine had I ever seen a ridden in cars before.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.640
Wait, hold on, kid.

24:31.640 --> 24:32.960
That's exactly right.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.200
I think you're a natural.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.840
Wait, are you some kind of math nerd?

24:35.840 --> 24:39.160
No, it's just that, okay, it sounds silly,

24:39.160 --> 24:41.280
but the spirits speak to me.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.560
I think they're from another planet,

24:43.560 --> 24:46.360
but it's more like another dimension.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.840
I got a pamphlet about it.

24:47.840 --> 24:48.680
Here.

24:48.680 --> 24:49.920
Let's review this pamphlet.

24:51.360 --> 24:53.240
Well, maybe we should go into this dairy farm

24:53.240 --> 24:55.800
before whoever was on the line to Dorothy

24:56.320 --> 24:57.520
comes looking for her.

24:57.520 --> 24:59.440
No, what do these spirits say?

25:00.400 --> 25:02.520
As Vincenti walks into Holy Cow Farms,

25:02.520 --> 25:05.880
he reads aloud, just sometimes spirits talk to me.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.000
Oh, nice.

25:10.000 --> 25:10.840
Fascinating.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.160
Cool, kid.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.000
You're a little out there,

25:13.000 --> 25:14.600
but I haven't seen anything in these pamphlets

25:14.600 --> 25:16.440
that would disqualify you from a career

25:16.440 --> 25:18.960
in extensive stretch limousineery.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.440
As you guys are looking at the map on the wall

25:24.440 --> 25:26.400
of this office building inside,

25:26.400 --> 25:29.160
it's just got the different names

25:29.160 --> 25:31.240
on which floors they're on.

25:31.240 --> 25:34.920
And you see that Holy Cow Farms is on the eighth floor

25:34.920 --> 25:39.040
of this building, and there are 12 floors total.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.040
If I look at these other businesses

25:41.040 --> 25:43.600
in having known Hargrave and being a colleague,

25:43.600 --> 25:45.480
are there any other businesses that stand out

25:45.480 --> 25:47.480
as maybe something else that he would have been

25:47.480 --> 25:50.200
maybe here to look for or into?

25:50.200 --> 25:51.200
Interesting.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.040
Go ahead and roll.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.320
While I think of something.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.160
Yeah, exactly.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.120
Makes a lot more sense than what I had.

25:58.120 --> 26:01.840
I rolled a 49 on a 50 anthropology is what I rolled.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.200
Okay, yeah, so.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.520
For being aware of the profession.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.520
Not that I'm using an anthropological skill.

26:08.520 --> 26:11.920
With all of your knowledge of the field of anthropology.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.400
Which includes all the articles about Dr. Hargrave

26:14.400 --> 26:16.000
that he's obsessively like,

26:17.280 --> 26:19.520
he knows the man through his study.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.880
I mean, you see there's like a dermatologist

26:21.880 --> 26:25.400
on the first floor, there's a cafe on the second floor,

26:25.400 --> 26:29.000
on the third floor, there's a psychic

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
holding the same floor as a kid's play land.

26:34.520 --> 26:37.760
And on the fourth floor, there's a massage parlor.

26:43.320 --> 26:45.160
On the fifth floor, there's a karaoke place.

26:45.160 --> 26:49.080
There's a bunch of places, none of which stand out to you.

26:49.080 --> 26:52.680
But you're confident that whatever he was looking for

26:52.680 --> 26:56.200
connection wise, it's probably at holy cow farms.

26:56.200 --> 26:59.480
The kids, they're training to be psychic.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.720
Now we know, he was here for the milk.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.560
Which is what the handler had circled

27:03.560 --> 27:05.040
in the name of the scenario.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.720
I bet that's just a red herring.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.120
And on the seventh floor, it says psychic kids.

27:19.320 --> 27:20.280
Psychic children.

27:20.280 --> 27:21.880
Psychic kids in adult play bed.

27:21.880 --> 27:24.360
Play bed.

27:24.360 --> 27:26.840
It just has bigger, it's a ball pit, but with bigger balls.

27:26.840 --> 27:30.920
It's a child's sidekick in a disgusting ball pit.

27:30.920 --> 27:33.720
It's not a bigger pit, it's the balls that are bigger.

27:33.720 --> 27:34.560
Yeah.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.520
Yeah, the other tracks.

27:39.520 --> 27:41.160
One adult fits in at a time.

27:42.680 --> 27:44.440
Does Trolley's cleaning service

27:44.440 --> 27:47.200
have an office in the building?

27:47.200 --> 27:49.680
No, they seem to have been here cleaning.

27:49.680 --> 27:50.640
Good question.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.520
I've done a little detective work.

27:52.520 --> 27:53.960
These cleaners?

27:53.960 --> 27:55.040
Probably cleaning.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.000
Yes, very good.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Very good deduction, I see why we brought you along.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.120
And as you all get into the elevator,

28:02.120 --> 28:03.760
you see the same kind of sign

28:03.760 --> 28:06.360
with all the different listings for the floors

28:06.360 --> 28:08.720
as well as the buttons on elevators

28:08.720 --> 28:10.680
where you click them to make it go up.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.240
There's also the closed door button,

28:12.240 --> 28:13.480
but it doesn't do anything.

28:13.480 --> 28:16.400
Hey look, there's no 13th floor button in this one.

28:17.760 --> 28:21.400
Yeah, you can't put a 13th floor button in an elevator.

28:21.400 --> 28:24.360
No, especially if there's only 12 stories to it.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.160
And he clicks the eighth button.

28:28.160 --> 28:30.160
I have to go pee really bad, I'm sorry.

28:30.160 --> 28:31.000
Hold it.

28:31.000 --> 28:31.840
Okay, sounds good.

28:31.840 --> 28:36.840
So the elevator doors open and you see a dark office.

28:37.160 --> 28:40.400
We're gonna use the layout for the office office.

28:40.400 --> 28:41.240
Tight.

28:41.240 --> 28:44.080
So in front of you, you see-

28:44.080 --> 28:45.520
A UK or American.

28:47.720 --> 28:48.560
Good question.

28:51.880 --> 28:54.560
I don't know the layout of the UK one nearly as well.

28:54.560 --> 28:55.800
Pretty similar.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.640
That makes sense.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.320
Based on the scripts of the first season.

28:59.320 --> 29:04.040
And so you see the round desk ahead of you,

29:04.040 --> 29:05.120
coat rack on the right.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.760
And yeah, the lights are off.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.440
There seems to be no one here.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.640
You fumble around with the keys.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.760
You're looking at that all through the glass door.

29:11.760 --> 29:12.960
Looking around the keys,

29:12.960 --> 29:16.480
you see that one of the key cards is for Holy Cow Farms.

29:16.480 --> 29:20.720
He sticks it in the keyhole and turns the key.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.800
The light turns green, door opens.

29:22.800 --> 29:25.040
On the other side, you hear the van.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.040
Way outside running still.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.360
It's a loud van.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.160
It's a really loud van.

29:30.160 --> 29:33.160
When the windows are open, it's hot, it's July.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.600
They're trying to air it out.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.920
I'm glad the windows open on the eighth floor

29:36.920 --> 29:37.760
of this building.

29:37.760 --> 29:39.560
It would make my job a lot easier

29:39.560 --> 29:41.760
if I came here to do my normal job.

29:41.760 --> 29:44.560
Oh, what sort of line of work are you in?

29:44.560 --> 29:45.720
Window cleaning.

29:47.440 --> 29:50.480
And you find that to be easier with the windows open?

29:51.440 --> 29:54.000
Some strange world window cleaning.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.680
I guess I've never thought about it much.

29:56.680 --> 29:58.000
It must be.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.080
Hold on.

29:59.080 --> 30:00.240
With these windows open,

30:00.240 --> 30:02.280
I wonder what they're trying to air out.

30:02.280 --> 30:05.400
Can I do a check for smell?

30:05.400 --> 30:06.320
Yeah, absolutely.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.920
Go ahead and roll alertness or search.

30:09.880 --> 30:10.720
Let's see.

30:11.840 --> 30:12.760
Search.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.200
Nope, it's a 56.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.240
And I needed a 50.

30:18.240 --> 30:19.520
Damn.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.440
Sniffing the air, meat hook,

30:21.440 --> 30:25.960
you smell something burning or burnt.

30:25.960 --> 30:28.880
And Vincent is smoking a cigarette right next to you.

30:28.880 --> 30:29.720
Okay.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.480
There's a thick smoke next to you.

30:35.320 --> 30:36.160
Obviously share the information.

30:36.160 --> 30:39.280
And you notice that there's a trash can nearby

30:39.280 --> 30:42.280
with a bunch of burnt popcorn that's been tossed into it.

30:42.280 --> 30:47.120
Vincent would like to do a smell with his eyes around.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.640
Yeah, I kind of figured this is a,

30:50.640 --> 30:52.680
there's no one in here that you can see.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.720
So this is going to be kind of an exploration kind of thing.

30:55.720 --> 30:56.840
What are you looking for?

30:56.840 --> 30:57.920
Where are you going?

30:57.920 --> 31:00.080
I'm just kind of wandering through

31:00.080 --> 31:02.680
and just like looking for blood.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.080
What did you roll?

31:06.080 --> 31:08.680
He's just not looking too hard.

31:08.680 --> 31:12.640
Well, you don't find any blood.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.280
Jimmy lets out a huge sigh and he's like,

31:14.280 --> 31:16.920
all right, I'll teach you how to smell.

31:19.320 --> 31:22.800
And he's going to roll an alertness nine.

31:22.800 --> 31:23.640
Yeah, with a nine,

31:23.640 --> 31:26.600
your sniffer smells the exact same cigarette smoke

31:26.600 --> 31:29.520
and burnt popcorn that the others have been smelling.

31:29.520 --> 31:34.520
But your alertness pass shows you to one of the desks nearby

31:35.360 --> 31:39.600
that you see some paperwork strewn about.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.160
And you notice, oh, this is-

31:41.160 --> 31:43.000
It's covered in blood that he missed.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.640
It's hand prints all the way up.

31:47.680 --> 31:50.480
Big bloody arrows on the floor pointing to the desk.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.320
This is help.

31:54.760 --> 31:58.720
No, you see Dr. Brock Hargrave's desk

31:58.720 --> 32:00.880
here at Holy Cow Farms.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.520
You see a picture of him.

32:02.560 --> 32:05.040
You see lots of papers all over his desk

32:05.040 --> 32:07.360
that have his name on them.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.800
And there is a computer at his workstation

32:10.800 --> 32:14.960
as well as a large file cabinet.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.480
Yeah, you're at his desk.

32:16.480 --> 32:18.720
You see that there are probably what,

32:18.720 --> 32:22.920
like 14, 16 desks around the office and little pods.

32:22.920 --> 32:25.480
This guy sat in Dwight's desk.

32:27.800 --> 32:28.640
Nice.

32:28.640 --> 32:32.040
Yeah, I pick his phone like of Jell-O, toss it aside.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.880
Doc, I think you better get over here

32:34.880 --> 32:36.320
and look at some of these files.

32:36.320 --> 32:40.080
Yes, I'm very curious what Brock Hargrave was doing

32:40.080 --> 32:41.680
here at Holy Cow Farms.

32:41.680 --> 32:46.180
And you see a picture of him holding up this artifact

32:46.180 --> 32:49.620
on this expedition that you are in the picture,

32:49.620 --> 32:50.880
you were in the expedition,

32:50.880 --> 32:55.160
but the way he's holding out his arm in gleeful triumph

32:55.160 --> 32:58.080
is blocking your face from being seen in the picture.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.960
Look, see, this is me and Brock.

33:02.920 --> 33:04.080
I promise, that's me there.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.460
You can't quite see my face,

33:05.460 --> 33:08.120
but I was once a person who would go

33:08.120 --> 33:09.520
on these expeditions like this.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.360
It's him, Meat Hook, I was there.

33:11.360 --> 33:15.200
Oh yeah, yeah, no, you got the kind of same chunky middle.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.120
Yeah, I see.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.920
Yes, yes, yes, the chunky middle, yes.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.360
Stand aside, let me look,

33:22.360 --> 33:24.280
and I start rummaging through his papers.

33:24.280 --> 33:26.060
Rummaging through his papers, I'm gonna go pee.

33:26.060 --> 33:27.440
I have to.

33:27.440 --> 33:30.880
Yeah, I was just joking earlier when I said don't pee.

33:32.940 --> 33:34.280
I'm very sneakily eating.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.200
Do it less sneaky.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.820
You want a mukbang?

33:45.320 --> 33:47.060
You don't know about mukbangs?

33:47.060 --> 33:47.900
No, I do.

33:47.900 --> 33:48.740
We know.

33:48.740 --> 33:50.900
The whole idea, really, I dislike.

33:53.280 --> 33:54.280
You asked for it.

33:55.740 --> 33:56.580
Crunch.

33:56.580 --> 33:58.100
You can chew as lot as you fucking want.

33:58.100 --> 34:01.340
Boy, that's a whole lot of papers.

34:02.020 --> 34:05.460
It's taking me quite some time to get through these.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.900
Read all his notes while he's gone.

34:07.900 --> 34:09.660
We'll just totally ruin the adventure

34:09.660 --> 34:11.940
and say go exactly where you...

34:13.180 --> 34:16.100
Skip to the last page to see who did it.

34:16.100 --> 34:18.540
Now that's the way to choose your own adventure.

34:19.720 --> 34:20.940
I choose to win.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.140
I'm not gonna let a stupid book beat me.

34:25.140 --> 34:26.460
That's what we call Zach.

34:27.180 --> 34:32.180
Becca, I saw that you played Bleak Prospect

34:32.300 --> 34:33.700
with the Glass Cannon crew,

34:33.700 --> 34:36.260
and it was like a week after we had just got done playing it

34:36.260 --> 34:37.980
with Scott Dorwood, the guy who wrote it.

34:37.980 --> 34:40.700
And it was really fun to see you guys do

34:40.700 --> 34:42.020
a totally different...

34:42.020 --> 34:44.780
Oh man, yeah, that was a Bleak one.

34:44.780 --> 34:46.540
That was so fun.

34:46.540 --> 34:48.080
I can't believe you played with Scott Dorwood.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.380
That's amazing.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.860
It was super cool, yeah.

34:50.860 --> 34:52.180
We've played with him a couple of times now.

34:52.180 --> 34:54.060
He's run us through some of his stuff.

34:54.060 --> 34:55.980
He's like our podcast grandpa.

34:56.860 --> 34:57.900
I played with him once.

34:57.900 --> 34:59.400
It hasn't come out yet though.

35:00.620 --> 35:03.100
Did you guys play some Call of Cthulhu?

35:03.100 --> 35:05.620
On an award-winning podcast.

35:05.620 --> 35:08.780
Oh, an award-winning podcast you say?

35:08.780 --> 35:11.220
They won best podcasts at the Innies.

35:11.220 --> 35:12.060
Nice.

35:12.060 --> 35:12.900
Was it on The Daily?

35:12.900 --> 35:14.100
It was The Daily.

35:14.100 --> 35:17.780
I played Call of Cthulhu.

35:17.780 --> 35:19.620
I'm Michael Barbaro.

35:20.860 --> 35:22.500
This is Call of Cthulhu.

35:22.500 --> 35:24.500
Here's what else you need to roll today.

35:26.740 --> 35:27.580
Love it.

35:28.580 --> 35:30.300
Boy, it's taken you quite a while

35:30.300 --> 35:32.340
to shuffle through all those papers.

35:32.340 --> 35:34.540
There's just a lot here, it's a lot to get through,

35:34.540 --> 35:37.020
but I'm not seeing exactly...

35:37.020 --> 35:38.340
Emma?

35:38.340 --> 35:40.580
Lights start going off.

35:40.580 --> 35:45.580
Red lights illuminate the entirety of this office.

35:46.500 --> 35:50.140
And a small voice says,

35:50.140 --> 35:53.940
Hello, an intruder has been found here.

35:53.940 --> 35:58.260
Please call the security company if this is an alarm.

35:58.260 --> 36:01.100
Hello, an intrusion has been found here.

36:01.100 --> 36:06.100
Please call security if this was a mistake.

36:07.620 --> 36:09.180
Jeremy, I'm going to try this again.

36:09.180 --> 36:12.460
I've never heard a more confused automated message,

36:12.460 --> 36:13.660
but I'm going to give it a try

36:13.660 --> 36:17.140
and I take the phone out of the jello and press like those.

36:17.140 --> 36:21.580
It says call security if it's a break-in.

36:21.580 --> 36:25.180
If we don't call, the security won't come?

36:25.180 --> 36:26.020
You're right.

36:26.020 --> 36:26.860
I think you're right.

36:26.860 --> 36:27.700
That is correct, yes.

36:27.700 --> 36:28.540
That's what they said.

36:28.540 --> 36:31.220
That is what the voice said very explicitly, yes.

36:31.220 --> 36:32.700
Those were great instincts, Meathook.

36:32.700 --> 36:33.700
I hang up the phone.

36:34.940 --> 36:38.100
Okay, wow, we really dodged that bullet.

36:38.100 --> 36:39.900
Phew, that was a close one.

36:41.220 --> 36:43.820
Wow, I'm not used to all these indoor lights.

36:44.740 --> 36:45.580
Pfft.

36:49.740 --> 36:51.380
With the flashing red lights

36:51.380 --> 36:53.660
continuing to illuminate your search,

36:53.660 --> 36:56.500
I need everyone who is searching

36:56.500 --> 36:59.180
to go ahead and roll a search check for me.

36:59.180 --> 37:00.580
We'll see what you find in this place.

37:00.580 --> 37:01.860
Ooh, a crit pass.

37:01.860 --> 37:03.420
It's a 22 on a 60.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.300
Well, that will fucking do it, huh?

37:07.980 --> 37:11.420
Vincenty regular passes as he smiles,

37:11.420 --> 37:12.860
knowing that this building

37:12.860 --> 37:15.140
bought one of his security systems.

37:15.140 --> 37:19.260
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

37:19.260 --> 37:21.340
Meathook fails.

37:21.340 --> 37:24.260
You know, computers, not my thing.

37:25.220 --> 37:28.420
Are you doing the Zoolander thing on one of them?

37:28.420 --> 37:30.620
And the pages are too big.

37:30.620 --> 37:31.900
Eight and a half by 11,

37:31.900 --> 37:35.860
I need a four by six square leaflet.

37:38.060 --> 37:38.900
I love that.

37:38.900 --> 37:40.180
Scott, you might have a future

37:40.220 --> 37:41.380
in the printing industry too,

37:41.380 --> 37:43.100
if limousining doesn't work out.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.660
Well, thank you.

37:45.660 --> 37:48.500
You've learned a lot about leaflets in your time.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.020
Well, you know, I dabble.

37:50.020 --> 37:51.340
I dabble in zines.

37:55.620 --> 37:58.380
How long have you been dabbling in the anarchy scene?

37:59.420 --> 38:01.300
No, zines with a Z.

38:01.300 --> 38:02.140
Oh, zines.

38:02.140 --> 38:04.260
Zines, which is part of the anarchy scene.

38:04.260 --> 38:06.460
Oh yeah, all my life, baby.

38:06.860 --> 38:09.900
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

38:09.900 --> 38:12.660
Okay, so Shelly St. Blythe,

38:12.660 --> 38:13.740
with your critical success,

38:13.740 --> 38:15.100
we're going to come back to you.

38:15.100 --> 38:15.940
Okay.

38:15.940 --> 38:19.300
The success was Vincenti Boeri.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.140
Yes?

38:20.140 --> 38:21.220
Yes.

38:21.220 --> 38:22.700
Thank you.

38:22.700 --> 38:24.460
As you're going through the desk,

38:24.460 --> 38:27.060
you're kind of feeling around

38:27.060 --> 38:28.700
and you feel underneath,

38:28.700 --> 38:32.980
there's this kind of wooden piece that is sticking out.

38:32.980 --> 38:34.020
And when you flick it,

38:34.060 --> 38:38.300
a false bottom comes out from the main drawer of this desk.

38:38.300 --> 38:39.220
When it pops down,

38:39.220 --> 38:42.380
you see it's full of notes about things

38:42.380 --> 38:46.540
that have been brought to Trigate Supply.

38:46.540 --> 38:51.540
You see a map of the city with little dots poking around

38:51.900 --> 38:56.740
in a specific kind of layout at the Zeitgeist,

38:56.740 --> 39:00.180
which is an abandoned space needle here in the city.

39:00.180 --> 39:01.300
That's cool.

39:01.300 --> 39:02.740
Yeah, it is.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.620
Shout out to Dylan B from Deadwood, South Dakota,

39:05.620 --> 39:07.940
for giving us the Zeitgeist.

39:07.940 --> 39:08.780
Nice.

39:08.780 --> 39:09.620
And while we're here,

39:09.620 --> 39:10.860
shout out to Zakharov Salyer,

39:10.860 --> 39:13.700
another $10 up patron for Trigate Supply.

39:13.700 --> 39:14.540
And finally,

39:14.540 --> 39:19.020
you see a handwritten note scrawled on the bottom corner

39:19.020 --> 39:21.420
of one of these pages that says,

39:21.420 --> 39:24.860
Strummer's Crystal, question mark.

39:24.860 --> 39:27.700
Doctor, you know almost as much as this guy,

39:27.700 --> 39:29.820
but definitely not as much about crystals

39:29.820 --> 39:31.820
and stuff found in the earth.

39:31.860 --> 39:33.380
What's this Strummer's thing?

39:34.380 --> 39:36.540
Did you say Strummer's?

39:36.540 --> 39:39.340
You would know that there is a shop in town

39:39.340 --> 39:42.180
called Strummer's Resonating Crystals,

39:42.180 --> 39:44.660
and it is owned by Aaron Strummer.

39:44.660 --> 39:47.060
Shout out to Dale Armont from Arkansas.

39:47.060 --> 39:48.180
Yee-haw.

39:48.180 --> 39:50.300
The land of actual crystal shops.

39:50.300 --> 39:52.780
The land of crystal shops and holy cow farms.

39:52.780 --> 39:53.620
Yeah.

39:53.620 --> 39:54.780
Whoopee.

39:54.780 --> 39:56.620
Whoopee.

39:56.620 --> 39:57.460
Whoopee.

39:57.460 --> 39:59.820
Yes, that's Aaron's establishment.

39:59.820 --> 40:02.380
That's where I do most of my gym shopping.

40:02.380 --> 40:07.380
What could Hargrave want with a gym shop that I frequent?

40:07.820 --> 40:09.460
Is he trying to do me in?

40:09.460 --> 40:11.260
Is he trying to finish me off for good?

40:11.260 --> 40:12.260
Or maybe just prank you.

40:12.260 --> 40:13.780
He really likes to mess around.

40:13.780 --> 40:16.420
I mean, I think you gotta just let this guy stop having...

40:16.420 --> 40:18.580
Obviously we have to finish this mission,

40:18.580 --> 40:19.420
but in general,

40:19.420 --> 40:21.900
this guy needs to have less space in your head.

40:22.900 --> 40:25.300
Shelly needs a minute to clear his head,

40:25.300 --> 40:27.420
and he walks off into the other room

40:27.420 --> 40:30.660
and walks directly into the security room

40:30.660 --> 40:35.660
with some TVs around and different like VHS tapes

40:36.300 --> 40:39.220
lining the wall with different dates on it

40:39.220 --> 40:42.660
and tiny little security TVs that you could play them on.

40:42.660 --> 40:43.620
Nobody here though?

40:43.620 --> 40:44.860
There's nobody here now.

40:44.860 --> 40:46.620
You just walk right into this room.

40:48.300 --> 40:49.140
Looking around,

40:49.140 --> 40:52.140
it just seems to be looking at holy cow farms only,

40:52.140 --> 40:53.460
not the rest of the building.

40:53.460 --> 40:54.300
I kind of turn...

40:54.300 --> 40:56.660
There's only like three cameras in here.

40:56.740 --> 40:59.060
I kind of turn to the rest of the room.

40:59.060 --> 41:00.820
I believe I found the nerve center

41:00.820 --> 41:02.860
for the security operation.

41:02.860 --> 41:05.420
We might be able to see what may have happened that day

41:05.420 --> 41:08.140
that Hargrave left and his coworker disappeared.

41:08.140 --> 41:13.020
Well, if the security system is all my security system,

41:13.020 --> 41:14.380
it's probably not gonna work great,

41:14.380 --> 41:18.420
but we can try.

41:18.420 --> 41:20.540
But it looks so expensive.

41:20.540 --> 41:22.460
It does look expensive, yes.

41:22.460 --> 41:23.300
It is expensive.

41:23.300 --> 41:24.660
It is very expensive, yeah.

41:24.660 --> 41:25.940
You guys keep having this conversation

41:25.940 --> 41:29.460
as the red lights are just like blinking and flashing.

41:29.460 --> 41:31.140
Vincenzi just makes a call.

41:35.620 --> 41:36.460
The lights...

41:36.460 --> 41:38.820
Roll bureaucracy real quick, Vincenzi.

41:41.180 --> 41:42.380
Crit fail.

41:42.380 --> 41:44.020
Oh shit, I thought it was a crit pass.

41:44.020 --> 41:45.380
22 on a 10.

41:46.460 --> 41:47.300
Very cool.

41:47.300 --> 41:48.460
Is there something better than bureaucracy

41:48.460 --> 41:49.780
you could justify?

41:49.780 --> 41:50.820
I'm sure there is.

41:50.860 --> 41:51.860
How about...

41:55.300 --> 41:57.460
Really feels like it would be bureaucracy.

41:57.460 --> 41:59.220
You seem like you're really trying

41:59.220 --> 42:00.060
to come up with something.

42:00.060 --> 42:00.900
Italian.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.820
It's an Italian security system.

42:06.700 --> 42:10.300
And I speak to the security guys in Italian on the phone.

42:13.740 --> 42:14.940
I'm gonna go with a no.

42:18.020 --> 42:20.700
This is one of those excellent times

42:21.540 --> 42:25.780
when you have to put your foot down and say no.

42:25.780 --> 42:27.260
I love saying yes.

42:27.260 --> 42:28.780
Not a chance in this case.

42:28.780 --> 42:32.260
As you call your own security company,

42:32.260 --> 42:33.500
they have your direct number.

42:33.500 --> 42:34.740
So someone picks up there.

42:34.740 --> 42:35.780
Hey, what's up?

42:35.780 --> 42:40.540
Hey, no one's breaking into the building

42:40.540 --> 42:42.340
that Holy Cow Farms is in.

42:42.340 --> 42:44.140
So turn off the alarm.

42:44.140 --> 42:46.500
Oh, okay.

42:46.500 --> 42:48.380
No, what do you mean?

42:48.380 --> 42:49.340
How do you know?

42:49.340 --> 42:50.180
What do you mean?

42:50.180 --> 42:51.500
Who called you?

42:51.500 --> 42:54.380
I'm sorry to kind of bark up the ladder,

42:54.380 --> 42:57.220
but I feel like maybe following orders

42:57.220 --> 42:58.700
isn't what you hired me to do.

42:58.700 --> 43:00.460
You hired me because I'm a small individual

43:00.460 --> 43:01.660
who thinks of myself, you know?

43:01.660 --> 43:02.500
Damn it.

43:05.380 --> 43:08.220
You'll never make that mistake again.

43:08.220 --> 43:09.060
Fuck.

43:09.060 --> 43:09.900
And he hangs up.

43:09.900 --> 43:11.580
I think you gotta kill that guy.

43:11.580 --> 43:12.420
Fantastic.

43:13.540 --> 43:17.100
Oh, hey, that might be your first job out of here.

43:18.020 --> 43:18.860
Oh.

43:18.860 --> 43:20.540
I call back and get that guy's name.

43:20.540 --> 43:22.340
I thought you were offering this kid

43:22.340 --> 43:24.780
a legitimate job and moon rocks.

43:24.780 --> 43:26.260
Yeah, I've never killed before.

43:26.260 --> 43:28.100
It's not really my thing.

43:28.100 --> 43:29.940
God willing, you'll never have to.

43:29.940 --> 43:30.780
Forget I said anything.

43:30.780 --> 43:31.980
We'll talk about it afterwards.

43:31.980 --> 43:34.320
And then he just writes down the guy's name

43:34.320 --> 43:35.160
that was on the phone.

43:35.160 --> 43:37.580
We're gonna have a real wacky dynamic

43:37.580 --> 43:40.620
when we're three grandfathers living.

43:40.620 --> 43:41.460
Yeah, wack.

43:41.460 --> 43:42.300
It's Shelly's family.

43:42.300 --> 43:43.620
Exactly wacky.

43:43.620 --> 43:47.260
The rat that lives in the basement.

43:49.260 --> 43:50.500
It's a sitcom.

43:52.060 --> 43:53.780
Dinner's ready, basement rat.

43:54.820 --> 43:56.980
As you guys are having this conversation.

43:57.980 --> 43:59.660
Broccoli again.

43:59.660 --> 44:00.660
Shelly St. Blythe.

44:00.660 --> 44:01.700
Now, now.

44:01.700 --> 44:04.500
Shelly St. Blythe has been dutifully going through

44:04.500 --> 44:07.740
the different VHS cassettes and finding the day

44:07.740 --> 44:10.380
that is just from two days ago.

44:10.420 --> 44:12.820
The day that was the last time

44:12.820 --> 44:15.840
that Dr. Brock Hargrave had come into Holy Cow Farms

44:15.840 --> 44:19.860
and the day that his coworker did not ever clock out.

44:19.860 --> 44:22.880
And you see on the security footage,

44:22.880 --> 44:26.420
the two of them around, I don't know, 3.30,

44:26.420 --> 44:30.940
walk into the kitchen area where there's no camera present.

44:30.940 --> 44:31.780
Damn it.

44:31.780 --> 44:34.380
It's so important to have a camera in the kitchen.

44:34.380 --> 44:37.040
You gotta see who steals your yogurt, I imagine,

44:37.040 --> 44:38.660
if you have a refrigerator.

44:38.700 --> 44:42.020
That's the prime place where most office thefts occurs,

44:42.020 --> 44:42.860
the kitchen.

44:42.860 --> 44:45.780
And except for bathrooms, it's where most accidents occur.

44:46.740 --> 44:47.940
Yeah.

44:47.940 --> 44:51.540
And you see Dr. Brock Hargrave at Holy Cow Farms.

44:51.540 --> 44:55.060
He is wearing the exact same clothes

44:55.060 --> 44:57.300
that you've always seen him in.

44:57.300 --> 45:01.300
He is in full-blown field archaeologist gear

45:01.300 --> 45:02.900
working at this office.

45:02.900 --> 45:04.260
And a cowboy hat?

45:04.260 --> 45:06.580
Yep, cowboy hat included.

45:06.580 --> 45:11.500
And when he walks out of this kitchen area

45:11.500 --> 45:14.740
back into frame, into the office,

45:14.740 --> 45:18.380
he is holding an open yogurt container.

45:18.380 --> 45:23.140
The spoon is just like hanging limply in his other hand,

45:23.140 --> 45:26.540
his mouth agape as it looks down.

45:26.540 --> 45:31.540
And the hand with the spoon in it kind of rubs at his belly,

45:31.900 --> 45:35.980
looks up directly into the security camera,

45:36.220 --> 45:39.420
turns around, looks back at the room where he came from,

45:39.420 --> 45:42.940
looks back at the security camera, nervously smiles,

45:42.940 --> 45:45.780
looking at his belly and rubbing it continuously

45:45.780 --> 45:47.300
as he walks back.

45:47.300 --> 45:49.700
And is this the last time we've seen

45:49.700 --> 45:52.940
this the friend appear again on cameras?

45:52.940 --> 45:54.920
For the rest of that day and for the next day,

45:54.920 --> 45:58.260
as you skim through, you do not see this coworker.

45:58.260 --> 46:00.060
Well, he fucking ate him.

46:00.060 --> 46:02.340
Shelly, you know this guy.

46:02.340 --> 46:04.940
Is that his normal sort of behavior?

46:04.940 --> 46:08.380
I've never seen how he reacts to yogurt himself,

46:08.380 --> 46:12.260
but no, in general, he does not rub his belly,

46:12.260 --> 46:13.880
satisfied after a meal.

46:15.580 --> 46:17.980
The only time I ever saw him rub his belly like that

46:17.980 --> 46:20.780
was when he ate a man.

46:20.780 --> 46:25.820
As he is wont to do.

46:25.820 --> 46:29.180
The more alarming thing is that his friend did not re-emerge.

46:29.180 --> 46:32.080
That friend could still be somewhere in that kitchen

46:32.080 --> 46:32.920
as we speak.

46:32.920 --> 46:34.300
Let's go open the fridge.

46:34.300 --> 46:36.080
As you guys walk over to the kitchen,

46:36.080 --> 46:40.220
you hear sirens in the distance through the open windows

46:40.220 --> 46:42.420
of the eighth floor of this office building.

46:42.420 --> 46:43.260
Oh, right.

46:43.260 --> 46:44.840
That time we called security

46:44.840 --> 46:48.220
and then they clearly knew we were lying.

46:48.220 --> 46:50.860
And that other time where I took the phone

46:51.900 --> 46:53.700
and pretended to be someone.

46:53.700 --> 46:55.700
And now I'm thinking maybe she knew

46:55.700 --> 46:58.100
I wasn't pretending to be people so good.

46:58.500 --> 47:03.100
As we all look into the camera.

47:03.100 --> 47:08.100
Everyone, Jim's the camera, since we're here.

47:09.220 --> 47:12.620
So quick search the kitchen before we've run.

47:12.620 --> 47:15.700
I can show y'all how to climb down a fire escape.

47:15.700 --> 47:17.780
What's the fastest way to the sewers?

47:17.780 --> 47:21.020
You are definitely going to be able to get out of here

47:21.020 --> 47:22.900
cleanly if you leave now.

47:22.900 --> 47:26.740
If you search the kitchen, you're going to maybe risk it.

47:26.860 --> 47:29.020
Just like a quick pop open the fridge

47:29.020 --> 47:30.660
to see if there's not a body in there.

47:30.660 --> 47:31.800
Oh, there's no body in the fridge.

47:31.800 --> 47:33.260
All right, let's get the fuck out of here.

47:33.260 --> 47:35.900
Vincenty pulls his gun out of his briefcase

47:35.900 --> 47:38.940
and wants to look around just a little harder.

47:38.940 --> 47:40.680
Okay, are the rest of you staying or going?

47:40.680 --> 47:43.940
I'll scope things out from the roof.

47:43.940 --> 47:45.780
Even though, let me tell you,

47:45.780 --> 47:48.640
the fastest way to the sewer is through the toilet.

47:51.900 --> 47:52.720
Since you asked.

47:52.720 --> 47:54.060
Vincenty agrees, he's like.

47:54.060 --> 47:54.900
Vincent.

47:56.180 --> 47:59.620
We'll flush ourselves down the toilet to escape the cops.

47:59.620 --> 48:01.580
They'll never expect it.

48:01.580 --> 48:02.540
In a place like this,

48:02.540 --> 48:05.180
they might have an industrial sized one.

48:05.180 --> 48:06.460
They got cows here.

48:06.460 --> 48:07.300
For Kevin.

48:08.180 --> 48:11.780
They've got cow shitters here, I'm sure of it.

48:11.780 --> 48:13.020
Here in the office office,

48:13.020 --> 48:15.740
on the eighth floor of this office building.

48:15.740 --> 48:17.340
Yes, definitely.

48:17.340 --> 48:19.420
Well, yeah, that's why there's not cow shit everywhere.

48:19.420 --> 48:20.940
That's exactly right, because the cow shitter,

48:20.940 --> 48:22.700
the single one.

48:22.700 --> 48:26.460
Okay, so are we flushing ourselves down this cow shitter?

48:26.460 --> 48:28.180
Are we running out the back door?

48:28.180 --> 48:30.260
Looking at this slightly large toilet,

48:30.260 --> 48:32.900
do you think, I don't know if I'm gonna live.

48:32.900 --> 48:36.320
Vincenty wants to look in the kitchen first.

48:36.320 --> 48:37.540
Go ahead and roll search, I suppose.

48:37.540 --> 48:41.520
Yeah, he thinks back to all of the crimes

48:41.520 --> 48:44.100
he has cleaned up in kitchens.

48:44.100 --> 48:44.940
Natch.

48:44.940 --> 48:47.340
And he's like, I've never committed a crime

48:47.340 --> 48:49.660
in a kitchen, I guess.

48:49.660 --> 48:51.780
We can't hear you, we're far down the cow shitter.

48:51.780 --> 48:53.620
That's right.

48:53.620 --> 48:55.540
Wait, where'd you guys go?

48:55.540 --> 48:59.260
You guys take off running out of this office,

48:59.260 --> 49:01.420
closing the door behind you.

49:01.420 --> 49:04.520
Is anyone trying to clean up any of the mess

49:04.520 --> 49:06.780
that you've made since you've been here,

49:06.780 --> 49:08.740
shoving everything kind of back where it was?

49:08.740 --> 49:10.260
The only mess would be Hargrave's desk, right?

49:10.260 --> 49:11.100
That's right, yeah.

49:11.100 --> 49:14.260
Then yeah, probably as we're running past it,

49:14.260 --> 49:17.420
he would try to at least close up the secret panel

49:17.420 --> 49:18.820
that had the stuff inside it.

49:18.820 --> 49:19.640
Done.

49:19.640 --> 49:21.700
And you guys head down the hallway,

49:22.620 --> 49:24.460
you're taking the stairs to the elevator.

49:24.460 --> 49:27.300
Smart, elevator's out when the alarm's on.

49:27.300 --> 49:30.300
I'll meet you guys down there, I'm taking the elevator.

49:30.300 --> 49:31.140
No, I'm not really.

49:31.140 --> 49:32.340
You click the button.

49:32.340 --> 49:34.840
I comically grabbed the doctor by his shirt,

49:35.900 --> 49:37.960
falling down the stairs.

49:37.960 --> 49:39.740
Eight floors down.

49:39.740 --> 49:42.500
Go ahead and roll athletics.

49:42.500 --> 49:43.420
Well.

49:43.420 --> 49:45.980
Everybody, everybody, everybody, athletics.

49:45.980 --> 49:47.420
This is what I'm made for.

49:48.820 --> 49:49.660
Nope.

49:49.660 --> 49:52.540
With the doctor on my back, I trip.

49:53.780 --> 49:55.500
Oh no, did we all fail?

49:55.500 --> 49:56.340
I failed.

49:56.340 --> 49:57.700
I failed.

49:57.700 --> 50:00.400
I forgot to eat any food for days.

50:01.820 --> 50:03.240
For some dry ramen.

50:04.220 --> 50:07.100
And now I'm out of energy.

50:07.100 --> 50:08.800
Vincenti passes.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.140
Oh, he just fucking dies?

50:11.660 --> 50:12.500
Oh, wait.

50:13.180 --> 50:16.580
You definitely run down the stairs easy peasy

50:16.580 --> 50:18.140
and you look back and we're all just like

50:18.140 --> 50:21.580
hanging off the railing in awkward angles.

50:21.580 --> 50:25.140
Just exhausted, covered in flop sweat

50:25.140 --> 50:27.980
as you've made it down the end of this

50:27.980 --> 50:32.980
un-air conditioned stairwell in July heat here in the city.

50:32.980 --> 50:37.260
It is sweltering and you all are dripping mops

50:37.260 --> 50:38.860
when you arrive at the bottom.

50:38.860 --> 50:41.260
In the meantime, I turn around and saw

50:41.260 --> 50:43.580
that they were not gonna make it out quick enough.

50:43.580 --> 50:47.260
So, Vincenti runs out the door they came in.

50:47.260 --> 50:48.100
Yep.

50:48.100 --> 50:49.860
Runs a couple streets down and fires off

50:49.860 --> 50:51.660
a couple shots on his gun.

50:51.660 --> 50:53.940
That is a long turn that you just did.

50:53.940 --> 50:55.680
Yeah, you ran two blocks.

50:55.680 --> 50:58.100
A block away.

50:58.100 --> 51:01.800
I wanna draw attention elsewhere.

51:04.380 --> 51:05.220
Okay, sounds good.

51:05.220 --> 51:08.780
So, Vincenti, you are a block away,

51:08.780 --> 51:10.180
away from the parking lot

51:10.180 --> 51:12.460
and you are firing your gun in the air

51:12.460 --> 51:15.780
as the rest of you get into the...

51:15.780 --> 51:18.580
To like the level five is on the wall.

51:21.220 --> 51:23.860
It feels a lot faster when you take the elevator.

51:26.420 --> 51:27.380
Trust me, it's not.

51:27.380 --> 51:29.000
This way is a lot speedier.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.680
I feel like I should have been able to do this.

51:32.680 --> 51:33.980
This is the thing I'm good at.

51:33.980 --> 51:36.100
Yeah, me too.

51:36.100 --> 51:38.940
But we've got the doctor care like stretched between us.

51:38.940 --> 51:39.780
Oh yeah.

51:40.140 --> 51:42.340
Believe it or not, I'm pretty fit for my age.

51:43.340 --> 51:45.100
I just am having trouble today.

51:46.020 --> 51:47.500
65.

51:47.500 --> 51:48.340
Okay.

51:48.340 --> 51:49.460
I've never been in that good a shape.

51:49.460 --> 51:50.780
I just got lucky today.

51:53.300 --> 51:56.300
Which explains why you are far off.

51:56.300 --> 51:58.860
You see sirens in the distance, they turn

51:58.860 --> 52:01.420
and as they're heading down the street

52:01.420 --> 52:02.940
that would lead them to the parking lot

52:02.940 --> 52:06.540
for this exact reasoning, they hear the gunshots

52:06.540 --> 52:09.020
and immediately make a turn

52:09.020 --> 52:12.000
and begin heading in your direction.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.340
You also see the stretch Escalade

52:15.340 --> 52:18.140
pull up to the front of the office building.

52:18.140 --> 52:19.740
I ran in to grab my Jeep.

52:19.740 --> 52:22.420
You sprint across the parking lot to your Jeep

52:22.420 --> 52:24.560
as these sirens are getting closer

52:24.560 --> 52:29.260
and they are barreling down on Vincente Bowery.

52:29.260 --> 52:31.660
He puts his gun back in his briefcase

52:31.660 --> 52:36.060
and just walks towards the Escalade casually.

52:37.420 --> 52:40.340
I mean, you did a sacrifice move for the other three

52:40.340 --> 52:44.500
and so the security car pulls up in front of you

52:44.500 --> 52:47.940
and the window rolls down and I want you to roll

52:47.940 --> 52:50.220
a charisma real quick right off the bat.

52:50.220 --> 52:51.380
Actually, no, don't roll.

52:51.380 --> 52:52.780
Tell me what your charisma is.

52:52.780 --> 52:53.620
Passive.

52:53.620 --> 52:54.440
80.

52:54.440 --> 52:55.780
Jesus Christ.

52:55.780 --> 52:57.500
Yeah, could my 80 athletics have gotten me

52:57.500 --> 53:00.660
a passive success to go down the stairs?

53:00.700 --> 53:01.540
No.

53:05.060 --> 53:05.900
No.

53:05.900 --> 53:10.900
And so the security guy rolls down the window

53:11.500 --> 53:15.180
and is like, hey there mister, did you see anyone

53:15.180 --> 53:17.620
firing off a gun up in the air over?

53:17.620 --> 53:19.820
And he points right to where you just were

53:19.820 --> 53:21.420
like two minutes ago.

53:21.420 --> 53:22.260
Bitch face?

53:22.260 --> 53:23.080
Yeah.

53:23.080 --> 53:24.920
You know what I mean?

53:24.920 --> 53:29.920
Yeah, I saw, it was a super, super tall guy

53:36.280 --> 53:41.280
with like super long hair and really huge long fingernails

53:42.160 --> 53:47.160
and he wasn't wearing any clothes and he screamed,

53:47.160 --> 53:50.020
I'm gonna run all the way that way.

53:50.020 --> 53:55.020
And he took off running in the opposite direction

53:55.060 --> 53:57.620
of where I, I heard him say he's going that way.

53:57.620 --> 54:01.540
I said, I'm getting way far away from him, he's scary.

54:01.540 --> 54:03.500
And so that's why I'm walking this way.

54:04.460 --> 54:06.080
Anyway, you better go get him.

54:09.100 --> 54:12.580
I think with your 80 charisma and just seeing

54:12.580 --> 54:13.420
the vision of you.

54:13.420 --> 54:14.500
And it was such a good lie.

54:14.500 --> 54:16.100
It was such a good lie.

54:16.100 --> 54:20.180
Also, this was before I started hiring smart people

54:20.180 --> 54:22.660
to work for me and this was just one of the goons

54:22.660 --> 54:24.460
that works for my security company.

54:24.460 --> 54:28.620
Yeah, the inside of every one of the security cars

54:28.620 --> 54:31.780
has a picture of you hanging from the rear view mirror

54:31.780 --> 54:33.420
to remind them who they work for.

54:34.940 --> 54:37.620
And the logo is like a badge with his face on it.

54:38.820 --> 54:42.700
And he's like, oh, oh, you're, wow, I didn't think

54:42.700 --> 54:45.140
I'd get delicious information from my boss

54:45.300 --> 54:46.140
not like tonight.

54:46.140 --> 54:47.620
You better go catch him.

54:47.620 --> 54:50.060
And immediately pedal to the metal

54:50.060 --> 54:50.900
and press his boss.

54:50.900 --> 54:52.660
I can't do everything around here.

54:56.340 --> 54:58.020
Perfect getaway.

54:59.060 --> 55:01.380
Clean as a whistle.

55:01.380 --> 55:05.580
You see, you see there's the van.

55:05.580 --> 55:07.500
There seems to be like some rummaging about

55:07.500 --> 55:10.740
in the cleaning van that is parked right outside

55:10.740 --> 55:13.580
the front of this office building as you're walking over

55:13.580 --> 55:17.020
to meet the stretch escalate that is now meeting you

55:17.020 --> 55:17.860
in the parking lot.

55:17.860 --> 55:20.860
Did any like mops or brooms happen to fall out

55:20.860 --> 55:23.540
of the back of that van when the doors were open

55:23.540 --> 55:24.780
during the struggle?

55:24.780 --> 55:25.620
Dozens.

55:29.740 --> 55:31.340
Multiple dozens.

55:34.300 --> 55:36.060
It is, you know, an office building.

55:36.060 --> 55:37.460
There's a lot of cleaning.

55:37.460 --> 55:38.820
A lot of sweeping up, a lot of mopping.

55:38.820 --> 55:41.460
You need a different broom for each room.

55:42.380 --> 55:46.380
I mean, yeah, the van, the cleaning van was open

55:46.380 --> 55:47.220
at one point.

55:47.220 --> 55:51.220
Yeah, and dozens of mops and brooms fell out.

55:51.220 --> 55:53.380
I grab, I grab a broom.

55:53.380 --> 55:56.780
I know that this isn't how car doors work,

55:56.780 --> 55:58.860
but I stick it in the, in the handle.

55:58.860 --> 56:01.180
So she can't get out of the back of the van.

56:03.140 --> 56:04.940
Oh, is that what the rummaging was?

56:04.940 --> 56:06.860
I thought the police were another like detail.

56:06.860 --> 56:08.900
No, just someone coming to inside.

56:08.900 --> 56:10.100
Gotcha, gotcha.

56:10.140 --> 56:11.980
So I do that and it works.

56:11.980 --> 56:13.380
Oh, congratulations.

56:13.380 --> 56:15.060
I want to talk through the door.

56:15.060 --> 56:16.060
Hey, Dorothy.

56:17.980 --> 56:20.140
You guys are now pulled up next to this cleaning van

56:20.140 --> 56:22.260
and you've pulled up in such a way to where

56:22.260 --> 56:24.540
that she can't get out of the driver's side,

56:24.540 --> 56:27.300
which is the seat that she's kind of gotten herself into.

56:27.300 --> 56:30.300
And she's looking at you kind of horror,

56:30.300 --> 56:31.820
trying to figure out whether she should roll

56:31.820 --> 56:33.020
down the window or not.

56:34.340 --> 56:35.180
Roll it down.

56:35.180 --> 56:36.900
Have you any Grey Poupon?

56:37.100 --> 56:41.420
I always wanted to say that.

56:44.420 --> 56:45.260
Oh yes.

56:45.260 --> 56:46.100
Very good one.

56:46.100 --> 56:46.940
Very good one.

56:46.940 --> 56:49.780
And she just lifts up a bottle of Evian

56:49.780 --> 56:51.420
and holds it up to you.

56:51.420 --> 56:52.260
Calm down.

56:52.260 --> 56:53.100
Is that poison?

56:53.100 --> 56:54.140
Don't, don't do it Dorothy.

56:55.620 --> 56:56.620
What's the pH?

56:56.620 --> 56:58.220
Cause I can tell you some things.

57:00.020 --> 57:03.620
You see a TED talk about like water levels?

57:03.620 --> 57:05.540
Sweetie, I am your TED talk.

57:06.540 --> 57:09.140
Now tell me, what were you here cleaning up?

57:09.140 --> 57:12.420
Cause I know a company like Trolley's,

57:12.420 --> 57:14.580
they don't do your normal messes.

57:17.140 --> 57:19.140
Do you want a taste of this arm around your neck

57:19.140 --> 57:19.980
one more time?

57:22.460 --> 57:24.100
She rolls up the window quickly.

57:25.700 --> 57:26.740
Don't do that.

57:26.740 --> 57:28.620
Don't do that Dorothy.

57:28.620 --> 57:29.580
Rolling it back up.

57:29.580 --> 57:30.500
Rolling it back up.

57:32.500 --> 57:33.660
Normal cleaning.

57:33.660 --> 57:35.260
Just a regular cleaning, huh?

57:35.860 --> 57:36.940
It breaks down, starts crying.

57:36.940 --> 57:38.140
You guys can roll him it.

57:38.140 --> 57:39.420
Dorothy the kid's right.

57:39.420 --> 57:41.300
You don't need all these brooms and mops

57:41.300 --> 57:42.700
for normal cleaning.

57:42.700 --> 57:44.540
I failed a 19 on a 10.

57:44.540 --> 57:45.380
Damn.

57:45.380 --> 57:46.980
I failed as well.

57:46.980 --> 57:47.820
I failed real bad.

57:47.820 --> 57:48.660
Damn, damn, damn.

57:48.660 --> 57:49.500
Damn, damn, damn, damn.

57:49.500 --> 57:51.100
She seems like she's fine.

57:51.100 --> 57:51.940
She's just crying.

57:51.940 --> 57:54.900
She's like, it's real cleaning.

57:54.900 --> 57:58.300
Well, I don't know why anybody would lie about that.

57:58.300 --> 58:00.700
I don't know what else she can teach us.

58:00.700 --> 58:04.060
No, I'm not a, I'm not doing a TED talk.

58:04.100 --> 58:05.580
I don't have your grapefruit pot.

58:05.580 --> 58:06.820
I just have it in me yard.

58:06.820 --> 58:08.500
That was a joke, Dorothy.

58:08.500 --> 58:09.660
Just a joke.

58:09.660 --> 58:10.500
Okay.

58:11.500 --> 58:12.940
Will you leave?

58:12.940 --> 58:14.780
Yeah.

58:14.780 --> 58:16.660
Should we go to the crystal store?

58:16.660 --> 58:19.260
Should we go to the, the doc's house?

58:19.260 --> 58:21.940
Well, there's also Tri-gate supply.

58:21.940 --> 58:23.460
That is also true.

58:23.460 --> 58:24.300
Good thinking.

58:24.300 --> 58:27.740
Plus this map we got with this space needle.

58:27.740 --> 58:29.580
It's abandoned.

58:29.580 --> 58:32.700
It does seem like his search was concentrated

58:32.700 --> 58:34.260
within that area exactly.

58:34.260 --> 58:36.060
Perhaps we would find more there.

58:36.060 --> 58:37.900
Is any of that stuff near his house?

58:37.900 --> 58:38.980
Oh yeah.

58:40.220 --> 58:41.060
Oh yeah.

58:41.060 --> 58:42.140
Oh yeah.

58:42.140 --> 58:43.100
For sure.

58:43.100 --> 58:45.820
People don't go too far out their neighborhood

58:45.820 --> 58:48.060
here in the city, or at least Dr. Brock Hargrave

58:48.060 --> 58:51.260
seems to stay within his area around his house.

58:51.260 --> 58:53.380
I also have a close personal relationship

58:53.380 --> 58:55.540
with Aaron Strummer so I could give him a call

58:55.540 --> 58:57.340
while we're on our way to another site.

58:57.340 --> 58:59.100
All right, let's check out the house first

58:59.100 --> 59:01.780
and you call this Aaron boy.

59:01.780 --> 59:04.660
He is an Aaron boy of sorts, yes.

59:04.660 --> 59:07.500
Now doc, you be real cool when you call him.

59:07.500 --> 59:10.300
Don't get on a rant about Hargrave.

59:10.300 --> 59:13.300
Don't talk about how he's been seen shopping around

59:13.300 --> 59:16.100
where you shop, or do, but just don't,

59:16.100 --> 59:16.940
don't get angry about it.

59:16.940 --> 59:18.780
I was gonna say that's kind of my inroad.

59:18.780 --> 59:21.380
Yeah, that is the entire line of questioning, I understand.

59:21.380 --> 59:23.060
Do you have any of these crystals you can maybe

59:23.060 --> 59:25.340
put your bad negative energy into

59:25.340 --> 59:26.820
before you give him a call?

59:26.820 --> 59:29.220
Yeah, if any of your crystals have been charging.

59:29.220 --> 59:31.220
Oh, I always have them charging

59:31.220 --> 59:34.260
at least when the phase of the moon aligns, of course.

59:34.260 --> 59:36.500
I wouldn't charge a lapis lazuli

59:36.500 --> 59:38.860
on a waxing crescent, of course.

59:38.860 --> 59:40.700
No, that'd be stupid.

59:40.700 --> 59:44.020
Ridiculous, but I do have this tiger's eye here

59:44.020 --> 59:46.820
and it is charged.

59:46.820 --> 59:49.540
I'd say this is the prime time to be using that.

59:49.540 --> 59:51.860
Wait a minute, doc, has he ever met Craig?

59:53.180 --> 59:55.980
He has not met Craig Mile, no.

59:55.980 --> 01:00:00.060
Perhaps Craig could call as a potential customer.

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.500
That's a great idea.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.380
A career-defining performance, yes.

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.060
It's gonna be tough, doc, but I know you can do it.

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.500
You're a real artist with those things,

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.020
no matter how much they get in the way on the missions.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:16.820
I'll do this, but in the meantime,

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:19.180
we are on our way to Hargrave's home.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.540
Is that what we decided, or was it the Space Needle?

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.620
Hargrave's home.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.300
I see the Space Needle is kind of

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:26.740
potentially an epic conclusion.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.580
Yeah.

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:31.940
It seems like a very dramatic location.

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.500
Then yeah, so that's on our way then.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.660
Boing, boing.

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:42.220
Strummer's Crystals, this is Arren speaking.

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:43.060
Arren?

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:45.100
Hello, hello Arren.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.140
Yes, no, this is Arren.

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:52.140
Arren, this is a friend of Mr. St. Blythe.

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.860
He told me to call you.

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:57.300
Oh yes, that adds up.

01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:02.300
Mr. St. Blythe always calls me Arren.

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:09.260
He's a bit of a, you know.

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.700
And St. Blythe is giving big eyes to everybody in the car.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:12.820
Am I on the right track?

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:13.660
Just keep going, just keep going.

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:14.820
Thumbs up, all right.

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:15.980
You are the puppet.

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.900
You might have gotten me confused with my brother Arren.

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:23.620
Oh, either one I think works if your last name is

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.060
Strummer.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.860
Strummer, and that's the name on the door, right?

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:28.260
That's the one, yes.

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:31.260
Arren Strummer's Resonating Crystals,

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:32.940
though it doesn't say Arren,

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:35.660
just says Strummer's Resonating Crystals above the door

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:38.300
and on all of my marketing.

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:42.580
But you see, I'm a mutual friend there of Mr. St. Blythe

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:45.340
and one Brock Hargrave.

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:50.020
And we were trying to discern if he's been in lately.

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:50.980
What was the name?

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.620
I'm not supposed to say these kinds of things,

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:56.700
but I love tea, so spill it if you must.

01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:00.180
It's Brock Hargrave.

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:04.100
Brock Hargrave, let me look through.

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:08.780
No, no, I'm not seeing this name anywhere on my list.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:13.940
Ask him if anything's gone missing lately.

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:15.740
Have you had anything, you know,

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:19.500
that of maybe great value or historical significance

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.460
go missing lately?

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:23.100
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, go Craig, go Craig.

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.780
I mean, that's something,

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:26.980
that sounds like something that, you know,

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:28.700
St. Blythe would say, right?

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:29.620
Oh, disguise.

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:33.300
Also, I want the two criminals

01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:35.660
and the mercenary to roll criminology.

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:38.100
I would like to roll my puppet skill, thank you.

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.940
Yes, please roll your puppet skill.

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.700
Oh, fuck.

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.900
I got a seven.

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:47.980
That's definitely a pass. Oh, fuck yeah, nice.

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:50.300
I fail a 49 on a 40 puppetry.

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:53.220
Damn, we probably shouldn't have done a FaceTime.

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.060
I failed my criminology roll.

01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:00.260
He's made the puppet hang up.

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:01.900
Yeah, I failed my criminology roll too.

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:03.300
I guess take off your headphones,

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.940
the three of you that are in the room.

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:09.020
And Becca, since you succeeded on your criminology check,

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:11.420
this is knowledge that will just be for you.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.340
Oh, I get a secret.

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:15.220
Wait, you're in the same room?

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.820
They're all doing this thing

01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:18.500
where they put their fingers in their ears

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.980
and then rub them around to make the consistent noise

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:23.780
to not hear my voice.

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.020
Excellent.

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.380
It also hurts their ears the longer we talk.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.380
So, Becca, it actually makes a ton of sense

01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:36.500
that me hook would know Aaron Strummer,

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:39.220
which is Aaron Strummer's brother.

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:43.980
And Aaron Strummer isn't a purveyor of crystals

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:45.500
at the resonating crystal shop.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.820
He is a seller of crystal methamphetamine.

01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:51.500
Yeah, I know a guy.

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.140
I know, yeah, I know that guy.

01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:54.340
That's the guy that I know.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:56.100
Yep, that's the guy that you know.

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:57.660
And this kind of comes to you

01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:00.300
as this conversation is happening on the phone.

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:05.300
Not for me, but many people at the hold

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:07.300
know a thing about that.

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:12.300
So, who is this that I'm speaking to then?

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.420
It's Craig Mile.

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:19.420
Yeah, are you sure this isn't some sort of

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:24.100
crystalline knowledgeable man,

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:26.700
some sort of client of mine?

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.260
Ask him where his brother is.

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:32.580
I was wondering if I could speak to your brother.

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.620
Aaron, let me see if he's here.

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:38.260
Oh, Aaron.

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:42.380
Let me remind you, it's like 9.45 p.m. now at night

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:44.660
and you called the crystal shop.

01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:46.260
That's like their busiest hour.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:51.700
Oh yes, all right, he'll be here.

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.020
Yes, he's coming, he's coming.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.580
Hey y'all, who is this?

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:58.380
Oh, it's Aaron, is it?

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:00.140
Yes, Aaron, who called for me?

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.540
I think you should give me the phone, actually.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.100
I've got someone here who would like to speak to you.

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.340
It's, hang on.

01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:10.060
He can see me, it's FaceTime.

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:13.940
Yeah, you just hold the phone right there, doc.

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:16.140
Is that, is this?

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.780
You know me, Stromer, but don't say my name.

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:22.180
Oh, nice, intimidation over FaceTime.

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:24.020
Immediately though, like, okay.

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:25.100
You owe me a favor.

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:27.820
Oh, okay, like I owe you a favor after the last time?

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:30.620
Yeah, that wasn't my fault while we went down.

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:33.580
Yeah, telling me that that little fish fella of yours

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.700
isn't still hanging about?

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:36.780
You're not still protecting him?

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:38.580
Yeah, we scoot him out of the frame.

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:41.980
Fish face?

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:43.820
Fish face, shut your fucking mouth.

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:44.860
Fish face.

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:46.220
Haven't seen him.

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:48.860
Don't know anything about his whereabouts.

01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:50.620
He's not at the hold, that's for sure.

01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.340
But you know who is?

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:54.300
A lot of your former clients.

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.100
Yeah, so what, what's it to you?

01:05:56.100 --> 01:06:01.020
All they need is one rock slipped in their water

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:04.220
and they'll be back on the choo-choo train.

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:05.300
You know what I mean?

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:08.140
Yes, I understand what you mean.

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.580
What do you want?

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:14.660
I wanna know what you know about Dr. Brock Hargrave,

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.460
cause he had some questions for you.

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:20.140
Questions like, can he get some more?

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:20.980
What do you want?

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:23.340
He's trying to get some crystal.

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.420
I don't know what you want.

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:27.260
Dr. Brock Hargrave is on the crystal?

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:28.220
Why wouldn't he be?

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.460
Yeah, no, I guess we are in the city.

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.860
Oh, you think my crystal's not good enough for a doctor?

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:34.900
Should've known better.

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:37.140
Took me a while to kick the habit.

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:42.140
Why would it be any different for some hob-nosing jungle

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:47.420
seeking cat piss smelling cowboy hat wearing guy?

01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:49.580
Well, if he smells like cat piss,

01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.220
he's probably, you know, I don't know.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.860
Maybe that's why he hasn't made another order in a while.

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:55.500
Trying to make his own.

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:59.860
Okay, well maybe tell me when the last order he got was.

01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:01.580
I don't know, like two weeks ago.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:04.740
Weeks, hmm, okay.

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:07.220
Doesn't help me, man.

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:08.420
Doesn't help me.

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:10.300
Y'all got any questions for this fella?

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.180
I turn the camera around.

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:13.940
This is everybody in our car, by the way,

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.860
in case, don't tell anybody what the place guys call me.

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:17.700
Hello.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.420
Hey, it sounds like you guys are still here.

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:21.500
I'm Jimmy Corrigan, this is Dr. Shelley,

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:22.980
and this is Craig.

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:26.180
There's also a mob man whose name keeps changing.

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:30.460
It's been Vincente the almost the whole time.

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:31.900
Nearly the whole time, but.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.140
Nearly the whole time.

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.780
It sounds like maybe you're selling drugs in my city.

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:39.580
Yeah, are you selling crystals or crystal?

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:42.020
I think you want to talk to my brother, Oren, maybe.

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:43.020
He sells crystals.

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:43.860
Yeah, but.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.300
And you sell crystal methamphetamine.

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.740
But that was a different conversation

01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:49.780
I was trying to have with, you know,

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:50.660
I'm not gonna say a name.

01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:52.860
I picked up on it pretty fucking quick,

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:55.860
and we're gonna have to have a separate conversation

01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:59.540
outside of this because either I get a cut or you get cut.

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.820
That seems fair.

01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:05.300
His eyes get pretty big and he's like, good to know.

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:06.140
Good to know.

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:07.140
I will be in touch.

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:07.980
So you've been, what?

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:10.460
You've been selling this shit to Hargrave?

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:11.900
Yeah, so what?

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:13.700
A perversion of crystals.

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:17.820
Aaron, I think you need to tell people around town

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:21.980
that Meat Hook is in with some classy folks now.

01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:25.620
I got shackles on my shoes or whatever she said.

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.380
Yeah, you can see.

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.580
We're a classy bunch.

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:32.900
And if you keep selling, to our friend Meat Hook.

01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:36.660
You're gonna what?

01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:37.580
Hurt you.

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:39.820
You look like a scary guy.

01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:42.620
So I'm not gonna mess with you, okay?

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:43.820
I'm not gonna mess.

01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:44.980
In fact, I'll stop.

01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:47.820
I'll stop selling drugs.

01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:50.540
I don't know, it sounds like maybe we could benefit

01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:51.380
from each other.

01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:52.300
I'll call you later.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:54.980
You don't have to stop.

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.820
You just gotta cut me in on it.

01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:58.900
I'll just keep doing what I'm doing and we'll talk later.

01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:01.900
Does he like to do drugs up in a tall tower?

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:03.700
Does he like to do drugs up in a tall,

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:05.780
I don't know what you're talking, I mean,

01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:08.260
oh, you're talking about his, the zeitgeist?

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:09.100
You ever go to the zeitgeist?

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.660
His crazy, yeah, where he's doing all the digging.

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:12.500
Yeah.

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.660
He's doing digging in a tower in the sky?

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:17.100
He's got my children digging at the zeitgeist.

01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:21.860
I don't know, last time I went out there,

01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:24.140
I was like trying to maybe, you know,

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.820
boom, just be a good fella and drive it out to him,

01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:32.820
you know, and I happened to see what he was doing out there,

01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:34.940
doing some digging with his sharp shovel.

01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:36.580
By the space needle?

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:38.620
Yeah, you know, zeitgeist.

01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.500
Sharp shovel, doc, it sounds like him.

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.980
It's a telltale sign, he never leaves home without it.

01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:44.780
Would Vincente know if there's a,

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.820
like a telescope in this tower?

01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:47.660
Oh yeah, there's definitely a telescope in this tower.

01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:50.020
Yeah, he really fucking wants to go there now.

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:54.540
Let's go see where he's been doing his ground fucking.

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:21.180
Is it just food?

01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:54.020
All my muscles work like swims

01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:22.020
Is it just food?
