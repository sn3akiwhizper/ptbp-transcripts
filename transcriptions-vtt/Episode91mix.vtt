00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
Yesterday, I ate a whole bucket of long-deceased crab.

00:05.200 --> 00:11.500
Now y'all know I like to dive right into a slop bucket, putrid or otherwise, but something

00:11.500 --> 00:16.120
about these weird ocean spiders got me feeling nasty.

00:16.120 --> 00:22.400
But not Wolf the dog nasty, just regular diarrhea nasty.

00:23.000 --> 00:32.600
What does not make me feel nasty is broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station

00:32.600 --> 00:40.120
that is also in the past and the present and the future at all times, but also sometimes

00:40.120 --> 00:41.740
none of them.

00:41.740 --> 00:44.520
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Daisy.

00:44.520 --> 00:49.240
If you want to write up something for y'all wolfy to howl, tag the show at Pretending

00:49.240 --> 00:55.800
Pod on Instagram or Twitter, or write up a 5-star review on Apple Podcasts and email

00:55.800 --> 00:59.320
us at PretendingPod at Gmail dot com.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.640
That way you can be like Daisy here.

01:01.640 --> 01:06.600
They write, Hello to everyone in contention and beyond.

01:06.600 --> 01:12.440
Thanks to the weird time stuff going on in contention, Texas has gotten a signal to y'all's

01:12.440 --> 01:18.400
best and only radio station, 694.2 PTBP.

01:18.400 --> 01:23.840
I've been listening for a month or has it only been a few days?

01:23.840 --> 01:26.200
Contention is so weird with its time.

01:26.200 --> 01:32.780
Well, I would just like to take this time to say thank you to Wolf the dog, his producer

01:32.780 --> 01:36.840
and all the people who make this radio segment possible.

01:36.840 --> 01:41.480
Sincerely, Daisy, sending all the love and trash in Texas.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.440
Well, damn, thanks Daisy.

01:43.440 --> 01:49.980
Well, uh, you can keep the love, but I will gladly take your trash offering with glee.

01:49.980 --> 01:55.500
Also remember, we've got a new project for our citizens of contention over on the subreddit.

01:55.500 --> 01:59.520
We are going to write a Delta Green scenario as a community.

01:59.520 --> 02:04.640
Over the next few months, we'll be having prompted writing contests to find the best

02:04.640 --> 02:06.760
meaty chunks y'all can muster.

02:06.760 --> 02:12.280
We'll use each round's winner to inform the next prompt until we have enough juicy morsels

02:12.280 --> 02:14.740
to make ourselves a narrative feast.

02:14.740 --> 02:20.660
To get in on this tub of greasy love, head on down to reddit.com all slash pretending

02:20.660 --> 02:21.920
to be people.

02:21.920 --> 02:26.660
The deadline for submissions here in round one is August 22nd.

02:26.660 --> 02:31.680
Show us what you've got and vote for your favorites to help us choose the winners.

02:31.680 --> 02:36.820
Hey lovers, did you enjoy that bonus episode we released a couple weeks ago?

02:36.820 --> 02:42.480
The one where the boys played Lover in the Ice, the infamously mad fucked up Delta Green

02:42.480 --> 02:45.180
scenario written by Caleb Stokes?

02:45.180 --> 02:49.240
Well, that was just part one of a three part series.

02:49.240 --> 02:54.940
You can find parts two and three over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

02:54.940 --> 02:56.700
There's a link in the show notes.

02:56.700 --> 03:02.300
As you become a Splashylvania Fastpass holder, you'll have access to our entire playthrough

03:02.300 --> 03:07.380
of Lover in the Ice as well as 10 other bonus episodes.

03:07.380 --> 03:13.740
Wherein we play everyone is John the End of the World, Magnum Vice, Fury Force, more Delta

03:13.740 --> 03:18.460
Green, and Kala Cthulhu's original scenario, The Haunting.

03:18.460 --> 03:24.260
You can also listen to the session zero for season one, during which the boys create the

03:24.260 --> 03:28.200
town of contention and discuss character ideas.

03:28.200 --> 03:34.240
And uh, next up on the Patreon docket, some fucking human named Justin is running roll

03:34.240 --> 03:40.280
for shoes in the Den of Sin, August 29th at 7pm central time.

03:40.280 --> 03:44.620
Again, hit that link in the damn show notes, why don't ya?

03:44.620 --> 03:49.700
Speaking of notes, mine here in front of me are all dusty, but I'm pretty sure they say

03:49.700 --> 03:52.900
it's time for the news.

03:52.900 --> 03:57.720
Last time we learned a little about all the good Silas and Mary Cole are doing as the

03:57.760 --> 04:05.080
head honchos here in contention in 1880 something, and then we met four fresh faces of four fine

04:05.080 --> 04:09.400
folks whose lives are about to be turned completely upside down.

04:09.400 --> 04:15.560
Everett Pace, a wily old coot, was lurking around his homestead when he heard a noise

04:15.560 --> 04:17.880
out by his late wife's grave.

04:17.880 --> 04:23.320
Hollering, he ran off the missing Miss Kitty, who was digging with her hands over the burial

04:23.320 --> 04:25.800
site while mumbling to herself.

04:26.120 --> 04:33.640
Jack Pearlman, oh, after overhearing some folks at the saloon spilling tea about Silas

04:33.640 --> 04:39.040
having a teenage girl out on the property of the new mine, trotted home to find one

04:39.040 --> 04:44.960
of his steeds on the edge of the river Styx while a slight humanoid figure bolted toward

04:44.960 --> 04:47.760
the tree line like a wild animal.

04:47.760 --> 04:53.960
Professor Horace Green tried to get some shut eye, but the drunken miner's conversation

04:53.960 --> 04:57.200
next door bled through the walls like lace.

04:57.200 --> 05:02.480
He couldn't help but overhear the slurring about the missing gambler being last seen

05:02.480 --> 05:08.560
having a bit of a shouting match with Silas Cole after finding something unusual down

05:08.560 --> 05:13.000
in the mine which he referred to as living oil.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.640
And finally, Judge Ephraim Courtland, after finally spilling out into the world, recalled

05:19.640 --> 05:26.320
a peculiar statement made by a recent inmate wherein the madman claimed Mary Cole to be

05:26.320 --> 05:28.240
inhuman.

05:28.240 --> 05:33.200
Judge Courtland then headed to the courthouse, which had been stripped of its copper wire

05:33.200 --> 05:38.520
in the night, leaving the building without electricity to the judge's bewilderment.

05:38.520 --> 05:44.880
Tartally, he loped to the church for the town hall meeting about the recent disappearances.

05:44.880 --> 05:50.880
But staying right here forever is my ungodly ability to keep bringing the heat week after

05:50.880 --> 05:55.600
week until you're weak from these sweet, sweet elite beats.

05:55.600 --> 06:00.800
It's the Creek Rocks with Can't You Hear Them Wolves Howlin'

06:14.880 --> 06:22.800
Can't you hear them wolves howlin' All around my poor little darlin'

06:22.800 --> 06:28.800
All around my poor little darlin' I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'

06:36.800 --> 06:42.800
Can't you hear them wolves howlin' All around my poor little darlin'

06:42.800 --> 06:47.760
All around my poor little darlin' I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'

06:47.760 --> 06:52.720
Can't you hear them wolves howlin' All around my poor little darlin'

06:52.720 --> 06:58.720
All around my poor little darlin' I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'

07:06.000 --> 07:10.400
Justin, what do you think you would do for money if you existed before 1900?

07:10.400 --> 07:12.160
Oh, before 1900?

07:12.160 --> 07:14.640
Yeah, like roughly in the 1880s somethings.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.160
Shit.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.560
Shovel up shit I guess.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.720
Because I'd be worthless.

07:24.720 --> 07:25.280
Aww.

07:25.280 --> 07:29.520
I don't know, I'm a big dude. I guess I'd be like some kind of manual laborer or something.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.440
Yeah, we would be in charge.

07:31.440 --> 07:34.400
Oh yeah, I'm strong so I'd beat people into submission.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.640
You could do like bare knuckle boxing.

07:36.640 --> 07:37.680
Yeah, we'd box.

07:37.680 --> 07:41.360
I would be the foreman and Luke would be the person I am mean to all the time.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.480
I would be the boss because I can't do manual labor.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.240
Is that how that works immediately?

07:46.960 --> 07:48.560
No, I'd be a grifter for sure.

07:50.960 --> 07:55.040
Just like flouting from town to town, changing your name.

07:55.040 --> 07:55.840
Quick, what's your name?

07:56.560 --> 07:56.880
John.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.040
Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.160
Wait wait wait, what is it now though?

08:02.160 --> 08:04.800
That guy's like holy shit, that name is my name too.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.240
Oh, nice to meet you Casey.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.000
Luke Shelton here, nice to meet you.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.640
Ooh, no, can I change my answer?

08:12.640 --> 08:14.000
I can't, can I? It's too late.

08:14.000 --> 08:14.480
Too late?

08:14.480 --> 08:16.160
Never mind, go on, go on.

08:16.160 --> 08:16.880
Terrible, man.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.840
Joe, what would you do before 1900?

08:21.840 --> 08:22.560
Would you be a barber?

08:22.560 --> 08:23.840
Oh, could you be a barber?

08:23.840 --> 08:25.680
No, I don't know how to cut hair.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.320
I mean, I could.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.320
I don't know how to be a foreman, but I'm going to.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.760
It's the 1900s, dog.

08:29.760 --> 08:30.480
There's no rules.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.840
It's the 1800s.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.280
The 1800s.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.240
I could learn how to cut hair.

08:34.240 --> 08:38.080
I was going to say, I mean, like a bartender or like a...

08:38.080 --> 08:40.320
Well, the three of us would literally be giants.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.680
Because we're tall?

08:41.680 --> 08:43.360
They weren't, they were short back then?

08:43.360 --> 08:43.600
Yeah.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.160
They were, they were like four foot tall back then.

08:47.120 --> 08:47.680
Hobbits.

08:47.680 --> 08:48.480
I'm almost positive.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.680
When was football invented?

08:49.680 --> 08:53.520
Would we all just be on a football team and like decimate everyone in our pads?

08:53.520 --> 08:54.960
Ooh, can I change my answer?

08:54.960 --> 08:57.520
I want to play baseball in the late 1800s.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.800
I'll teach them how to play if it's...

08:58.800 --> 08:59.680
Oh, nice.

08:59.680 --> 09:00.560
Was it 1870 something?

09:00.560 --> 09:02.880
We're going to teach them how to play baseball.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.360
And it's called Joe ball.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.360
Yep, Joe ball.

09:07.360 --> 09:08.320
After Joe mama.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.000
Are you a first Joe's man or a second Joe's man?

09:12.000 --> 09:12.880
Or do you play third?

09:13.520 --> 09:14.080
Third.

09:14.080 --> 09:14.560
Joe.

09:14.560 --> 09:15.360
I'm a Joe stop.

09:15.360 --> 09:15.680
Home Joe.

09:17.760 --> 09:18.720
Home Joe's man.

09:20.400 --> 09:27.040
If you, if like you were sent back now to like 1880, what could you actually invent?

09:27.040 --> 09:27.760
And like...

09:27.760 --> 09:28.720
Oh, like everything.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.360
Oh, nothing.

09:31.360 --> 09:32.240
Nothing for sure.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.960
I was looking up recliners.

09:35.520 --> 09:40.720
Recliners did not exist in the 1880s, so I think I could invent a recliner.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.160
You could probably figure that out.

09:42.160 --> 09:45.200
I would just do all sorts of music.

09:45.200 --> 09:50.400
I would, for some reason, the first song on my mind is Higher by Creed.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.520
I think they would love that.

09:52.800 --> 09:59.680
You know what I think would legitimately probably go over pretty well is like any stomping music,

09:59.680 --> 10:01.520
like Little Lion Man.

10:01.520 --> 10:02.480
By Stomp?

10:02.480 --> 10:06.000
No, like what, what's, who does Little Lion Man?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.440
Trash can fellas?

10:07.440 --> 10:07.940
No.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.480
Oh, you're talking about Mumford and Sons?

10:10.480 --> 10:11.040
Yeah.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.240
Stomp, stomping music.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.000
Stomping music?

10:16.000 --> 10:16.240
Yeah.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.480
They stomp their feet along with all the songs.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.480
They didn't have a drummer, Thomas.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.920
The lead singer just had a kick drum and that's it.

10:23.920 --> 10:24.880
Is that a true story?

10:24.880 --> 10:26.320
Is that part of their origin story?

10:26.320 --> 10:27.680
Who did that song?

10:27.680 --> 10:30.880
The Ho Hey song with stomping and clapping.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.080
The Ho Hey?

10:32.240 --> 10:34.480
What is that song or what is that band?

10:34.480 --> 10:38.000
You know, like, Hey, they do that a lot throughout the song.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.160
Isn't that Mumford and Sons?

10:40.160 --> 10:40.960
I don't think it is.

10:42.960 --> 10:43.920
The Lumineers.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.520
I was a freshman in college in 2010.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.160
I remember this time very well.

10:50.160 --> 10:53.840
I had the Lumineers album on my iPod for sure.

10:53.840 --> 10:54.560
Hell yeah, dude.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.680
iPod touch?

10:55.680 --> 10:58.800
No, iPod, the big one that held the most.

10:58.800 --> 10:59.280
I don't know.

10:59.280 --> 11:00.240
With the big roundy?

11:00.240 --> 11:01.360
Though with the big roundy, yeah.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.840
Could it play videos that were real tiny?

11:03.840 --> 11:04.400
Like pornographies?

11:04.400 --> 11:05.360
I didn't have any videos.

11:06.240 --> 11:10.080
Did you put any dirty films on your big iPod?

11:11.280 --> 11:13.360
I had explicit music on there.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.680
When were you guys allowed to listen to explicit music?

11:16.320 --> 11:18.800
I was never like not allowed to.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.600
Did you have to hide it?

11:19.600 --> 11:20.560
I just like wouldn't.

11:21.360 --> 11:24.880
By the time that was a problem, I was just downloading everything I wanted.

11:25.760 --> 11:28.240
I listened to a lot of classic rock until

11:28.240 --> 11:30.880
LimeWire and then that's when I got all my stuff.

11:31.600 --> 11:37.200
My parents bought me the Coolio album that had Gangster's Paradise on it on cassette tape.

11:38.320 --> 11:41.760
We were listening to it and it's one of those rap albums that has a lot of skits

11:41.760 --> 11:43.680
and they cuss up a storm in the skits.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.640
I do remember my mom saying something like,

11:46.640 --> 11:49.440
I wish we would have just gotten the soundtrack to Dead Man Walking,

11:49.440 --> 11:54.400
which is where that song is from, instead of this whole Coolio album.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.160
Holy shit, that's so good.

11:57.040 --> 12:00.400
I had a three CD disc changer.

12:01.120 --> 12:06.320
I specifically remember at one point in time, it had Mercy Me,

12:07.120 --> 12:10.880
which was the Christian band who did I Can Only Imagine.

12:12.160 --> 12:18.000
It had that album, it had Linkin Park reanimation remix,

12:18.560 --> 12:21.840
and it had The Bends by Radiohead.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.760
Ooh, good mix.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.400
Interesting.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.880
That's a mix, eclectic.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.400
What year do you think that would have been?

12:29.360 --> 12:31.920
2004?

12:31.920 --> 12:33.040
2004?

12:33.040 --> 12:35.200
Mine would have been just classic rock.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.400
Oh, you're one of those people?

12:36.960 --> 12:37.460
Yeah.

12:38.720 --> 12:41.600
In 2004, for sure, mine would have been,

12:42.160 --> 12:45.360
I think I was still, that would have been the tail end of my Zeppelin phase.

12:45.360 --> 12:51.440
I would have been Led Zeppelin, AC DC, and just one that changes.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.240
My dad's a big John Denver fan,

12:54.240 --> 12:57.120
so I didn't get into classic rock until School of Rock came out.

12:58.080 --> 13:03.360
I was in the only good music is weird, heady, underground rap

13:03.360 --> 13:05.200
that I no longer listen to,

13:05.200 --> 13:08.720
because it's not always the most fun thing to listen to.

13:08.720 --> 13:09.920
Like Eminem?

13:09.920 --> 13:14.320
No, like borderline fucking spoken word sometimes.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.920
Like late Jay-Z.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.000
Or like Tupac, are you going really underground?

13:22.400 --> 13:23.760
Holy shit.

13:23.760 --> 13:24.880
Oh, Joe.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.440
I didn't mean it that way.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.480
I didn't mean it that way.

13:28.480 --> 13:31.280
I was trying to think of another big rapper.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.360
He is alive.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.560
I don't know if you know that.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.840
Joe couldn't have meant it that way,

13:35.840 --> 13:41.520
because he has sheltered Tupac for a few months in his loft.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.280
He's like, I know Tupac's fucked.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.840
That's why we're not allowed over there.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.040
I try and bang the door down,

13:49.040 --> 13:51.840
and Joe started hammering up barricades over.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.160
Quick, Tupac, run!

14:00.000 --> 14:00.720
What's he saying?

14:00.720 --> 14:02.000
Does he have an E.T. in there?

14:04.480 --> 14:06.080
Joe, you got E.T. in there?

14:06.080 --> 14:06.800
Is that E.T.?

14:07.440 --> 14:08.400
Joe's like, yeah!

14:09.760 --> 14:10.640
It's definitely not.

14:10.640 --> 14:11.280
It's an E.T.!

14:11.920 --> 14:12.720
It's an E.T.!

14:12.720 --> 14:14.800
It's not anything else.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.040
It's not Mr. Shakur.

14:17.040 --> 14:17.680
Oh my God.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.960
It's Biggie!

14:20.960 --> 14:21.920
Fine, it's Biggie!

14:23.120 --> 14:24.000
It's 3Pac!

14:25.920 --> 14:27.440
We're gonna have to cut all this, I'm sorry.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.400
Just those last two.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.560
Really ramped ourselves up for the Old West mood here.

14:39.040 --> 14:45.920
So today is the day that is taking place currently.

14:45.920 --> 14:50.800
So this will be the day after Everett's interesting evening,

14:50.800 --> 14:54.160
after Horace Green's attempt at sleep,

14:54.160 --> 14:58.960
and after Jack Perlman's night of fun.

14:59.520 --> 15:03.840
So, Judge Ephraim, Courtland's day that we dove into.

15:05.120 --> 15:08.320
Who's gonna be at the town hall meeting on time?

15:09.040 --> 15:09.440
Not me.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.880
Yeah, I don't think I would either.

15:12.880 --> 15:16.400
I think Everett would be there on time with the night that he had.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.360
Was it mandatory?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.440
Oh right, the disappearances.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.520
Yeah, Horace goes.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.760
I'll be there but not on time, for sure.

15:23.760 --> 15:24.320
Okay.

15:24.320 --> 15:24.800
Rough night.

15:24.800 --> 15:28.080
Sorry, I'm still thinking about how Joe harbored Tupac from,

15:30.240 --> 15:31.840
you know, the Illuminati or whatever.

15:35.040 --> 15:35.920
Or whatever.

15:35.920 --> 15:36.640
Myriad.

15:36.640 --> 15:37.120
There it is.

15:37.840 --> 15:41.040
Luke and Justin, take your headphones off.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.160
Okie dokie.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.680
Oh my god, are you drinking a Coke?

15:43.680 --> 15:44.640
Like a straight Coke?

15:45.520 --> 15:46.640
Yeah, it's Coke Zero.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.200
Nice, no calories.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.200
Dr. Pepper 10.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.560
It's only for men.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.320
That was so fucking weird.

15:54.320 --> 15:58.000
That was a terrible, terrible marketing campaign.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.200
Thank god it backfired.

15:59.760 --> 16:00.720
No joke.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.480
Am I headphones off?

16:02.480 --> 16:03.840
No, keep them on, please.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.320
Okay, bye bye.

16:12.800 --> 16:21.520
The dusty church's pews are full and the air is thick on this humid summer day.

16:21.520 --> 16:25.600
Sweat is dripping down the skin of all in attendance.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.960
And the smell in here?

16:26.960 --> 16:27.280
Foul.

16:28.080 --> 16:32.880
Thankfully, this is a lunch meeting, so the sun isn't shining directly through the windows,

16:32.880 --> 16:37.520
but the shade just lends itself to the wetness of the air.

16:38.400 --> 16:44.400
Bobby Custard takes his place at the pulpit and begins speaking before the unruly crowd

16:44.400 --> 16:45.120
simmers down.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.720
Alrighty there folks, settle down, settle down.

16:48.720 --> 16:54.400
As you all well know, we're here today to discuss the recent happenings regarding the

16:54.400 --> 16:56.880
disappearances of all them saloon folk.

16:57.600 --> 17:02.480
First off, does anyone have any information here to bring forward?

17:02.480 --> 17:08.080
Everett from the back, he's still kind of tottering his way in and he hears the tail

17:08.080 --> 17:08.560
end of that.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.280
Yeah, I reckon I could shed some light on something that's going on.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.200
I got some information.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.280
Oh, Mr. Pace, yes, of course.

17:18.320 --> 17:21.760
Round last night, I reckon the moon was high up there.

17:21.760 --> 17:24.160
It must have been two in the morning or something.

17:24.160 --> 17:26.960
There was a ruckus out there by the tree line.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.840
There's something that means a lot to me out there.

17:31.840 --> 17:35.840
It's where I buried my wife.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.600
There's a gasp through the crowd.

17:37.600 --> 17:42.560
Everyone's, there was somebody out there digging and it bothered me.

17:42.560 --> 17:46.160
I walked up on and it was Miss Kitty.

17:46.160 --> 17:52.160
And I was trying to tell her that they were looking for her.

17:52.160 --> 17:55.440
And then she looked at me and then she just took off running in the woods.

17:55.440 --> 17:58.400
I hollered after, but you know, I can't keep up with anybody these days.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.200
And I don't know what happened after that.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.080
Y'all have a good day.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.200
And he starts walking out.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.320
Oh, no, no, no.

18:04.320 --> 18:08.400
Hey there, uh, Mr. Pace, please, please stay.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.760
If you clearly have some sort of information.

18:11.760 --> 18:18.720
And as Bobby is trying to trying to keep you in here, you see Thuro Sexton, who you know

18:18.720 --> 18:26.880
as the night watch at the cemetery stands up, hat in hand.

18:26.880 --> 18:36.320
Um, I, Everett, I thought I was crazy, but the fact that you said that makes me feel

18:36.320 --> 18:41.920
okay saying this here now today here in front of everyone and go.

18:44.400 --> 18:52.640
Last night, I scared off that Miss Kitty from digging up bodies in their own cemetery.

18:53.120 --> 18:59.920
And when she ran off, I swear to God, I mean, sorry, preach.

18:59.920 --> 19:04.080
I, I promise I Bible swear.

19:04.080 --> 19:04.800
I swear.

19:04.800 --> 19:05.360
I don't know.

19:05.360 --> 19:08.000
I, I, I'm telling truth.

19:09.120 --> 19:16.000
She had three corpses on her back and she ran off with them heading down south.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.640
Miss Kitty's a grave robber.

19:18.640 --> 19:19.760
Is that what you're trying to?

19:20.480 --> 19:30.720
I don't know why she was going for so many bodies, but she clearly needed more than three

19:30.720 --> 19:35.280
and must have headed down to your property there, sir.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.960
I'm deeply sorry.

19:37.680 --> 19:38.240
Thank goodness.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.880
She didn't, she didn't get down in that hole deep enough.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.920
I was able to put some earth wrap back on there.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.680
She didn't get deep enough.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.680
You must, you got her.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.400
I would have never expected Miss Kitty.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.400
Was she on hard times or something?

19:52.400 --> 19:54.240
I think she's been gone.

19:54.240 --> 19:57.920
She, she always had the money to live her life.

20:00.000 --> 20:06.000
I often will go to the, and then he looks down and you see his wife looking back up

20:06.000 --> 20:12.080
at him with huge eyes and he's like, I mean, I, she, I don't know.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.520
Oh my goodness.

20:15.520 --> 20:20.400
I did not expect this much information to come out so soon.

20:20.400 --> 20:24.800
Like much appreciated from the both of you speaking up like this.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.520
Jack, what horse are you riding on your way in?

20:35.520 --> 20:37.520
Same old, same old Jeremiah.

20:38.160 --> 20:47.200
So these two fucking gorgeous steeds are taking these two men of very opposing distinctive

20:47.200 --> 20:52.480
features toward the church house at the exact same time.

20:52.480 --> 20:59.360
And Jack Pearlman and Judge Ephraim Courtland arrive almost simultaneously.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.960
I kind of look over Ephraim and kind of nod to him.

21:04.240 --> 21:05.440
God damn it.

21:05.440 --> 21:09.840
Ephraim gets off his horse and just looks at him and starts walking towards the meeting.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.640
I like tie up my, do you tie up a horse?

21:12.640 --> 21:13.360
We'll say yeah.

21:13.360 --> 21:14.480
You tie, tie up my horse.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.000
You got to tie up that horse.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.400
Otherwise any old random groundhogs can come up and they're scaring off around there and

21:20.400 --> 21:22.560
take off without a horse driving around.

21:22.560 --> 21:25.040
Exactly the words I would have also used.

21:25.040 --> 21:25.540
Same.

21:26.640 --> 21:31.760
I give Jeremiah a good little pet and head on in following the nasty man.

21:31.760 --> 21:35.440
Spits on the ground.

21:44.160 --> 21:50.720
The doors bust wide open to the church and you see the towering six foot ten, 300 pound

21:50.720 --> 21:54.080
of disgusting flesh falling from itself.

21:54.160 --> 22:03.600
Presence of Judge Ephraim Courtland spit on the ground as he walks in to the church with

22:03.600 --> 22:10.480
Jack Pearlman, a much different hotter figure, following right behind.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.600
This man's sexy.

22:16.320 --> 22:22.320
All the men and women in the audience, the congregation, the town congregation, we're

22:22.320 --> 22:24.640
in a church, it's not a service, whatever.

22:24.640 --> 22:32.640
They all become green with the sight of Judge Courtland and then immediately blood rushes

22:32.640 --> 22:39.440
to certain spots and especially cheeks when Jack Pearlman walks into the church.

22:39.440 --> 22:45.120
Okay, so you're saying, you're saying that we got Miss Kitty just living around here.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.800
Oh, hello there Judge.

22:47.280 --> 22:53.600
Um, I was just asking to see if there's anyone who had any sort of information to bring forward

22:53.600 --> 22:56.320
about the disappearances recently of the saloon.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.080
My copper wire got stolen.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.480
Can't turn the lights on.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.480
That's why I'm here.

23:02.480 --> 23:07.440
And the judge is just standing in the aisle and everyone's just kind of looking at him.

23:07.440 --> 23:08.720
Uh, okay.

23:09.600 --> 23:16.080
Is that, I'm sure, do you want me as like Sheriff, you want me to take care of that?

23:16.880 --> 23:17.280
Get it.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.800
I can't turn my lights on.

23:20.160 --> 23:20.480
Okay.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.680
That'll be the first thing that we take care of after this.

23:23.680 --> 23:27.200
Yeah, no, what the hell else are you talking about here?

23:27.200 --> 23:32.000
That my secretary told me to come here because of my wires.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.480
Thought that was what this meeting was about.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.800
About the disappearances currently.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.560
Well, and he sits down.

23:39.120 --> 23:40.080
There's like the pew.

23:40.080 --> 23:44.320
He just like scoots someone over and sits like right next to the aisle.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.080
Rhubarb, rhubarb.

23:46.080 --> 23:51.360
Jack Pearlman, I'm assuming was kind of like with him upon entering, but whenever he started

23:52.000 --> 23:57.600
mouthing off and yelling, he kind of just like scooted sideways kind of a way to the,

23:57.600 --> 24:02.800
the back of the, the church to kind of listen and not be associated with him at all.

24:02.800 --> 24:03.760
Yeah, makes sense.

24:04.320 --> 24:08.880
Professor Horace Green, any, uh, just like what's running through your head?

24:08.880 --> 24:10.560
Horace Green is just reading a book.

24:10.560 --> 24:13.280
And that, uh, yes, no, we'll definitely take care of that.

24:13.280 --> 24:13.600
Sure.

24:13.600 --> 24:19.040
As, as soon as we're done here, first thing that I look into for sure, but we're talking

24:19.040 --> 24:25.920
about these disappearances and that is what we need to discuss now that we've got, uh,

24:25.920 --> 24:27.840
Satan's last night of Ms.

24:27.840 --> 24:29.280
Kitty out and about.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.040
Grave Robin.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.840
Kitty was grave Robin.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.160
I seen her with my own two eyes.

24:37.040 --> 24:37.920
Uh, yes.

24:37.920 --> 24:44.640
And, and, and I too says thorough Sexton who's the nightwatch, the cemetery.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.800
What'd you ever, what'd you dig up?

24:46.800 --> 24:48.000
What'd you see her dig up?

24:48.000 --> 24:50.720
It was three old, old bodies.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.280
I run her off before she could get anything of mine.

24:53.280 --> 24:53.840
Who was it?

24:54.400 --> 24:55.360
Who'd you dig up?

24:55.360 --> 24:55.840
Yeah.

24:55.840 --> 24:58.560
Who, who'd you get from the cemetery over there?

24:58.560 --> 25:06.400
It was, uh, Sally Jensen who, as we all know, pass God 30 years ago now.

25:06.960 --> 25:12.000
Mitzi Frankenship, who unfortunately left us 34 years ago.

25:12.960 --> 25:21.920
And Rebecca Feinsteem, Feinsteem, Rebecca Feinsteem, Steem.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.400
I can't pronounce it.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.520
It's a lot of consonants all in a row.

25:28.160 --> 25:38.960
It's S T E I N F P F I E M P Z F.

25:38.960 --> 25:45.600
I don't know how to say that, but she died 37 years ago.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.840
She, she taught me in school.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.560
I remember I had to spell her name.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.600
It had every letter of the alphabet.

25:57.520 --> 26:01.760
I'm sorry for your loss.

26:01.760 --> 26:08.240
I tried to get to her, but, um, I'm a heavy sleeper.

26:10.480 --> 26:14.880
So some of his kitty disappeared him or what?

26:14.880 --> 26:16.640
Uh, yes, just seemingly.

26:16.640 --> 26:22.240
So Ms. Kitty did come around and, uh, and it was taken by, she took three before she

26:22.240 --> 26:27.200
headed off three from the cemetery for she headed off up to the pace place.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.680
She must've dropped off them bodies somewhere along the way.

26:29.680 --> 26:30.480
Cause she didn't have them.

26:30.480 --> 26:33.440
When she came up to my place, what was she doing there?

26:33.440 --> 26:35.920
She's trying to dig up Claire's grave.

26:37.840 --> 26:38.160
Okay.

26:38.160 --> 26:38.880
Let's go get her.

26:39.520 --> 26:40.080
Go get her.

26:40.080 --> 26:40.560
What?

26:40.560 --> 26:41.920
You know where she is?

26:41.920 --> 26:43.280
I figured you might.

26:43.280 --> 26:44.400
What are we even here for?

26:44.400 --> 26:48.640
If you don't know where she is, pardon, pardon, pardon me, judge.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.320
But what do you mean by let's?

26:51.040 --> 26:56.800
I mean, us, it doesn't really look like you're in much shape to get

26:56.800 --> 27:00.160
anybody much less join a horse riding posse.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.360
Ephraim stands up and points his gun at, at Horace.

27:03.360 --> 27:07.360
Oh my God.

27:07.360 --> 27:10.160
Speaking, I'm speaking as a biologist, sir.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.000
You've seen me ride my horse.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.280
You know, I can ride around.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.600
I don't believe I have seen that, sir.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.400
My mistake.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.440
Shut the fuck up.

27:20.640 --> 27:21.440
Let's go get her.

27:26.800 --> 27:31.600
Shut the fuck up.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.840
When judge says, shut the fuck up.

27:33.840 --> 27:39.200
You see that, um, Bobby custard just puts both of his hands in the air.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.000
Well, you guilty.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.680
Oh, holy shit.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.640
Oh my God.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.480
It's going to kill everyone.

27:52.720 --> 27:57.760
He's got mad monster.

27:57.760 --> 28:02.960
It's just, it's the baddie.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.040
Fuck.

28:11.040 --> 28:16.880
And I holster my gun, get my flask out, take a drink of it, put it back and just sit down.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.080
And the whole crowd goes.

28:18.080 --> 28:23.360
And Jack Pearlman lets off of his pistol grip.

28:23.360 --> 28:28.800
Like he had professor green starts nervously smoking a pipe.

28:30.160 --> 28:30.640
Totally.

28:30.640 --> 28:30.960
Okay.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.400
Completely.

28:32.400 --> 28:32.720
Okay.

28:32.720 --> 28:33.760
No one bats an eye.

28:33.760 --> 28:35.360
Everyone's down for it.

28:35.360 --> 28:36.400
They enjoy the smell.

28:36.400 --> 28:40.400
This is healthy for the nerves and invigorating for the lungs.

28:40.400 --> 28:44.640
Everett this whole time has seemed unaffected by the whole situation is more confused than

28:44.640 --> 28:45.520
anything else.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.680
So are we, you know, where she is or we're going to get her.

28:47.920 --> 28:48.640
What's going on?

28:48.640 --> 28:50.320
Does anyone know?

28:50.320 --> 28:51.760
Thorough is standing up again.

28:52.320 --> 28:55.520
Does anyone know where she is?

28:56.080 --> 28:56.560
Everett?

28:56.560 --> 28:58.320
Where did you last see her?

28:58.320 --> 29:02.080
She is running off in the tree line of the past behind my house.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.200
I mean, south.

29:03.760 --> 29:04.480
How long ago?

29:06.320 --> 29:07.360
It was, it was last night.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.200
I think it was about two in the morning.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.240
I just made that up, Zach.

29:10.240 --> 29:12.080
I don't know if that matters the time.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.040
No, it was three in the morning.

29:15.040 --> 29:15.840
It was late at night.

29:15.840 --> 29:16.960
I didn't have my watch on me.

29:17.680 --> 29:23.280
Perhaps the judge would like to lead us in searching for her trail out by a tree line.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.880
Everybody roll spot hidden.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.280
62 on a 65.

29:33.280 --> 29:34.800
41 on a 45.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.440
76 on a 40 fail.

29:37.440 --> 29:39.760
I fail at 97 on a 45.

29:39.760 --> 29:41.760
I'm a dinosaur hunter.

29:41.760 --> 29:44.480
All I do is spot hidden bones.

29:45.760 --> 29:47.440
That's my character.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.600
Joe and Justin, take your headphones off.

29:58.240 --> 30:03.040
Professor Horace Green and Judge Ephraim Cortland.

30:03.600 --> 30:11.680
Around this time, you notice a man standing in one of the windows watching the proceedings

30:11.680 --> 30:12.320
take place.

30:13.040 --> 30:16.480
You recognize him immediately as Silas Cole.

30:16.480 --> 30:21.120
This man has made contention what it is today.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.720
He is the reason that the mine is profitable.

30:24.720 --> 30:29.280
He is the reason that there's electricity all throughout the entire town.

30:29.280 --> 30:35.600
He is the philanthropist making sure that children have education.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.720
Him and his wife, Mary.

30:37.520 --> 30:38.880
He's five foot eight.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.960
He's got messy, dirty blonde hair.

30:41.520 --> 30:48.000
His crooked yellow teeth and bright green eyes that are sunken in, but they're also

30:48.000 --> 30:50.240
bulging a little bit.

30:50.240 --> 30:56.080
And he's just paying very close attention to everything happening from a back window

30:56.080 --> 30:57.120
of the church.

30:57.120 --> 30:59.120
Uh, I run outside to go talk to him.

31:00.240 --> 31:04.720
I'm gonna come after him, follow, see what the professor's up to.

31:04.720 --> 31:10.400
Do I have time to talk briefly in private before the judge can ooze his way forward?

31:10.400 --> 31:11.760
Yeah, let's do a little contest.

31:13.280 --> 31:19.120
I believe there are some breakdowns in athletics in this game.

31:19.120 --> 31:19.840
And so...

31:22.400 --> 31:22.960
Oh, nope.

31:22.960 --> 31:23.840
There are not.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.440
I was completely wrong.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.680
How would you run fast in this game?

31:27.680 --> 31:29.680
Fast talk, but with your legs.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.600
Pilot your own self.

31:31.600 --> 31:31.920
Jump.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.680
It's like a video game where if you jump, fast.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.200
All right, we'll just use dexterity.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.520
So roll a dexterity contest against each other.

31:43.360 --> 31:43.760
Fail.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.200
49 on a 40.

31:45.200 --> 31:45.600
Fail.

31:45.600 --> 31:46.800
73 on a 60.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.880
Okay, so you're both going to make it out at the same time?

31:48.880 --> 31:50.480
Stumbling over each other.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.360
Yeah.

31:51.360 --> 31:59.040
With Courtland leaving, there's a breath of fresh air inside as you both kind of bail

31:59.040 --> 31:59.680
outside.

32:01.520 --> 32:07.680
Yes, now the smell of Judge Courtland has dissipated from his region.

32:08.560 --> 32:13.120
And you make it out there and you see that Silas Cole is this man.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.880
Just these massive eyes.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.800
He's holding a ladder.

32:16.800 --> 32:24.160
And right next to him, he has odd looking mechanical devices with some sort of like

32:24.160 --> 32:29.120
wooden planks going off from a middle point on his body.

32:29.120 --> 32:29.600
No, no, no.

32:29.600 --> 32:35.760
On the ground next to him, he's got like three or four of these devices, essentially,

32:35.760 --> 32:41.680
that have some sort of motor in the middle and then these planks coming off from them

32:41.680 --> 32:44.240
and around his shoulder like a lasso.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.000
He's got copper wiring.

32:47.680 --> 32:51.280
Oh, well, Ephraim, we might have solved your problem.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.200
He's wearing huge pants.

32:54.320 --> 32:59.600
So he's wearing both suspenders and a belt.

32:59.600 --> 33:02.400
Well, a chill runs down Thomas's spine.

33:02.400 --> 33:07.040
As any beans getting in the mix can only mean trouble.

33:07.040 --> 33:07.520
No, no, no.

33:07.520 --> 33:09.040
This is Silas Cole.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.240
I know, but clearly.

33:14.000 --> 33:24.240
Mr. Cole, as you may know, I'm Professor Horace Green, and I sometimes pay your men to bring

33:24.240 --> 33:27.440
me any fossils they might find in the mine.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.440
I'm concerned about...

33:30.560 --> 33:31.360
Why are you concerned?

33:33.120 --> 33:38.400
One of your employees, Thomas, a young man who would bring me fossils.

33:40.000 --> 33:45.920
I haven't been able to find him today, and he told me he had found something quite special.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.080
Have you heard anything about Thomas?

33:50.080 --> 33:51.680
Did anything happen to him in the mine?

33:53.360 --> 33:56.800
No, he's completely avoiding eye contact with you.

33:56.800 --> 34:00.480
His eyes are bugged out, looking at the ground, kind of looking at your feet.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.480
And then he looks straight up at you, and he's like,

34:03.280 --> 34:04.400
No, I don't...

34:05.280 --> 34:06.160
Looks back down.

34:06.160 --> 34:08.160
I don't know what you're talking about.

34:08.160 --> 34:10.160
Did you create these devices?

34:11.040 --> 34:11.540
Yeah.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.160
I'm something of a man of science myself.

34:14.160 --> 34:16.640
Could you explain the principle to me?

34:16.640 --> 34:17.280
It spins.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.840
I'll show you if we go inside, but did you...

34:23.360 --> 34:25.760
This Thomas fellow, what do you know about him?

34:26.640 --> 34:28.080
Well, I know he was a gambler.

34:28.240 --> 34:33.840
Uh, I'm worried someone might have hurt him for his gambling debts.

34:33.840 --> 34:34.960
Do you think that's why he's gone?

34:36.160 --> 34:37.360
It could be, Mr. Cole.

34:37.360 --> 34:38.960
Why do you think he's gone?

34:38.960 --> 34:41.600
Probably the same reason that you said just now.

34:41.600 --> 34:42.100
Indeed.

34:43.040 --> 34:47.760
In all candor, Mr. Cole, I had heard you were quarreling with Thomas

34:47.760 --> 34:49.680
the day before his disappearance.

34:49.680 --> 34:50.640
Interesting.

34:50.640 --> 34:52.320
What was that quarrel about?

34:52.320 --> 34:54.480
He was down, uh, he didn't do his job.

34:54.800 --> 35:01.600
And you see Ephraim's like just finished packing some chew into his lip,

35:01.600 --> 35:03.520
and he lights a hand-rolled cigarette.

35:04.080 --> 35:10.640
He walks over to Silas and just grabs the copper wire off his shoulder.

35:10.640 --> 35:15.760
Okay, so first off, I need psychology.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.200
Yeah, go ahead and roll psychology.

35:18.240 --> 35:19.600
Should have a points into that.

35:19.600 --> 35:21.360
A 90 on a 10.

35:21.360 --> 35:22.800
I got a lot of weird skills though.

35:23.440 --> 35:24.640
43 out of 10.

35:24.640 --> 35:28.720
Um, yeah, he wasn't, he wasn't doing his job right.

35:28.720 --> 35:31.280
We had words, I'm glad he's working for you,

35:31.280 --> 35:35.520
because he's not working for me now, obviously, because he's gone.

35:35.520 --> 35:39.840
And then Judge Ephraim grabs the copper wiring or goes to,

35:39.840 --> 35:45.280
and Silas Cole puts his opposite arm on the Judge's shoulder

35:45.280 --> 35:47.440
and looks straight up into his eyes.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
And you see these wild green bulging eyes looking at you.

35:52.800 --> 35:58.800
Are you sure that you want to do that unless you're helping me?

35:58.800 --> 36:02.080
Because it seemed like maybe you're not helping.

36:02.080 --> 36:08.240
Your lights, your lights stopped working because it looks like you took my copper wire.

36:08.240 --> 36:09.680
I would do no such thing.

36:10.240 --> 36:13.360
If your lights aren't working there in the courthouse,

36:13.360 --> 36:16.080
then I can get that working for you.

36:16.640 --> 36:19.040
But these are for the church currently.

36:19.600 --> 36:23.600
So please either help me carry them inside or release them.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.360
Okay, when can you get them to mine?

36:26.080 --> 36:27.840
I need it like now.

36:28.480 --> 36:31.280
I can't do any work in the dark.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.800
You're not there now.

36:33.600 --> 36:37.120
And so let's go inside the church first.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.920
Uh, Ephraim blows some smoke into his face,

36:39.920 --> 36:43.520
grabs the copper wire and heads back into the church.

36:43.520 --> 36:46.800
Horace Green, um, chews on his pipe a little bit

36:46.800 --> 36:49.840
and blows some smoke into the air and turns around and goes back into the church.

36:50.400 --> 36:54.000
And Silas Cole doesn't make a fucking move

36:54.000 --> 36:57.520
the entire time either one of those actions are taken.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.600
Let's bring the boys back.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.880
Courtland and Green, do you want to describe in order

37:11.440 --> 37:13.600
how you arrived back into the church?

37:13.680 --> 37:16.960
Ephraim walks into the church, smoking a cigarette,

37:18.480 --> 37:24.480
spits some chew spit on the ground and he's got copper wire over his shoulder

37:24.480 --> 37:29.600
and he just throws a copper wire onto the ground and just kind of stands there.

37:29.600 --> 37:34.560
Horace goes back to where he was sitting and opens up his book again,

37:34.560 --> 37:37.280
but it doesn't really look like he's reading it now.

37:37.280 --> 37:38.320
Cole's here.

37:38.320 --> 37:43.200
And as soon as Courtland, Judge Courtland says Cole's here,

37:43.760 --> 37:50.160
the doors bust open to the church and a skittish man looking at the ground in front of him

37:50.160 --> 37:55.280
kind of seeing the copper wiring on the ground immediately starts collecting it

37:55.280 --> 38:00.320
as he's pulling in these four odd contraptions you've never seen before.

38:00.320 --> 38:04.720
Some sort of motor in the middle and then wooden planks coming off from the sides.

38:04.800 --> 38:09.760
Silas Cole is five foot eight with messy dirty blonde hair.

38:09.760 --> 38:15.760
He's got crooked yellow teeth and these bright green eyes that are sunken in

38:15.760 --> 38:18.240
but also bulging at the same time.

38:18.800 --> 38:22.080
And he's wearing huge pants.

38:22.080 --> 38:25.360
He's got suspenders and a belt.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.080
Holy shit.

38:30.240 --> 38:30.720
Yeah, no.

38:31.120 --> 38:31.620
Yeah.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.720
Sorry, preacher there.

38:35.840 --> 38:36.320
You're good.

38:36.320 --> 38:36.880
Carry on.

38:36.880 --> 38:39.920
I'm just gonna go ahead and hook these up for y'all.

38:39.920 --> 38:42.400
It's pretty hot in here.

38:42.400 --> 38:46.400
And this is the new one and kind of like holds a thumbs up.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.240
Do we do this yet?

38:49.520 --> 38:50.320
You guys get this?

38:52.720 --> 38:53.920
Oh God, Zach.

38:53.920 --> 38:55.440
You really do need to watch Dark.

38:57.760 --> 38:58.640
I can't wait.

38:59.520 --> 39:00.480
You found your wire.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.080
No, he's got...

39:02.800 --> 39:07.440
He said he didn't steal mine, but he's gonna help fix it, I hope.

39:07.440 --> 39:10.640
Silas, do you know where Kitty is, Miss Kitty?

39:10.640 --> 39:15.360
Silas Cole has already set up a ladder in the middle of the aisle and is all the way up

39:15.360 --> 39:24.080
and is hooking up the very first ceiling fan that's ever existed here in the town of Contingent.

39:24.080 --> 39:25.840
And he looks down at you and he's like,

39:26.480 --> 39:30.400
I don't know who you're talking about.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.880
We're all here because of some missing people.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.360
Why didn't you come to the meeting?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.760
Maybe you know something about it.

39:37.760 --> 39:40.880
And Ephraim walks over to the ladder

39:41.440 --> 39:45.840
and puts a hand on it and kind of like menacingly looks up at Silas.

39:45.840 --> 39:48.400
I don't know anything about any missing people.

39:48.400 --> 39:57.600
I'm just here to provide circulating air for the entire townsfolk here while I have contention.

39:57.600 --> 39:58.960
Air's not good enough here.

40:01.680 --> 40:06.480
Being right above you, the smell is not pleasant.

40:07.120 --> 40:10.720
You hear a little harumph from Horace Green.

40:10.720 --> 40:15.840
Ephraim just keeps staring up at him and he finishes putting in the first ceiling fan,

40:16.560 --> 40:18.720
comes back down the ladder.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.400
Are you like right at the base?

40:20.400 --> 40:25.040
Like not to where he can't get down but where I'll be like right next to him when he gets down.

40:25.040 --> 40:30.880
And then yeah he just looks you dead in the eyes with these wild crazed green eyes

40:30.880 --> 40:33.840
and begins moving the ladder forward.

40:33.840 --> 40:40.000
He runs the wire through real quick and sets it up and the first fan starts going.

40:40.080 --> 40:47.680
And everyone in this room feels relief from this hot humid air for the first time.

40:47.680 --> 40:50.800
And as he begins setting up the second one he looks down.

40:52.160 --> 40:56.480
I don't think that the dearest appearances need to be looked into.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.200
Personally, good riddance.

40:59.200 --> 41:02.160
Contention's better off without those people.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.600
That's not for you to decide.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.840
That's literally my job.

41:05.840 --> 41:10.400
Well, it kind of seems like we're here at a town hall meeting

41:10.400 --> 41:14.160
to figure out what the next best move is.

41:15.200 --> 41:19.200
Bobby Custard takes control once again and is like,

41:19.200 --> 41:22.000
well yeah no that is about there they're right.

41:22.000 --> 41:28.000
And you know with all this air flowing down I feel like it's about time to take a vote.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.480
Oh shit that does feel pretty nice.

41:30.480 --> 41:33.680
Hey when you fix up my lights you need to put one of these in.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.920
Silas Cole looks at you.

41:36.640 --> 41:39.040
I can make that happen.

41:39.040 --> 41:40.480
We get to it then.

41:40.480 --> 41:44.240
So nobody's looking into these disappearances?

41:44.240 --> 41:46.880
I didn't even know about them until I showed up here.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.600
I'm more concerned with that so.

41:49.600 --> 41:53.360
Mr. Cole why don't you want us to look into these disappearances?

41:53.360 --> 41:54.560
Completely ignores you.

41:54.560 --> 41:59.440
And the crowd begins to continue to chatter and chatter and chatter

41:59.440 --> 42:06.240
until their voices rise up meeting yours and your voice is lost as you say Mr. Cole.

42:06.240 --> 42:09.040
Jack walks up to Bobby Custard.

42:09.680 --> 42:11.200
Is it Custer or Custer?

42:11.200 --> 42:12.880
Yep Bobby Custard.

42:12.880 --> 42:17.040
And he walks up to him he's like you better get control of this crowd now

42:17.040 --> 42:20.240
if you want anything to be done hand on shoulder.

42:20.240 --> 42:27.840
I mean I think looking up at Silas Cole who's putting up the final ceiling fan in the church.

42:28.400 --> 42:31.520
I I think we're good probably.

42:32.080 --> 42:35.440
You're gonna tell me one of us goes missing.

42:36.160 --> 42:39.680
A couple ceiling fans will do the trick you don't want to look for us.

42:39.680 --> 42:44.720
As I say that I'm gripping him ever so slightly more aggressively.

42:44.720 --> 42:45.520
Roll intimidate.

42:48.320 --> 42:49.840
Uh do not pass.

42:49.840 --> 42:55.760
Bobby just kind of like shirks off of you as Everett Pace approaches.

42:55.760 --> 42:59.600
Bobby I I don't know much about what's going on here but if there's a grave

42:59.600 --> 43:02.160
robber on the loose we're gonna have to stop that.

43:02.160 --> 43:05.200
They'll just keep coming night after night taking all the bodies.

43:05.200 --> 43:06.880
Horace is pushing his way up too.

43:07.840 --> 43:14.480
Sheriff I overheard a minor last night um saying that one of the disappeared had been

43:14.480 --> 43:15.680
arguing with Mr. Cole.

43:15.680 --> 43:19.280
Now I seem to think he's he's got an ulterior mold of fear.

43:19.280 --> 43:22.880
Don't just let these people disappear because he gave you some fans.

43:23.440 --> 43:26.480
Ephraim's looking up at the fans and then looks down and sees

43:26.480 --> 43:30.080
these three talking to Bobby and waddles over there.

43:30.080 --> 43:35.760
Now I I it's not that I'm not doing anything because there's fans here it's just that

43:35.760 --> 43:41.360
I'm not doing anything because people don't seem too upset except for maybe the three

43:41.360 --> 43:48.400
of you and if if we don't know where this person who clearly disappeared and then somehow

43:48.400 --> 43:49.440
came back.

43:49.440 --> 43:54.000
If we don't know where to go after her then I don't know what you expect me to do.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.640
Well it sounds to me like she's got something in the woods there.

43:56.640 --> 43:57.840
She had three bodies.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.600
She didn't have three bodies when I saw her.

43:59.600 --> 44:01.760
She dropped them off somewhere between here and there.

44:01.760 --> 44:03.680
We got to search around between here and there.

44:03.680 --> 44:07.520
And that's what Judge Courtland hears as he approaches.

44:07.520 --> 44:10.560
I forgot about this damn body sir.

44:11.360 --> 44:14.240
Sheriff what are you planning on doing about about that?

44:14.240 --> 44:16.960
Because you know you got to do your job so I can do mine.

44:18.560 --> 44:21.760
He looks over all of your shoulders at Silas Cole.

44:22.880 --> 44:26.320
Thanks Mr. Cole we certainly do appreciate it here.

44:26.320 --> 44:30.800
I I slap him like with my walking stick in the shin when he does that.

44:30.800 --> 44:40.880
Now I now I certainly don't want to step on any toes here of the man who essentially

44:40.880 --> 44:45.200
owns and runs this town if you guys catch my drift.

44:45.920 --> 44:53.040
But if you happen to have plans aka Mr. Pace going down to the woods trying to find a spot

44:53.040 --> 44:59.920
in between the two spots I'll certainly come with you if if you if you if you require my

44:59.920 --> 45:06.720
assistance but if we could keep it on the down low from Mr. Cole clearly I think that

45:06.720 --> 45:08.960
would be the best course of action.

45:08.960 --> 45:13.200
So maybe don't all stand around here all at the same time.

45:13.200 --> 45:14.320
I get it yeah.

45:14.320 --> 45:18.400
Jack turns around and just starts walking out puts his hat back on his head or whatever.

45:18.400 --> 45:23.520
Not all at once but let's pretend like we're dissatisfied and after Jack's gone away like

45:23.520 --> 45:27.600
a little bit then the professor turns around too and he's like he looks like he did not

45:27.600 --> 45:29.440
get what he wanted from the from the sheriff.

45:29.440 --> 45:35.920
No I I promise I'm doing my job y'all just need to you know calm down about the whole

45:35.920 --> 45:37.280
situation.

45:38.720 --> 45:43.040
Uh Ephraim looks at Everett and looks at Bobby he's like I don't see any reason to piss

45:43.040 --> 45:46.320
him off till I get one of them fans so uh yeah.

45:47.440 --> 45:54.400
And then I make a big show of spitting on Bobby's shoes and slowly turn around and

45:54.400 --> 45:55.120
walk off.

45:55.120 --> 45:57.520
Bobby looks directly at Everett Pace.

45:57.520 --> 46:01.040
He didn't have to he didn't have to spit on my shoes like that.

46:01.040 --> 46:10.720
Everett grabs the preacher by the shoulder and pulls him in real tight close to his ear.

46:11.760 --> 46:16.640
We're gonna find that grave robber and if something happens to Clara's grave before

46:16.640 --> 46:20.320
we do it's you that I'm blaming.

46:20.320 --> 46:21.520
And he starts walking away.

46:22.160 --> 46:22.560
Nice.

46:23.200 --> 46:23.600
Sick.

46:24.320 --> 46:24.880
Fuck yeah.

46:24.880 --> 46:25.920
What a creepo.

46:27.600 --> 46:29.280
Oh I love Everett Pace.

46:29.280 --> 46:31.200
What a horrifying creature.

46:31.200 --> 46:33.920
You guys all made dope characters.

46:33.920 --> 46:34.560
Big fan.

46:35.360 --> 46:37.680
Horrified of what you're capable of.

46:42.320 --> 46:46.800
As characters you're curious as to the the uh the thoughts.

46:47.360 --> 46:49.520
I think Everett is kind of on the surface right now.

46:49.520 --> 46:54.400
He's he's worried about his the grave on his property there and uh you know doesn't

46:54.400 --> 46:55.520
really know what's going on.

46:55.520 --> 46:59.200
He kind of removes himself from the town's affairs normally so

46:59.200 --> 47:01.440
it's just that this ended up on his doorstep.

47:01.440 --> 47:06.240
Horace typically wouldn't care to get involved either but he can't resist a conundrum.

47:06.240 --> 47:10.080
Courtland didn't expect to get wrapped into any of this he just wanted his

47:10.080 --> 47:14.880
lights on and but he he really does love stringing up a

47:14.880 --> 47:18.400
a criminal so he gets excited at the thought of catching one.

47:18.400 --> 47:22.560
Horrifying.

47:22.560 --> 47:27.600
Jack Pearlman probably was uh less invested before he got pissed off by

47:27.600 --> 47:30.960
Judge and Silas Cole kind of just being assholes.

47:31.600 --> 47:37.040
Which is funny because at first he was pissed off at the Judge for being an a jerk to Silas

47:37.040 --> 47:41.920
Cole and that he was way more pissed off at Silas Cole implying that they should do nothing.

47:42.560 --> 47:46.560
And it kind of lit a little fire underneath him as a citizen of contention.

47:46.560 --> 47:47.600
Under his little butt.

47:47.600 --> 47:49.920
Under his little hot buns.

47:49.920 --> 47:51.760
Under his tight little butt.

47:53.520 --> 47:58.640
So yeah he I think he would he's definitely he's a little on fire right now like he's like angry

47:58.640 --> 48:03.440
but it's trying to direct trying to direct it in a way to do something instead of just

48:03.440 --> 48:04.400
punching somebody.

48:04.400 --> 48:11.920
Maybe a change of pace for old Jack Pearlman.

48:11.920 --> 48:14.080
I love Everett Pace with all my heart.

48:14.880 --> 48:20.080
And uh I think Jack Pearlman and Everett Pace are gonna get fanfic'd together.

48:20.080 --> 48:21.360
I can predict it already.

48:22.720 --> 48:23.280
Ship him.

48:23.280 --> 48:24.000
Ship him.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.440
Yeah we're both you know we both are living alone on our.

48:29.440 --> 48:31.200
Your couple's name could be Jace.

48:32.000 --> 48:32.500
Oh.

48:33.680 --> 48:34.180
Jevret.

48:35.920 --> 48:37.040
Or Earlman.

48:40.400 --> 48:40.900
Pervert?

48:41.680 --> 48:42.240
There it is.

48:44.240 --> 48:44.880
Pervert.

48:47.120 --> 48:47.760
Nailed it.

48:47.760 --> 48:48.320
Nice.

48:48.320 --> 48:56.320
As the crowd dissipates from the church and heads to their respective daily goings-ons

48:57.040 --> 49:04.240
you see Silas Cole walking down south to the new mine where they've set up shop after the one

49:04.240 --> 49:08.160
a little bit west of there has finished up.

49:08.160 --> 49:10.480
Started a new dig site further south.

49:10.480 --> 49:19.600
And the four of you kind of reconvene with the sheriff, the preacher, Bobby Custard,

49:19.600 --> 49:22.480
and Professor Horace Green steps right up.

49:22.480 --> 49:26.560
So father sheriff when when do we go looking for for Miss Kitty?

49:26.560 --> 49:29.520
I mean are y'all free now?

49:30.160 --> 49:30.480
Yes.

49:31.040 --> 49:36.000
Since we have the daylight it seems like if she's out there robbing graves it seems like

49:36.000 --> 49:42.640
a scary time to maybe look for her now but you know by nightfall maybe we'll have a better

49:42.640 --> 49:47.600
sense of where she's heading and then we'll be able to catch her in the act if you will.

49:47.600 --> 49:54.080
Perhaps hopefully we see I feel like the daylight is the less scary time to look for the grave

49:54.080 --> 49:58.720
robber and we would like to find her before she commits the act again you know ideally.

49:58.720 --> 49:59.840
Is that not what I said?

50:01.360 --> 50:02.720
I don't think so.

50:02.720 --> 50:06.320
Okay you were very smart and I agree.

50:06.320 --> 50:06.800
Let's go.

50:08.000 --> 50:12.800
So if we if we were we gonna go look in the woods for her or?

50:12.800 --> 50:14.880
Well I tell you my place is right there.

50:14.880 --> 50:17.840
The cemetery is right there so let's go right there.

50:17.840 --> 50:21.520
And I point I just like drew a line between the two and pointed to the middle.

50:23.760 --> 50:29.600
Well if we're gonna look for her now I'm I'm okay with that has been a while since I

50:30.320 --> 50:34.080
uh left anything on Ruth and Cassie's graves so.

50:35.040 --> 50:37.360
He's gonna softball it in there like that?

50:37.360 --> 50:39.520
It's my wife and daughter.

50:39.520 --> 50:41.600
Fresh graves you say?

50:44.560 --> 50:51.120
I ain't got no tracking skills but I'll help maybe maybe not who can say.

50:51.120 --> 50:54.560
Oh oh tracking skills that's what we need anybody got any of those?

50:55.360 --> 50:58.080
I know but I can spot hidden things and I can

50:59.040 --> 51:02.400
navigate and I have a great understanding of the natural world.

51:02.400 --> 51:05.360
Ah the natural world that's something I know about too.

51:05.360 --> 51:06.160
Yeah me too.

51:07.840 --> 51:14.480
You know perhaps we need to dig or excavate uh to solve this grave robbing mystery I.

51:14.480 --> 51:17.200
Sheriff now you must uh surely be.

51:17.200 --> 51:21.680
I'm finding myself less and less knowledgeable about the natural world

51:21.760 --> 51:24.640
and more and more knowledgeable about tracking.

51:24.640 --> 51:26.160
That's what I was hoping you'd say.

51:28.960 --> 51:32.000
You you're uh you hunt quite a bit don't you Sheriff?

51:32.000 --> 51:36.480
You seem like you might join us on Midian Adventure here in the future.

51:36.480 --> 51:40.960
Of course it's his job to guide lost souls through the wilderness.

51:41.520 --> 51:44.000
Yeah we just decided that you're an expert tracker.

51:44.960 --> 51:49.120
And that nice raccoon that raccoon hat you're wearing you

51:49.120 --> 51:51.360
must have got that from tracking and trapping it.

51:51.760 --> 51:58.320
And he just pets it and then he makes a purring sound for it.

52:00.400 --> 52:01.840
I hate that I stopped doing that.

52:06.880 --> 52:08.880
I'll probably find an ending in there somewhere.

52:10.160 --> 52:18.000
Hey by the way Sheriff you got any new people I need to on the docket I should look at?

52:18.000 --> 52:20.880
I didn't have time because the the lights were off.

52:22.080 --> 52:24.160
No no the episode's over now okay.

52:26.160 --> 52:26.800
Stop it.

52:29.120 --> 52:30.000
Stop rolling with it.

52:30.000 --> 52:30.640
I'm off the clock.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.280
I said I met that acting.

52:34.080 --> 52:35.280
We normally don't do outros.

52:35.840 --> 52:43.440
That that that this was episode 91 of pretending to be people.

52:43.440 --> 52:46.000
Oh yes yes y'all come back now you hear?

52:51.680 --> 53:13.840

53:22.460 --> 53:24.820

53:24.820 --> 53:27.500

🎶 Can't you hear the wolves howling 🎶

53:35.160 --> 53:37.440
