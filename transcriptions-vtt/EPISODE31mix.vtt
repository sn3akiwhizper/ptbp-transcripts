00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Welcome one and all to Contentions best radio station that is currently hijacking the radio waves of the city.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
And now I am hearing that we are also the city's best radio station as well.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.500
Well would you look at that y'all.

00:16.500 --> 00:20.500
This is your radio pirate ship captain Wolf the dog.

00:20.500 --> 00:28.000
And I'm here to steer all y'all's doubloons so I can buy myself a mini fridge for my new apartment here in the city.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from NZO.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.000

00:47.500 --> 00:50.000
NZO writes,

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Hey Mr. Dog, how you doin'?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
I feel like nobody asks you that.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
I would like to send a shout out to my lovely second half, Ryanna.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
She really isn't big into tabletop games, but the moment she heard this gem of a show, she was all ears.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
And she thinks everyone is doing a terrific job.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
Just wanted to tell her thanks for being my number one, even when I can be a real number two.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I guess that's really it.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
So I will re-ask my initial question. How you doin'?

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
You know, I've been alright, can't complain.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
Rent here in the city is a little nuts compared to the old basement back in contention.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
But otherwise, everything has been okay, I guess.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
I do miss the rats back in the basement sometimes.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
Those tasty, delicious little morsels of meat.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Mmmm.

01:47.000 --> 01:55.000
Anyway, as I've been getting settled into my new place here in the city, I have fallen behind on the latest happenings.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
So here is an exceptionally intimate version of the news.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
The other day, I was walking my dog, Wolf.

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
And we ran into a little old homeless lady pup getting a nice little snack at a dumpster that I frequent.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
Now this little old lady dog took a liking to my dog, Wolf.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
And y'all, it looks like my little old boy has fallen for a city girl.

02:20.000 --> 02:27.000
Or it could have been the fact that she was covered in ranch dressin' that was getting my boy all riled up for love.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Who can say?

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
Please remember, my friends, we got ourselves a Patreon now.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
The link is in the show notes.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
And if you can't support us financially, please tell a friend about the show.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
And if you don't have any friends, please write a review on iTunes.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
And if you can't use iTunes, post about the show on Reddit.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
But no matter who you are, turn up the volume and clap on the three and four.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
It's kudzu with no backbone.

03:14.000 --> 03:28.000
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
It's been a while.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
It's been a while.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Been a while.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
But it has been a while since I've said sorry.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
I'm realizing now.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
You can say it to me now if you want.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Okay.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Clark.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Oh, fuck.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
I mean, Joe.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
See, I'm already here.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
I'm already ready to go.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Already there.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I'm already rearing to go, baby.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
In situ.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
We have another special guest with us this week, and it is Taylor.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Hi.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
You've met me.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I'm Taylor.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Taylor, are you having a summer?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Oh, you know I'm having a summer.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
If you haven't seen that video, go watch Have a Summer by...

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Howard Kramer.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Do he and Kulop still do that one podcast they did?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
He still does it.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I think it's called Who Charted.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Yeah, that's it.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
But she's not on it anymore.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Gotcha.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
She got busy.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
She started writing and producing and all that.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Yeah.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Taylor, do you have anything to plug this week?

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I'd like to plug my career.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Go be a teacher and mold young minds.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Do the teach.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
It's the only way we move forward.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Do you like the smell of pubic hair and having your eyes rolled?

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Wait, what?

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
The smell of pubic hair?

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Wait, what?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Armpit hair.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
She is currently lifting up her arm and pointing at her armpit.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Your pubic hair.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
I can't wait for this to be cut later.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
There's not a chance this will be cut.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
No, I don't.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
This is absolutely staying in.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
I think there's a rule against me talking about my students' pubic hair.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah, I was about to say, we might be in legal territory at that point.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I really like my job.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Well, at least you've been armpit hair.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Let's jump.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
I love that.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
You should be a teacher.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
If you like the smell of pubic hair, you should be a teacher.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
And don't we all?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Take a look deep within yourselves.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
That's cool, yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
You could also become a priest.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
All right, so let's dive into the episode this week.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Clark.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
A thick fog obfuscates your vision.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
It's heavy.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
The air, like gravity, is somehow stronger than usual.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
A whisper in your ear sends shivers down inside your spine.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
The voice is familiar.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
A stainless steel door appears in front of you,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
opening so near your nose you feel a drop in temperature

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
as the cold metal swings by.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
A woman begins screaming behind you.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
And when you turn around, you see the face of Tildi B. Mitchell

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
on a television screen.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
She begins repeating herself over and over.

06:02.000 --> 06:11.000
Bonus round, bonus round, bonus, bonus round, bonus round, bonus round.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
And then you are running down the street.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
You recognize this street.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
You live up here on the left.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
A familiar boy is about to walk into the house.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
You begin to scream, and you are surrounded by this thick fog.

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
Your screams begin to echo infinitely into the sheer endlessness engulfing you.

06:31.000 --> 06:40.000
And then you hear a voice, and you look up, and you see,

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
well, Taylor, why don't you tell us what Clark sees?

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
Clark is about to see his one life mentor, a one Gerald Fingerson,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
in front of him.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
And how is he looking these days?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Handsome as ever, I say.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Handsome as ever.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Reiterated.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
What's he wearing?

06:59.000 --> 07:06.000
Well, I wanted that experience to be just between me and Clark.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Gerald and Clark.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
What he's wearing?

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Mm-hmm.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Okay, so the listeners aren't allowed to know?

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
He's a little bit older, as is Clark.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
But Gerald, he's one who ages so gracefully that it almost looks like he's younger.

07:24.000 --> 07:33.000
He has lost a little bit of his hair, but he's like the most handsome, balding, old librarian you've ever seen.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Does he still have those tats?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
He never talked about tats, did he?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Yeah, he had tats all down his arm.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I think he was wearing a-

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Secret tats?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
He was wearing a sweater vest.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
He was wearing a sweater vest with-

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Oh, did we make some-

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Mm-hmm.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
He was wearing a sweater vest with no shirt underneath.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
And I foisted upon you that he had tattoos beneath.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Mr. Rogers.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Anyway, he's looking good.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Mr. Finkerson ain't looking tight.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
That's how you speak now?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
That's Clark's new character voice.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Gerald is very disappointed.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
And Taylor, on this crisp December morning, Clark Bishop is wearing his underwear.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
What kind of underwear does Clark wear?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Tighty-whities.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Yeah, yeah, non-stop.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
And he is also wearing a t-shirt from a gas station called Pump and Dump.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Good.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Woo-hoo.

08:20.000 --> 08:28.000
Now, Clark, when you look down and see that, you realize that you are also not wearing any shoes or socks.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
And it's like December 6th, and it is quite cold outside.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
It's strange because you feel absolutely incredible.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
The past few days have been exhausting and non-stop.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
But you feel better than you felt in a very long time.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
So I'm going to need you to take your hit points and willpower all the way back up to full.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Holy shit.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Which takes you to what?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
My hit points go up to 26.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
That's my max.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
And willpower, you said?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Willpower as well.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
That brings me up to 12 is my max.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Congratulations.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
You feel unstoppable.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Woo.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

09:09.000 --> 09:18.000
And Clark, around your wrist is a string that's attached to a bag of ice with a metal rod sticking out of the top.

09:18.000 --> 09:26.000
And this bag of ice is leaking red down the driveway the two of you are standing on.

09:26.000 --> 09:34.000
The suburban home this driveway belongs to looks exactly like all the other homes on this street with one key distinction.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
The mailbox says Jim Cook.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh shit.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
So you're standing there.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
You've got this string around your wrist, bag of ice connected to it.

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
Bag of ice is leaking red down the driveway, metal rod kind of sticking up out.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
And you notice that there's also like a little, there's something else in the bag of ice.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Where's Mr. Fingersen situated in the world?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
He's just sitting.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
He's holding your hand.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Yeah, he's holding your hand.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Mr. Fingersen?

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
My dear boy, you look a little different than I saw you last.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
Where are we? How'd I get here?

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
Boy, we've been here for 40 years.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I'm only 37, Mr. Fingersen.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
I know. I like to joke with you, my boy.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I thought that was our little banter.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
We walked here from the park. Don't you remember?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
I don't, Mr. Fingersen.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
What do you remember, my boy?

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
I remember a room and there were cages and I fought, I fought, I fought, I fought a kid.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
And then I saw my partners and they were, they were shooting and fell in the crowd and they were...

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
And did you save them, boy?

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
I don't, I don't know. I don't know.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
What do you suppose we shall do now?

10:50.000 --> 10:57.000
I pull the ice bag toward myself. Can I open it without, without losing any contents?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
I peek in. What do I see?

10:59.000 --> 11:07.000
Peeking in, you see this metal rod goes down into the bottom of the ice bag and it is surrounded by ice.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
So you just got the top of the rod, just the tip.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
Up against like the side of the bag on the inside, up against some ice, there is a small canvas bag.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
So is the metal rod just a metal rod? Is there any markings on it or anything?

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
It doesn't look like it. Go ahead and roll intelligence for me real quick.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Oh boy, it's a roll. It's the first roll in a while.

11:29.000 --> 11:39.000
Now for the listeners, I, I failed to call for rolls quite often in these last two little mini sessions with the other two boys.

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
And by mini sessions, I mean full episodes as how they turned out. And...

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
So he's going to give me a lot of rolls with a lot of chances of failure.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Setting Clark up for failure is what I do best.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
That one I passed on though. I got a 10 on a 55.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
Congratulations, Sue. When you look at this rod, you flash back to being in that cage.

12:01.000 --> 12:09.000
And you recognize this metal rod that's shoved inside this bag of ice is from the cage that you were in.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
It was one of the bars that was on the cage.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
And I'm, and I'm tied to the bag?

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
You just have a string around your wrist. It's just, it's not tied to you necessarily,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
but you know, the string at the top of a bag of ice, like a little rope thing.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Got it, got it, got it.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Your hand is just kind of through it.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Like the drawstring?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Yeah, exactly.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
You said it's dripping red, like presumably blood?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Presumably.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Mr. Fingersen, does this, does this look like blood to you?

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
My boy, I've only seen blood once in my life, but it does appear that way.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
I lift up my shirt and I'm looking for scars on myself and I'm turning around and it's like,

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Mr. Fingersen, is there anything on my back? Am I hurt?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
You look amazing.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
As you lift your shirt up, you lift it right above your chest.

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
You see right, almost in the middle of your chest, but just a little bit off stage left,

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
there is a gaping hole that goes all the way through you.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Do you see anything, Mr. Fingersen?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Nothing too out of the ordinary.

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000
Perhaps that donut hole in the middle of you could have be filled in with some cluck.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Go ahead and roll sanity for me real quick.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
It hurts right here.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
Not so much here, not so much here, but right here.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
A 51 on, you said sanity roll, currently is 26.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
That's a failure.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
All right.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Yeah, I would say a hole running through your body.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
You feel fine, but you're going to take half a D6 of sanity loss on that.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Oh, shit.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
You know, because there's a hole through your body.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
I rolled a five.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Okay, that's three.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
You lose three sanity taking you down to?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
23.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Woo!

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
My breaking point is 18.

13:50.000 --> 13:57.000
So as you look at your chest, you see that the skin actually moves from each side of

13:57.000 --> 14:07.000
the hole down into your body and creates this gelatinous cartilage walled tunnel that runs

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
through you.

14:08.000 --> 14:15.000
And you can actually put your fingers in and as you press in to the skin that is technically

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
inside of you, but is not because it's a tunnel.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
So it's outside of you still somehow.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
It just feels like an ear, you know, or like a nose.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
It's just that that cartilage kind of hard lumpy.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
That skin covering it all?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Skin's covering it all.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Cluck, are you in pain?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
It doesn't hurt.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
It's like my body got a gauge, you know, like in your ears.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Yes.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
It seems you've become quite a badass.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
It's pretty cool.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
You want to touch it?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Not particularly.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
I try to not touch anymore.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
That's probably good life advice.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Perhaps we should go inside.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
I was actually just on my way to go see my dear friend Jim.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
We have cashew chicken on Sundays together.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Jim.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Jim Cook.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Yes, of course.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Why are you here?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Mr. Fingers.

15:04.000 --> 15:12.000
And I don't know why I'm here, but we found out earlier in the week that Jim Jim's dead.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Well, that can't be.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Jim is my dearest friend.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
Once you stopped visiting me at the library is the only one I had left.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, Mr.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Fingers.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
But we get it on good authority that he was found dead in an alley.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Okay, well.

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
At precisely this moment you notice that there is a man walking swiftly toward you.

15:39.000 --> 15:47.000
And he is wearing one of those full windbreaker outfits that's like purple and green and black and white.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
And like straight out of the 80s.

15:50.000 --> 15:58.000
And he is walking quite briskly and he's got these little goggles on that seem to make him more wind resistant.

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
And as he approaches you he flips the goggles up onto his forehead.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Hey fella.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Hey.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Hey.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Hey fella.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
What can we do you for here?

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
You seem to be maybe a bit out of place.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
What's going on here?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Do I recognize this person at all?

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Not even a little bit.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I like your aesthetic.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
I certainly do appreciate you saying that sir.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
But I'm far more concerned about what you're maybe doing out here on this property.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Oh god.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
And he looks down and he sees the red going down the driveway and he's like, what?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Oh god.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
What happened there?

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
That's no good.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
It's a jello experiment is what Mr. Fingerson told me.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Oh a jello.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Who's Mr. Fingerson?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
This year Mr. Fingerson.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Oh that's me young man.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
And you are sir?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Oh I'm Ken.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
It's good to meet you Ken.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
It's good to meet you as well.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
And your name was?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Clark Bishop.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Clark Bishop.

16:55.000 --> 17:01.000
And he pulls out his phone and he types and he says Clark Bishop.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Okay that is, you know what?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
That is good information.

17:05.000 --> 17:14.000
So basically what we have here is you Clark Bishop not necessarily belonging in this neighborhood.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Would Clark know where Jim's house is?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Jim Cook's house is?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Just from his, are we in contention?

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
Oh no you would know that Jim Cook lives in the city.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Gotcha.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Suburbs.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Now sir you will not talk to my son that way.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
Now we will be on our way and you can go do some more briskie boys.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
The man Ken, his eyes get real wide and he backs up.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Okay you know what?

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
I think I better just go then.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
I guess have a good day.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Alright okay then.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
And he puts his goggles, he flips them right back down onto his eyes and he bails.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
He briskly walks.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
That was exhilarating.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
I've never talked to someone so harshly before.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
You were on your toes though Mr. Fingers and thanks.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
You know I've been doing extra wrist curls recently.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
It must have shown in my muscles.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
He was intimidated I'm sure.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Yes.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
Now I have had a hard time processing what you've said about Jim but you know what I

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
always say about a good researcher.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
If you don't see something first hand how could you possibly believe?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Let's go inside.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
I think getting off the street either way is a good idea.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Let's see if the door is open.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Mr. Fingerson?

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
Mr. Fingerson did you just happen upon me here in the driveway?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
How'd you find me?

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
It seems like me a coincidence.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
I don't know why you're here boy.

18:37.000 --> 18:45.000
So let's go ahead and as we watch Clark Bishop and Gerald Fingerson walk toward the house

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
let's go ahead and talk about the changes in Clark Bishop as a character.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
So you died.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
I died.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I had a great fall.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
And you spent 30 luck?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Yeah I spent 30 luck to avoid death.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
So how much luck are you at now?

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
That puts me at 45 according to my sheet here.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
45 luck.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Alright.

19:05.000 --> 19:12.000
Basically as I explained in the last episode I have given each of these boys two talents

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
from the Pulp Cthulhu rulebook and Clark chose...

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I chose one of them called Endurance.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
Oh yeah so that's a Constitution bump so...

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
I'm heartier.

19:25.000 --> 19:32.000
Much heartier at a time such as this and actually how we're going to do that in this game is

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
I'm going to give you a plus 40 on your Constitution.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
So what was your Constitution before?

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
My Constitution was 65.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
So now it is 105.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Nice.

19:42.000 --> 19:49.000
So on a Constitution check you will still be able to crit fail on a 100.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
Past that it's going to be all successes unless you're disadvantaged in some way.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Super cool.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Super duper cool.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
And then you chose another one as well.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
I chose Quickdraw which essentially makes it so that I am faster to a fight.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
In jargon it gives me a higher initiative roll.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
Yeah so typically I think in Pulp Cthulhu it boosts your initiative roll but here in

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
Delta Green we don't actually roll initiative unless it seems like a fun thing for me to

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
do at the time.

20:20.000 --> 20:26.000
So what we are going to do for Quickdraw is put Clark at the top of the order in every

20:26.000 --> 20:34.000
combat scenario and I'm going to let you spend 10 luck to act twice at the top if you would

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
like to.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Oh wow.

20:36.000 --> 20:43.000
Now I believe yesterday in world Clark Bishop hit a breaking point and the last breaking

20:43.000 --> 20:49.000
point that you hit we had discussed Clark Bishop needing to express his anger through

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
violence on a daily basis otherwise he would wake up the next day with a reduced amount

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
of willpower.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
We are going to go ahead and take that idea and push it to excess.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
So what's going to happen is every time you roll a sanity and you fail but that roll would

21:05.000 --> 21:12.000
also fail power so if I ask for a sanity roll if you fail that roll but you also fail

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
power which what's your power at?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
60.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
60 so if you roll over 60 on a sanity check not only are you going to lose that sanity

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
but you're also going to immediately lash out physically.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Ooh that's awesome.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
So glad I'm the only one around here.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
Yeah and that he said he was going to make me roll a bunch.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Exchange.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Get your things in order Gerald Fingersen.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
I'm always ready.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
For the grave.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
That's rude.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Just cause I'm old doesn't mean I'm near the grave.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
I'm a sprightly 67 now I'm probably like 80.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
I think you said you were 19 in the last one.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
I'm funny.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
I wrote sanity over 60 equals bad on the side of my character sheet.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
So that's going to be something that I think would be fun if we didn't talk about at the

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
table and you just do as a character.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Okay.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
I will say like and Joe did that sanity roll also fail on power and if so then I'm not

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
going to say okay then I'll take control of your character or anything like that.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
I'll just do it.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yeah just go for it.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Okay.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
And get weird with it.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
I love it.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Love it love it.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
Do I have to inflict harm or can I lash out in other ways?

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
I would say lashing out at a being of some sort would be unnecessary.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Okay.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
Sorry this sounded maybe like I said unnecessary.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I'm physically to a being necessary.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Oh he can't just like verbally berate me.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
He has to hit my face.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Yeah that makes sense.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I don't know.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
I'm a librarian.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
The power of words is more powerful than the power of fists.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Yeah I mean yeah you can think that.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
You've been doing those wrist curls though you'll be alright.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
You're right.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
You're right.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
I'm ready.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
Come at me young boy.

22:58.000 --> 23:05.000
Checking the front door of Jim Cook's house Clark feels the knob just open right up and

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
the door swings open.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Let's go in my boy.

23:07.000 --> 23:15.000
As you walk into this house the house smells kind of old but in a calming familiar way

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
and there's an upright piano in the entryway.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
The living room has papers and binders strewn all over the coffee table, couch, chairs,

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
the floor.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
Really everywhere in the living room there's just papers and binders and papers and binders

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
and the sun still low in the sky because it's early morning is shining in through the window

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
illuminating a fair amount of stagnant dust that is just hanging there.

23:40.000 --> 23:47.000
I was thinking about a way that we could investigate this house in a fun way and came up with a

23:48.000 --> 23:55.000
kind of new idea that we've never done before so I'm going to have Taylor and Joe fill out

23:55.000 --> 24:02.000
a quick form off mic and it's going to be of the mad gab style.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Persuasion.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
What's mad gab again?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Is that the fill in the adjective, the noun?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Yeah.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Okay cool.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Stoked.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
We'll be right back.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Holy shit cool.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Well it seems like Jim's dead.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
Would you like to hear me play Mary Had a Little Lamb?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
It was his favorite song.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
Yeah sure sure sure Mr. Fingers.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
Ding dong ding dong ding ding dong.

24:33.000 --> 24:39.000
I make my way toward where I think a bedroom might be and want to find some pants.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
You immediately find some pants that are sitting out on the bed.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Are they anywhere close to my size?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Go ahead and roll luck for me.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Uh oh.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
That's a critical fail.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
A 55 on a 45.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Oh.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Geralt hides in the closet.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
What could we put in Clark's...

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
No no no.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Not a sainted hero.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Oh right right.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
So Geralt hides in the closet.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Geralt goes home.

25:07.000 --> 25:15.000
Looking at these pants they're actually, they are quite tight as you put them on and as

25:15.000 --> 25:23.000
you pull them on they grab onto your leg hairs and pull up and they are basically capris

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
on you.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah totally.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
So now you are wearing capris, no shoes, no socks, and a shirt from...

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Pump and Dump.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
That is correct yes the Pump and Dump.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Yeah I'm looking real swell.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Yeah just nailing it.

25:37.000 --> 25:44.000
So as we said before I wanted to do the investigation of this house very odd and quick moving.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
To basically lay out the information for you and let you do with it what you will.

25:51.000 --> 25:58.000
Basically all of these solo episodes are meant to get the three boys back where they might

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
need to be.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
The boys are back in contention.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
The boys are back in contention.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Exactly.

26:04.000 --> 26:10.000
So Clark you begin looking floppily around the house.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
And on the fridge you see a picture that catches your attention.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
It's a picture of your parents.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
They are posing with silly hats and another man who is begrudgingly smiling.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Have I seen the picture before in my life?

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
You've never seen this picture before in your life.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
Do I know who that third man is or the third person?

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Jim.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
You would recognize him from some of the other pictures you've seen in this house.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
It is Jim Cook.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
It's old Jimmy boy.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
In my little notebook I was writing Jimmy boy.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
It's good to take thorough notes.

26:45.000 --> 26:53.000
Serendipitously scouring for more information you see a chest cavity of drawers.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
The cavity was a joke to you.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
You could have just said chest of drawers.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Chest of drawers and open it.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
Inside is a ziplock bag containing two small items.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
A single tarot card.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
It's the devil with several bullet holes in it.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Wow.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
And a taxidermied baby squirrel.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Baby squirrel.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Is there anything with the squirrel?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
There is nothing with the squirrel.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Can I look at the bottom of its base?

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Does it have any signature?

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
Do taxidermists put a signature on their taxidermied?

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Of course Zach.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Of course they do Zach.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
You know that Joe is from a long lineage of taxidermists.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Taxidermists.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
It's in his blood.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
I would say probably not.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
But maybe there's one there.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
All of that is in a ziplock bag?

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
The tarot card alongside the squirrel?

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Yeah.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
It's a taxidermied baby squirrel.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
It's a sandwich size bag.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
So the baby squirrel.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
The squirrel baby is the devil.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
Canonically Clark is a fan of taxidermy?

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
I believe he is.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Can he tell the craftsmanship?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Is it Julie Maxwell's craftsmanship?

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
Go ahead and roll intelligence for me.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
That is a pass.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Oh shit.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Fuck.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
It's not a pass.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Don't lie.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
It's a 56 on a 55.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
He can't see you.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Never lie to me.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
I will know.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I lie to Zach all the time.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
It's our special little game.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
It's what keeps our marriage healthy is secrets.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
That's a good foundation.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Summer secrets.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Oh you know I'm having a summer.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
You cannot tell the origin of this taxidermied squirrel.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
However, as you continue to blindly search for more,

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
you look behind the couch and hiding behind there,

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
you can see a leather holster for a firearm.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
There isn't a gun, but there is a small bit of text

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
tooled into the leather.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Tooled into the leather.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Tooled into the leather.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Tooled into the leather?

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Tooled into the leather.

28:59.000 --> 29:13.000
It says Scientia Mors Est, which is S-C-I-E-N-T-I-A space M-O-R-S space E-S-T space.

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
And then underneath it, it has a dash and then the letter uppercase K.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
And that's in the leather on the holster.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
It is indeed.

29:21.000 --> 29:27.000
And this one really made me happy with the way that the mad gab worked out.

29:27.000 --> 29:35.000
Stupidly going through his bathroom, you find a ring in a pile of abandoned pubic hair.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Thank you Taylor.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
It is smooth and silver with a little plateau on top.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
It is completely smooth with no markings on it whatsoever.

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
When you say a plateau on top, it's presumably like the base of where something would sit maybe?

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
It doesn't look like it. It looks like it's just rounded right up to the top

29:54.000 --> 30:00.000
and then where it would be on the top of your finger, it is just a flat plateau.

30:00.000 --> 30:08.000
Moving throughout the rest of the house, you see that in the living room with all the papers and binders and stuff all over the place,

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
you see two notebooks that are sitting out.

30:11.000 --> 30:18.000
One is leather and thick and it has a symbol on the front you have come to recognize.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
It has a big circle surrounded by six smaller circles.

30:23.000 --> 30:28.000
The other notebook is thin and red and it looks familiar.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Oh.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Go ahead and roll Luck for me.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
That's a pass. That's a 35 on a 45.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Alright.

30:35.000 --> 30:42.000
Walking over, you take a look at this thick leather book and it has this girthy wooden bookmark.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
Girthy.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Girthy wooden bookmark.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Girthy.

30:47.000 --> 31:00.000
And as you open it, it takes you to nearly the back of the book and written over and over on this ancient parchment is the phrase,

31:00.000 --> 31:10.000
it is only through death that he may rise again and death is capitalized and he is capitalized.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
Can I flip forward in the book some and see is it all handwritten or is some of it printed?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
It's actually weird.

31:17.000 --> 31:24.000
So before you can flip the book at all, drawn over this obsessive scroll,

31:24.000 --> 31:31.000
like drawn over it is a picture of a hooded figure with a brilliant light shining from its maw.

31:31.000 --> 31:40.000
So all the text is in the background and in the foreground is this hooded figure with this big light where its mouth is.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
It's drawn though. It's not an actual light emitting from the book, is it?

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
It's not, no.

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
But as you try to flip the book toward the front, go ahead and roll luck for me.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
That's a critical success. 33 on a 45.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
Oh my God. That is incredible.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
All the secrets of the universe are revealed to you in an instant.

32:05.000 --> 32:11.000
So as you flip this, as you flip this, yeah, I wasn't planning on giving you this.

32:12.000 --> 32:19.000
As you flip the book back through, you see there's a note stuck in it in between these two pages

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
and it kind of flits out as you go through the book and the book closes immediately.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
It almost unnaturally, so you can't get to any of the other pages,

32:29.000 --> 32:39.000
but this little piece of paper flips out this envelope and inside the envelope is a letter, a handwritten letter.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
You can see very clearly at the bottom it's signed by Jim Cook.

32:43.000 --> 32:50.000
In this letter, Jim Cook refutes, quote, the revelation of the overseer,

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
calling it the, quote, scratches of a broken man.

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
The letter then goes on to outline new guidelines,

33:00.000 --> 33:07.000
including the immediate reassignment of all members of the disposal unit.

33:08.000 --> 33:13.000
So A is the envelope addressed and B is the, is there a greeting to anybody at the top?

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
So at the top of this letter, it actually has the logo, the logo,

33:18.000 --> 33:23.000
the symbol with the circle surrounded by the six circles and it says,

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Nice.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I need you to roll luck for me.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
A fail. 75 on a 45.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
And with that, you hear the hammer of a gun click.

33:40.000 --> 33:48.000
Oh no. I got my hands up, but still, I guess, carrying the bag with the rod.

33:49.000 --> 33:55.000
Hands up, wearing your capris and your shirt from a gas station,

33:55.000 --> 34:01.000
hands up, holding up this bag of ice that is still dripping faster and faster red,

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
just all over this house, just red everywhere.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
We should investigate that.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Yeah, I should look into that bag a little more.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
Capri pants, first priority, second priority, blood bag.

34:16.000 --> 34:23.000
Clark, what the fuck are you doing in my daddy's house?

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
And it is chief Maggie Cook.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Oh my God.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
Margaret, do not talk to my adopted son that way.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
He's the only thing in my life.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Maggie, is it you?

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
Clark is, he might be crying.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
He might have a tear running down his eye right now and his hands are lowering.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
Is her gun lowering?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Her gun is lowering as your hands lower.

34:52.000 --> 34:58.000
Gerald is half standing in front of him because he doesn't actually want to die,

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
but he wants to show allegiance towards Gerald in this situation.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
I mean, I'm sorry, towards Clark in this situation.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Absolutely.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Well, in himself.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Actually, that was an accurate statement both ways.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Maggie, I don't, I'm sorry, chief.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
You can just call me Maggie now.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
Clark starts to compose himself a little more, stands up a little straighter,

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
but still is so slack-jawed.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
Maggie, I thought you died.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
I thought you were dead, Maggie.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
Yeah, I'm pretty confused here as well.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
I start walking toward her and I'm trying to hug her.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
Okay.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
Gerald continues to like put himself in between the two,

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
so he's sort of like shuffle-stepping forward.

35:37.000 --> 35:43.000
She awkwardly walks toward you and engages in one of the more awkward hugs

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
that's existed on this show.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Sandwich hug.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
And Gerald has never felt so much warmth and love in his life.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
You've got one arm in between us.

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
No, I mean, half my frail body is in there, too.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
It's the size of one arm, though.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
I pull away from the embrace.

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
Maggie, I swear to God, Joe doesn't remember.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Did I see her body?

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Did I ever see her body?

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
Maybe you would have seen the charred remains.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Let's say I did.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Maggie, I saw your body.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
You were dead, and saying that out loud freaks Clark out a little bit,

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
so he recoils and gets a little further away from her.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
This is just like an Edgar Allen Poe poem.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Chief Maggie Cook.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Well, just Maggie Cook.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
She's not wearing her uniform,

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
and this is maybe the first time you've seen her not in uniform in years.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Yeah.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
And now you only saw, I mean, you saw her five days ago.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
You were celebrating her birthday, but since then you've already mourned her.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
But she's just wearing like black jeans and a hoodie,

36:46.000 --> 36:51.000
and she kind of walks toward you and walks kind of past you a little bit

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
and grabs the red notebook that was sitting out.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
She kind of thumps it on one of her hands.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
Clark, have you been looking around here?

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
What did you come here for?

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Do I remember what color Drew gave her?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Drew gave her a yellow one, I believe.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
Maggie, I'll be honest.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
I'm missing, I've got some gaps.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
I actually don't know how I ended up here at this moment.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Mm-hmm.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Mm-hmm.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
And she pulls her finger out, and she kind of reaches towards you,

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
and she pokes at your chest and feels it give.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Hmm, what happened there?

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
I don't, I don't, I don't know, Maggie.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
I lift up my shirt and show her.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
She steps back.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Okay.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
All right.

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
Clark, I've been waiting a long time for this.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
I've been waiting a real long time for this.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
You need to come with me immediately.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
What's her demeanor?

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
Excited.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Happy or afraid?

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Both.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Has she acknowledged Mr. Fingersen at all?

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
No.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Which I find very rude.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Uh, fuck.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Where, uh, okay, where is she motioning toward?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Like, when she said come with me?

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Was she walking out of the house or somewhere else into the house?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
No, she was just standing.

38:03.000 --> 38:08.000
Uh, Maggie, uh, I mean, where, where do you, where have you been, Maggie?

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Clark.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Clark.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Now wait just one second.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
You won't tell us what to do.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Clark, what should we do?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Clark, is everything okay?

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Oh, shit.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
You know Maggie always was a bitch.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
She's ignoring me right now.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Don't listen to her.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Mr. Fingersen.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Yes?

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Stop for a second.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
Clark.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
I don't know about this, Maggie.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
I don't trust her.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Listen to me.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
I point at Mr. Fingersen.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
I'm talking to Mr. Fingersen, Maggie.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
And she takes a couple more steps back.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Okay, Clark.

38:41.000 --> 38:47.000
I think she's ignoring me just because one time I charged her extra for a late book.

38:47.000 --> 38:52.000
She wouldn't acknowledge that she didn't turn back in because of Winn-Dixie.

38:52.000 --> 38:57.000
I am staring very scared at Mr. Fingersen right now, and I turn back to Maggie.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Clark.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Yeah, Maggie.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
He knows what's at the mill.

39:00.000 --> 39:05.000
You keep looking at Geralt every time he's talking, and she keeps saying, what, what

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
in the world do you keep looking over there for?

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
And she's looking over there too and just in bewilderment, and she's very confused.

39:12.000 --> 39:18.000
Clark, don't you remember all our good times together at the library when I tried to teach

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
you how to read at a first grade level?

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
I start walking toward Mr. Fingersen, and I hold out my hand.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Can I touch him?

39:25.000 --> 39:31.000
As you walk toward Mr. Fingersen, I think he probably backs up, and then you continue.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
You have that dead wrong narrator.

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
I want nothing more than to hold hands with Clark.

39:38.000 --> 39:47.000
As Geralt Fingersen holds out his hand to grab yours, you reach out and grasp onto nothing.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Fuck.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
Clark.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Clark has freaked the fuck out.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
I need you to roll sanity.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
My sweet baby boy.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Stay with me.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Hold on.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
I pass.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
An 18 on a 23.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
And with that, Geralt Fingersen dissipates.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
Oh, shit.

40:08.000 --> 40:13.000
I think that freaks Clark out in and of itself too, that he's now lost the thing that was

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
kind of helping him at this moment.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
What about cashew chicken sundae?

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Okay, I'm done.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
What about cashew chicken sundae?

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Yeah.

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
As he floats, he just turns into dust.

40:25.000 --> 40:29.000
Actually, no, as Mr. Fingersen is disappearing, Clark is going, no, no, no, no.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
And he's gone.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
Clark, are you with me?

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Are you here?

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
I turn very solemnly to Maggie.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Yeah, I'm here.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
I'm here.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
All right.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Get your head straight.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
We got a lot of work to do.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Maggie, I'm leaking pretty bad here.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
I'm going to get some ice and fill up this bag just to be safe.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Yeah, okay.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
What's in there?

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
I don't know exactly, but it looks like blood coming out of it.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
If there's ice around it, I assume they were trying to preserve it in some way.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
Frankly, I'm afraid that it's the hole in me, Maggie.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Oh my God.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Oh my.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
And she begins to move some of the ice around.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
She wants to see what's in there.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
I let her.

41:08.000 --> 41:15.000
Okay, so she starts moving the ice back away and moving down around this metal rod that's

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
in there.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
It's a hollow metal rod that's in there.

41:18.000 --> 41:24.000
She moves enough ice out of the way that you both look down and you see a heart.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
That has been impaled by this rod straight through the heart.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
And when she sees that, she goes, that explains quite a bit.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
She goes, all right, we're on a time crunch.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
I'll be in the car.

41:37.000 --> 41:42.000
I go to the freezer and I crack all the ice trays that I can.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
He's probably only got a couple.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
He's just got two.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
He's a normal American.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
He's got two ice trays.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
I throw those in the bag.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I crack them up and dump them in the bag.

41:52.000 --> 41:57.000
Okay, so you go outside and Maggie Cook's car is out there.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
What would Maggie Cook be driving now?

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
I'm nervous that we've said before what she drives off duty.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
I think we said a Bronco maybe.

42:04.000 --> 42:09.000
I think she had a truck, but that truck is still wherever it would have been.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
She's in new wheels now.

42:11.000 --> 42:19.000
So I'm going to put her in a silver Camry, just a real common car.

42:19.000 --> 42:24.000
And as you guys are driving out of the suburbs of the city

42:24.000 --> 42:29.000
and what you would know as toward the mill outside on the other side of the city,

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
you guys are in the car just sitting in complete silence.

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
Clark wants to look in the little canvas bag that's inside the ice bag.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
I guess next to my heart, next to a heart that I think is my heart.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
Next to a heart that you could reasonably.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
Hey, that looks like my heart.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
I recognize this heart. It's familiar.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
I feel like it's been inside me.

42:52.000 --> 42:59.000
When you grab this canvas bag that is cold and wet and it's got a little blood on it, this is it.

42:59.000 --> 43:04.000
Oh, he just handed me a small canvas bag in real life. Oh my God.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
I'm opening it.

43:06.000 --> 43:13.000
It looks like little tiny puzzle pieces maybe, little pieces of cardboard.

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
Little pieces. Oh, there's letters on the backs.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
Okay. It's going to spell a word, I believe.

43:20.000 --> 43:27.000
I guess I can just tell you as I see them, S-T-L-E-N-R and a symbol.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
The symbol is a square with a circle in the square.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
It's a stlearner.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
I figured it out, Zach. It's stlearner.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
You get a hundred luck. You nailed it.

43:40.000 --> 43:50.000
Yeah, in the car you pull this bag out and you look at what's inside and it is these cut pieces of this material

43:50.000 --> 43:56.000
with a coloration on one side and letters on the other with a symbol.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Joe knows what these are and I think Clark does too.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
Hit me with it.

43:59.000 --> 44:03.000
They're the letters they give you in the final round of Wheel of Fortune.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
It's missing the I though and the I might be the symbol.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Are you sure about that, Joe?

44:08.000 --> 44:17.000
Clark is making that too. Clark is like, these are those letters that they always give you at the end of Wheel of Fortune.

44:17.000 --> 44:22.000
I'm going to give you ten luck for getting that so fast.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Fuck yeah.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
So what's that put your luck up to?

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
I got 55.

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
And you guys are in the car just sitting in complete silence.

44:32.000 --> 44:41.000
Maggie, can you tell me why are you alive?

44:41.000 --> 44:46.000
I saw you were kind of standing by my dad's old book.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
Yeah, that leather book.

44:49.000 --> 44:56.000
It's got some real importance for me and people like me and soon to be people like you.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
There's a prophecy in there, Clark.

45:00.000 --> 45:06.000
And that prophecy is the revelation of the overseer.

45:06.000 --> 45:15.000
And what it says is that it is only through death that he may rise again.

45:15.000 --> 45:25.000
We believe the overseer is coming and he's going to set an order in the world and I've been preparing his way.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
That's what we do at the Circle of Knowledge.

45:29.000 --> 45:37.000
Well, not only that, we're also fighting on the forefront to keep this world safe from the unnatural that's on the other side.

45:37.000 --> 45:47.000
And Clark, I was against it at first and she kind of breaks a little bit and she's much more comfortable now talking with you.

45:47.000 --> 45:55.000
And she's like, I didn't I didn't believe in the way things were going and I didn't understand.

45:55.000 --> 46:00.000
But now I'm I'm starting to understand a little bit more about how the world works.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
You know, it's fire that keeps this world going.

46:04.000 --> 46:09.000
You know, it's it's fear. People can't handle that knowledge, Clark.

46:09.000 --> 46:17.000
Most people. But you can. I can. We can. People like us. People in the Circle of Knowledge.

46:17.000 --> 46:25.000
And we've been tasked with this responsibility and it's a big one. We keep the world moving.

46:25.000 --> 46:30.000
What was your question?

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
I'm at Leon. I'm at Leon Simpson.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Yeah, that's right. Leon's a cool guy.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
Maggie, we've been dealing with some stuff for the last five days or so.

46:39.000 --> 46:44.000
And it sounds like the crazy knowledge, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
You were just spouting out at me and you were not there.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
I couldn't be there, Clark, but I knew that you guys could handle it.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
We couldn't, Maggie. We couldn't handle it.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Well, where are we at?

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
I just want to know why you weren't around.

47:00.000 --> 47:07.000
Clark, does the ant question when it is being moved by a boot?

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
The things that you have been dealing with, they may seem large.

47:11.000 --> 47:16.000
I guarantee you, you haven't seen anything yet.

47:16.000 --> 47:22.000
After driving about 10 miles past the city, you take the country road that leads out to the mill.

47:22.000 --> 47:29.000
Trees on either side of the road have grown to meet above, making a verdant tunnel that encases you.

47:29.000 --> 47:36.000
A few miles down this road you see a small sign next to a gravel path that leads into the thick woods.

47:36.000 --> 47:41.000
The sign says, the mill, on our grind and crushing it.

47:41.000 --> 47:48.000
That gravel path leads to an opening where just enough trees have been removed to open up space for a parking lot

47:48.000 --> 47:56.000
and a massive brick building with two enormous smokestacks reaching up into the canopy of trees encircling this property.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
It makes you feel small.

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
The trees must be at least 12 stories tall.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
And you pull into the mill.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Oh, shit.

48:06.000 --> 48:12.000
And you guys park and she walks you into the mill and you go through a couple doors, corridors.

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
There's people all over the place working. They're not paying any attention to you whatsoever.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Even though I'm stylin'.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Even though you look...

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
Oh, you are such a wreck!

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Do you still have this bag of ice?

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
Yeah, totally.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
You're just carrying it with you.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
As far as I'm concerned, that's my heart in that bag. I'm not gonna let it out of my sight.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Yeah, absolutely. That makes sense.

48:35.000 --> 48:43.000
So even though you look like a fucking lunatic, no one pays you any mind as you follow Maggie Cook.

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
Real fast, has Clark ever been to the mill in his life?

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
No.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Other than what's happened in the last few days?

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
And then also, do I recognize anybody in the halls? Is there any familiar faces?

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
You recognize no one in the halls.

48:56.000 --> 49:02.000
As you're going through these halls, you go through doorway after doorway that leads you to stairs and then other stairs.

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
And then finally, this one corridor of stairs that's blocked off.

49:06.000 --> 49:12.000
She walks up to it and there's a scanner on one side of the door and she clicks a button.

49:12.000 --> 49:17.000
And this little thing pops up and she sticks her armpit over it.

49:17.000 --> 49:21.000
And then it beeps and it goes back into the wall and the door opens.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
And you guys walk down these stairs.

49:23.000 --> 49:29.000
Did that take your temperature, Maggie? Is that what that was? That's how you take a kid's temperature.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
Oh yeah, no. You get into all these doors with your pubic hair.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
Oh, of course. That makes sense. That's how you do it.

49:42.000 --> 49:52.000
So you walk down and at this point, when the door opens, everything on the other side is completely different building structure than what you've been walking through before.

49:52.000 --> 50:00.000
Everything past here is cold stone and it is a spiral staircase that leads down, down, down.

50:00.000 --> 50:06.000
And it is quite dark, but you are led by a flickering light that is coming from the bottom.

50:06.000 --> 50:12.000
And when you make it down to the bottom of the stairs, you are standing in a room that you have been in before.

50:12.000 --> 50:19.000
And it is this circular domed room that is concrete all the way through.

50:19.000 --> 50:26.000
And these familiar slabs are set up where there's one in the middle and there's six surrounding it.

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
As you walk in there, there are already two bodies on each slab.

50:31.000 --> 50:48.000
And attached to each of these bodies is a xenonema toad, which is one of those crazy looking, just like this oily, squamous material that is actually this creature that you've seen the mouth of before.

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
And you've seen the razor sharp teeth with the teeth inside of it.

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
How are they attached to the bodies? Everybody has a different place?

50:55.000 --> 51:03.000
Everybody has it in a different place and all of these people, they are covered in open sores from other placements.

51:03.000 --> 51:12.000
And their skin is rotting and gross looking. Are any of them conscious? No one is conscious. Everyone's eyes are closed.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
Maggie walks you into this room.

51:16.000 --> 51:21.000
Alright, Clark. Well, this is the fun part.

51:21.000 --> 51:27.000
To get inducted into the circle of knowledge, I'm going to need you to have a quick lie down on this table here.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
And she points to the slab in the middle of the circle.

51:32.000 --> 51:38.000
Whoa. Leon said he wasn't going to make me have to put one of those things. He said I didn't have to sacrifice flesh or limb.

51:38.000 --> 51:44.000
Well, you're not going to have to sacrifice limb and you're only going to have to sacrifice a little flesh.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
But the game has changed, Clark. And you're being inducted.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
Real fast, does Clark, can Clark do a comparison between now and the last time he was here?

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
Is it the same number of people roughly in the room? Is it more or less?

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
I think it's the same number. I could be wrong. I think it's the exact same number.

51:59.000 --> 52:05.000
The only difference is that the other two people, Leon Simpson and the woman who was here last time,

52:05.000 --> 52:11.000
neither one of them are in this room. Leon! Leon! I sent them out.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
Leon said I wasn't going to have to do this. Those things freak me out, Maggie.

52:15.000 --> 52:22.000
She grabs your shoulders. Clark, faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.

52:22.000 --> 52:27.000
I don't need you to have faith. I need you to have knowledge.

52:27.000 --> 52:33.000
And she slowly kind of pushes your chest. I let it happen.

52:33.000 --> 52:40.000
And then she moves down to your left foot. You haven't gotten shoes or socks yet, so she doesn't have to take off anything.

52:40.000 --> 52:48.000
And she walks over to the side of the slab and there's this handle in the ground.

52:48.000 --> 53:00.000
And she reaches down and she twists this circular handle, pulls up this big cartridge the size of a...what the fuck?

53:00.000 --> 53:06.000
A parking pylon. Is it that big? Yep. Yep. A parking pylon.

53:06.000 --> 53:17.000
Inside you see one of these creatures. And she, in one swift motion, pulls out the xenonimatode and attaches it to the bottom of your left foot.

53:17.000 --> 53:23.000
And you feel it bite in and your vision immediately goes dark.

53:23.000 --> 53:31.000
Ooh, boy. What's about to fucking happen?

53:31.000 --> 53:40.000
The ground you're standing on is made of light. It is a soft glow that illuminates this new world from below.

53:40.000 --> 53:53.000
You feel strange, content, satiated in every physical way. It is extremely relaxing, but also weirdly involuntary.

53:53.000 --> 54:03.000
Above you is only darkness. In every direction surrounding you, where what could be called the sky meets what could be called the ground,

54:03.000 --> 54:13.000
is blacker than black opaque darkness, except for the 12 figures in the distance and the giant black mass.

54:13.000 --> 54:22.000
They are all dimly lit from below. You would think they would cast a shadow on the sky above if it was anything more than all-consuming darkness.

54:22.000 --> 54:29.000
These 12 figures seem to be following some massive being as they travel away from you.

54:29.000 --> 54:38.000
As you move closer, you hear the chanting. It's soft at first and muffled, but these 12 figures are chanting from deep in their lungs.

54:38.000 --> 54:47.000
And ahead of them, seemingly made from the darkness that surrounds everything in this place, is a towering, lumbering beast.

54:47.000 --> 54:56.000
It walks on two massive legs the size of trees. Its broad shoulders are at least 25 feet from the ground.

54:56.000 --> 55:04.000
As you stare, its image seems to form and reform over and over like incomprehensible little glitches.

55:04.000 --> 55:12.000
And then it roars. Every muscle in your body tenses up at the same time. All air leaves your lungs.

55:12.000 --> 55:19.000
And you begin weeping uncontrollably before you can even hit the ground.

55:26.000 --> 55:37.000
Your eyes open and you come to and you are laying on this table. Maggie Cook is putting this horrible creature back into the ground next to you.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
And she looks up at you and she says,

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
Clark, that thing's coming.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
And we keep it from coming here.

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
What was that, Maggie? What was it?

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
I need you to roll sanity.

55:50.000 --> 55:55.000
The chanting, was it discernible? Was it words? Okay.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Would you have me roll sanity?

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Yes, sir.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
Fail. It's a 37 on a 23.

56:00.000 --> 56:09.000
Oof. Okay. So I'm going to have you half a D6 again for that pretty horrifying and astounding situation that you've just been through.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
Half a 3.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
Alright.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
Make it a 2.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Yes, sir. How many did you have?

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
I had 23.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
Alright. Down to 21. What's your breaking point?

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
18.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
And you didn't roll above your power, did you?

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
No.

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
I got a 60 power. I'll be alright for a while, I think.

56:26.000 --> 56:30.000
I say that it's just a matter of a single roll that makes it not...

56:30.000 --> 56:34.000
Yeah, it's a 40% chance that you freaked out on somebody.

56:34.000 --> 56:39.000
Oh my God, if that had just happened just now, Al, that actually would have been cool.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
That would have been tight.

56:41.000 --> 56:49.000
I'm going to do it anyway. I punch a pumpkin.

56:49.000 --> 56:54.000
Maggie, is there anything you can do about this? And I hold up the bag with my heart in it.

56:54.000 --> 56:59.000
She reaches and grabs the rod and she pulls it out of the bag.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
If you're Clark, trust me here, you're alive without it. Let me look at it.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Okay.

57:04.000 --> 57:09.000
She grabs the rod. She pulls slowly. She goes, I know, I know.

57:09.000 --> 57:18.000
She lifts it up and then she grabs your heart with one hand and she removes it from the rod like a shish kebab.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
And it starts sputtering blood.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
Oh, Maggie, Maggie.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
And it's going all over the place.

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
I'm trying to get my hand over her hand to stop that sputtering.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
And it's sputtering through your fingers like you've plugged a hose or something.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Do I have any physical sensation when doing that?

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
None at all.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
Okay, cool.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
None at all. She goes, you're fine. You're fine. Look at you. You're staying. You're fine. Alright?

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Now, I want you to see something.

57:41.000 --> 57:48.000
She grabs a small stick from a box in the corner of the room.

57:48.000 --> 57:56.000
She comes back and she slowly puts it into the hollow metal rod and she begins pushing it all the way through.

57:56.000 --> 58:03.000
And then she cups her hand at the end of the other side and through pops two little pieces of metal.

58:04.000 --> 58:09.000
You remember our backup plan for if you didn't come back and finish your last job?

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
You didn't come back in time.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
Oh.

58:13.000 --> 58:17.000
I've tried to take your heart already, Clark. I think you're going to be fine.

58:17.000 --> 58:22.000
I don't have a heart, Maggie. What?

58:22.000 --> 58:27.000
Clark, a lot of things in this world move a lot stranger than we thought they might have.

58:27.000 --> 58:32.000
Yeah. I mean, yeah. I'm seeing that now. That's for sure.

58:32.000 --> 58:38.000
Clark, you're one of us now. And I hate to do this to you right away, but I've got a job for you.

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
You asked where Leon was. He's on a job. I'm going to send you out on one as well.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
What does that mean, Maggie?

58:45.000 --> 58:51.000
I have a lot of responsibility, Clark. I have my eyes on a lot of pies. Alright?

58:51.000 --> 58:58.000
I send you out. You complete the job. You come back. Most of the time, that's all you need to know. Okay?

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
Now, I got kind of a rough one for you right off the top.

59:02.000 --> 59:08.000
But where it's taking place, you are already supposed to be.

59:08.000 --> 59:14.000
I need you to go to the funeral today. It starts in, she holds up her watch, starts in an hour.

59:14.000 --> 59:22.000
It's at the city cemetery. I heard about, you know, Ari dying in the fire.

59:22.000 --> 59:29.000
I was pretty shook up about that. But this does give us quite the opportunity.

59:29.000 --> 59:36.000
You see her dad, Stan Manstein, he's going to be out of the city asylum for the first time in a long time.

59:36.000 --> 59:45.000
He doesn't go out much. And we need to take this opportunity. Clark, I need you to take him out.

59:45.000 --> 59:53.000
You want me to kill Ari's dad at Ari's fucking funeral?

59:53.000 --> 59:58.000
It's actually more of an assassination attempt, but yeah.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Okay. Okay, Maggie. That thing I just saw in that vision, whatever the fuck it was,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
scares me more than anything that I've ever experienced in my life before.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:19.000
If you're telling me, if you're telling me killing Ari's dad is going to stop that thing, fuck it. Sure.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Hand me a gun.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
How are you doing?
