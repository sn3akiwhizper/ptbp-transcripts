02:52.460 --> 03:00.120
not too slow because we know the flow to come say hello to the cameo tempo it's dream girl

03:00.120 --> 03:02.860
with pretty sexual

03:30.120 --> 03:47.620
the tops of trees thick enough to obscure any view of what is below and covered in a

03:47.620 --> 03:54.220
layer of kudzu seem to go on endlessly up and down over hills and valleys mountains

03:54.220 --> 04:01.720
and gorges there is nothing but dense verdant forest a circular calm lake finds itself somewhere

04:01.720 --> 04:07.560
in the midst of this lush wilderness and in the middle of that lake a small island with

04:07.560 --> 04:13.060
less than a quarter mile from shore to shore a long wooden dock on the north side of the

04:13.060 --> 04:19.400
island leads to a charming two-story boat house with six well-kept cedar canoes tied

04:19.400 --> 04:25.500
up below the second story apartment if the island is the face of a clock that dock is

04:25.500 --> 04:31.660
at high noon there are six cute cozy little cottages evenly dispersed along the shore

04:31.660 --> 04:37.920
of the island at one o'clock three o'clock five o'clock seven o'clock nine o'clock and

04:37.920 --> 04:44.240
eleven o'clock five of the six cottages are in pristine condition the eleven o'clock place

04:44.240 --> 04:49.840
might be too but it looks doubtful since the entire building is covered in a massive blue

04:49.840 --> 04:56.480
tarp surrounding each of these cottages is truly master craft landscaping stunningly

04:56.480 --> 05:02.140
gorgeous flowers in every shade and shape fill varied gardens and planters that somehow

05:02.140 --> 05:08.760
both overrun the terrain and complement it perfectly each cottage has a cobblestone walkway

05:08.760 --> 05:13.700
lined on either side by these lovely flower beds and the walkways all make their way to

05:13.740 --> 05:19.100
the center of the island where a large equally cute and cozy hexagonal building sits

05:19.100 --> 05:30.700
break y'all there is a small welcome sign on the south side of this building right at six

05:30.700 --> 05:40.780
o'clock welcome to calm comfy campgrounds and then we go into this main building this main

05:40.780 --> 05:48.020
large hexagonal building and inside we find a room that is circular the wall never ceasing

05:48.020 --> 05:54.020
and never creasing at any point even where the wall meets the ceiling and the floor the angles

05:54.020 --> 06:01.220
are rounded off there are six chairs in a half circle facing a single chair in front of them

06:01.220 --> 06:06.420
each chair has a bottle of water next to it and standing around this room or sitting in

06:06.420 --> 06:11.820
these chairs are the four of you along with two others let's go ahead and go around and

06:11.820 --> 06:18.980
describe these characters who wants to start I'll start my guy is in a really nice white

06:18.980 --> 06:27.420
seersucker suit a nice head of hair on him he's a he's it's slick back and nicely quaffed he's

06:27.420 --> 06:34.940
got big thick rim glasses on and he's handsome and he looks like he takes care of himself and

06:34.940 --> 06:44.580
on his arm is his wife Angela who is a lively young woman with a thick mane of curly hair in

06:44.580 --> 06:52.060
a floral sundress with strappy leather sandals that go up above her ankles and the two of them

06:52.060 --> 07:03.540
are in a corner of the room standing and talking yeah well hey there Joe hey there's that are you

07:03.540 --> 07:14.900
ready for this yeah okay so we see Roger Fairfield and Angela Fairfield a nice young married couple

07:14.900 --> 07:22.940
right standing at six o'clock on this large island surround island surrounded by Lake calm and you

07:22.940 --> 07:29.860
guys are walking up a cobblestone pathway up to a large hexagonal building ahead of you you see

07:29.860 --> 07:36.620
everything the flowers just verdant gardens all around bushes and trees make up much of this place

07:36.620 --> 07:42.060
and through some of them on either side you can see these small cute little cottages tucked away

07:42.060 --> 07:47.580
in their own little areas but ahead of you is this large hexagonal building and you said we were

07:47.580 --> 07:54.740
walking up from six o'clock yes so we started at the south side of yes and Angela looks at you

07:54.740 --> 08:01.540
and she's kind of like bouncing back and forth between from cobblestone to cobblestone and she's

08:01.540 --> 08:09.500
like Raj I just think this is gonna be such a solid experience for you Roger kind of stretches

08:09.500 --> 08:18.260
out he's in a nice white seersucker suit that's his leisure wear yeah yeah of course and he does

08:18.260 --> 08:25.900
a big stretch take in that sweet lake air and that that's that's real nice in it it's beautiful

08:25.900 --> 08:32.100
I'm so glad that we could just get away and really focus on like finding our emotions and really

08:32.100 --> 08:38.540
being able to communicate right Raj I don't know about all that but I'm happy to go along with

08:38.540 --> 08:44.340
whatever you think is gonna help us I think it's gonna be great and she like twirls out and spins

08:44.340 --> 08:50.860
and it's really taking in the Sun is beating right down on you guys and it is a gorgeous day

08:50.860 --> 08:59.820
here at calm comfy campgrounds but as she's spinning her arms wide stretched taking in all

08:59.820 --> 09:12.060
the vitamin D she can get Jesus I'm the worst you notice that on her arm on the inside of one of her

09:12.060 --> 09:20.340
arms track marks that you have not noticed before and she stops spinning kind of like crumbles into

09:20.340 --> 09:25.820
herself and looks at you she's kind of lurches toward you and throws her arms around your neck

09:25.820 --> 09:33.740
and it's like this is gonna be a perfect weekend to start our marriage off on the right foot kind

09:33.740 --> 09:42.500
of hesitantly but mindfully avoiding asking about those marks yes if you think it's gonna

09:42.500 --> 09:48.980
help us I I'll do what I can turning around you see the sign for calm comfy campgrounds and you

09:48.980 --> 09:56.660
walk up on to this large hexagonal building it's like made of wood almost like like a rustic

09:56.660 --> 10:04.100
hunting house however it seems more modern than that it has certain amenities and you would know

10:04.100 --> 10:17.180
calm comfy campground is a luxury so this is not just a cabin in the woods it's not it's different

10:17.180 --> 10:24.980
than that it's on a island that's on a lake that's in the woods it's completely different gotcha a

10:24.980 --> 10:32.500
cabin on the lake in the woods at the bottom of the ocean the main building this hexagonal

10:32.500 --> 10:40.620
building is similarly bestroon with delightful flowers made of many shades and shapes and as

10:40.620 --> 10:47.940
you guys walk in the inside is equally rustic and elegant and modern and there's a massive wooden

10:47.940 --> 10:54.620
chandelier hanging over the foyer on the desk to your right is a bell with a sign that says please

10:54.780 --> 11:01.900
boop for assistance and a vase with a single red rose there's a little area back there with a chair

11:01.900 --> 11:07.380
but it's currently empty and then you notice on your left there's a table with a coffee pot and a

11:07.380 --> 11:13.740
water cooler on either side of a bowl of fruit Roger's gonna walk over to that Bell and see that

11:13.740 --> 11:20.500
sign huh don't mind if I do and it says boop as he rings says boop as your answer of course you

11:20.500 --> 11:30.740
have to go ahead and roll alertness oh boy first roll or since you're listening for someone coming

11:30.740 --> 11:41.540
roll search okay damn it I failed an 86 on a 60 oh damn I still fail there's just silence and you

11:41.540 --> 11:47.220
don't hear anything but then now that taking up your oral connection in your brain is a slight

11:47.220 --> 11:54.860
little you turn back around there she is Angela with a flask in her hand just like taking a quick

11:54.860 --> 12:01.380
pull and she like puts it down and wipes her mouth she's like some coffee and water over here I mean

12:01.380 --> 12:07.460
that's fine I assume they would have a bar but it's kind of early to be starting in it and Angela

12:07.460 --> 12:12.180
I don't I don't know if we should be drinking before we start are we not on vacation oh you're

12:12.180 --> 12:17.180
right I guess the work is something we can focus on at a sober time that's fine that's fine that's

12:17.180 --> 12:21.460
makes sense and then she puts it back in her little clutch that she was carrying you guys

12:21.460 --> 12:26.260
would have had luggage with you I was just about to ask have we been to our cottage yet no you have

12:26.260 --> 12:33.020
not okay so are you carrying yeah suitcases yeah okay once we once we get checked in then maybe we

12:33.020 --> 12:37.020
can break out the flask I just think that we should focus you know make sure our heads are

12:37.020 --> 12:41.580
clear when they give us instructions and things like that she walks up to you slowly puts her

12:41.580 --> 12:48.820
hand on your chest I just knew that once we got here you would be receptive and you'll make the

12:48.820 --> 12:57.660
best go of this possible I love you look love you too Angie that goes without saying well that was

12:57.660 --> 13:05.540
weird yeah we're gonna get real weird together Oh Joe maybe Oh babe

13:12.580 --> 13:20.220
Thomas my character is off on his own it's the circular room there's no corners but it looks

13:20.220 --> 13:25.540
like he's somehow managed to like squeeze himself into a corner kind of space you don't know how

13:25.540 --> 13:31.420
he's done it but how is he done it he's he's created like he is just projecting this air of

13:31.420 --> 13:38.680
like impenetrable personal space around him and he is he has a pager in one hand and he's looking

13:38.680 --> 13:43.840
down at it and he's talking on a big old-fashioned cell phone in the other hand kind of quietly he's

13:43.840 --> 13:51.080
wearing a nondescript CSU gray hoodie jeans and sneakers and a baseball cap and sunglasses

13:51.080 --> 13:57.000
indoors and you are having a difficult time hearing the person at the other end of your

13:57.000 --> 14:06.240
phone call as the service keeps cutting in and out what did you say and what I I'm having a

14:06.240 --> 14:13.380
difficult time hearing you as the service keeps cutting in and out so good so good wow that was

14:13.380 --> 14:29.120
realistic Thomas Zach you ready yeah Bradley Cooper is standing at six o'clock on the bottom

14:29.120 --> 14:38.640
of this island the listeners can know right yes okay how about this be Bradley Cooper aka other

14:38.640 --> 14:48.240
way around Bradley Cooper okay Martin Cooper are you not also known as so Martin Cupertino

14:48.240 --> 14:53.120
I'll use your real name yeah I mean like if we're solo just call me Martin okay yeah and then

14:53.120 --> 14:58.720
anytime I have to interact with somebody I'll lie okay sounds good I will too and I'll be really good

14:58.720 --> 15:05.760
at it I'm sure I'll never slip up so Martin you're standing at six o'clock on this island and in

15:05.760 --> 15:12.800
front of you is a long cobblestone pathway leading to a large hexagonal building this is the main

15:12.800 --> 15:21.040
main Lodge for the calm comfy campground on either side of this cobblestone pathway or flower beds

15:21.040 --> 15:27.720
just filled with these beautiful flowers of all different shape and shade and on either side of

15:27.840 --> 15:36.440
you are just tons of bushes and trees and greenery it would be decently thick to have to walk through

15:36.440 --> 15:42.840
but you can kind of see through on either side these beautiful little cozy cottages that are

15:42.840 --> 15:49.920
lined out evenly across the island on the shore of this circular island standing there kind of

15:49.920 --> 15:56.880
looking around you notice that kind of behind you off to the side a little bit there's a man

15:56.880 --> 16:04.600
short stout man in his later years older guy he's got a thick white beard he's wearing a dark

16:04.600 --> 16:12.960
navy beanie and a wool plaid shirt under olive corduroy overalls and he is just staring out at

16:13.040 --> 16:19.680
the water Martin takes a deep breath and does it smell does it smell good it smells strange it's

16:19.680 --> 16:26.120
it's it's not a smell that you've smelled before but with the Sun shining down from directly above

16:26.120 --> 16:34.120
on you and this beautiful scenery it makes the smell seem nice is there at least also a smell

16:34.120 --> 16:40.320
of nature around oh yeah absolutely okay he's he takes a deep breath and he's he inhales and he's

16:40.320 --> 16:46.600
not dissatisfied and he notes the guy behind him he also he doesn't take the time to stop and smell

16:46.600 --> 16:54.360
the flowers but he does make an interested note of them but he just walks straight on to the to

16:54.360 --> 16:58.600
the main cabin absolutely and when you get up there there is a sign in front of the building

16:58.600 --> 17:05.400
that says welcome to calm comfy campground and when you walk the main building that you're

17:05.480 --> 17:11.320
walking into is similarly bestroon with all these delightful flowers of many shades and shapes and

17:11.320 --> 17:17.800
when you walk in the inside is similarly rustic and elegant there's a massive wooden chandelier

17:17.800 --> 17:25.120
hanging over the foyer and you see that there is a couple standing right in front of you a young

17:25.120 --> 17:32.720
couple the woman in a sundress and the man in a white seersucker suit and they are holding each

17:32.720 --> 17:41.840
other and an embrace I lower my baseball cap down I just yeah I kind of shrink into my hoodie make

17:41.840 --> 17:47.360
sure my sunglasses aren't real well and I walk by them and I'm trying to find a check-in or something

17:47.360 --> 17:53.040
looking for a check-in immediately to your right you notice that there's a desk with a bell and a

17:53.040 --> 17:59.760
sign that says please boop for assistance also on top of the desk is a vase with a single red rose

17:59.760 --> 18:05.280
in it Martin is pretty pleased because his expedience has brought him a moment where he

18:05.280 --> 18:12.360
can stop and smell this rose he says to himself the shark who stops moving dies but if he gets to

18:12.360 --> 18:18.360
where he's going he might get to smell some blood he boops the bell and and waits

18:18.360 --> 18:31.520
Joe hey Roger here's the ding of the bell over at the desk pulling away from the embrace that

18:31.520 --> 18:38.520

building and you see a sign on it in the distance you can't quite make it out yet all around you are

26:10.600 --> 26:17.680
trees and lush bushes and on either side of the cobblestone walkway there are flower beds filled

26:17.760 --> 26:25.400

27:10.840 --> 27:15.960

27:58.120 --> 28:02.720
large wooden chandelier right above you and to your right there's a desk are we talking lights

28:02.720 --> 28:09.640
or candles lights everything in here is super rustic and like old-looking but modern also very

of fruit Walter looks at his dad and approaches the desk looking into his dad's eyes places his

28:47.280 --> 28:54.160
hand over the bell and looks for some sort of acknowledgement Alan raises his eyebrows ding

28:54.160 --> 29:00.560
ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding and Alan smiles when you first ring the bell but

29:00.560 --> 29:08.800

29:29.160 --> 29:36.040

30:09.800 --> 30:16.040
average average weight brown kind of like a little shaggy a little unkempt hair but still

30:16.040 --> 30:22.120

30:22.120 --> 30:29.920
kind of scruffy facial hair he likes to keep it average as a like a button-up shirt kind of little

30:29.920 --> 30:37.160
messy undid not tucked in jeans some nice leather shoes and yeah he's just kind of a what would you

30:37.160 --> 30:44.040

30:50.760 --> 30:58.560
hey Justin hi what's up man nothing how about you I am very very excited for our session tonight and

30:58.560 --> 31:05.320
I'm also very very excited to have you on the show with an actual with an actual character

31:05.320 --> 31:14.840
you gotta have an actual character otherwise it not less fun so I'll definitely remember your last

31:14.840 --> 31:23.280
name Digby this time yeah can you remember the first name nope and so Charles Digby is standing

31:23.280 --> 31:29.320
at six o'clock on this island if the island was a clock face you were at six o'clock and leading

31:29.320 --> 31:36.480
in front of you is a cobblestone pathway up to a large hexagonal building that is both rustic and

31:36.480 --> 31:42.040
modern it's made mostly wood but there's big glass windows all over it and on either side of the

31:42.040 --> 31:48.480
cobblestone leading up to this building are these large flower beds filled with these gorgeous

31:48.480 --> 31:54.120
flowers that take over most of this island however on either side of the fire beds you see a bunch of

31:54.120 --> 32:08.920
trees and bushes and a very active earth bio things fauna yeah fauna and flora hell yeah there's

32:08.920 --> 32:15.640
so much flora no flauna you can see there's no desert there's no custardy desert there's not

32:15.640 --> 32:22.280
unfortunately maybe inside maybe inside so as you're walking up you see in the distance through

32:22.280 --> 32:28.160
these trees there's these cottages laid out at one o'clock three o'clock five o'clock seven

32:28.160 --> 32:33.880
o'clock nine o'clock and eleven o'clock on this island and through all this dense tree line and

32:33.880 --> 32:38.520
stuff you can still see these cottages they're tucked away and you notice with your keen

32:38.520 --> 32:47.360
investigative eyes so this is an automatic success because your alertness and your search I'm

32:47.360 --> 32:58.400
guessing are super fucking high yes confirmation and so on top of cottage three which is immediately

32:58.400 --> 33:03.240
to your right as you're walking up to this large building you see down this long cobblestone

33:03.240 --> 33:10.000
pathway this cottage and on top of the roof of that cottage just far in the distance but with

33:10.000 --> 33:20.320
your eagle eyes you see a young girl with pigtails on top and she's messing with some wiring hmm can

33:20.320 --> 33:25.960
I get a little closer take a look at that yeah sure my investigative nature would be like I

33:25.960 --> 33:30.960
gotta see what's going on yeah you'll have to get off the trail the path and go through some of the

33:30.960 --> 33:36.400
trees unless you want to go into this building and then around the side yeah let's do that yeah

33:36.400 --> 33:45.520
as you're walking through the brush you notice that she pulls out binoculars oh I'm familiar

33:45.520 --> 33:52.840
with these items and they are pointed directly at you you're not so used to being on this side

33:52.840 --> 34:00.800
of binoculars yeah I think I would uh awkwardly wave to like acknowledge like hi can I can see

34:00.800 --> 34:06.600
you seeing me just like like a kind of an awkward like raise of the hand immediately she dips back

34:06.600 --> 34:14.720
behind this like roof area and is out of sight okay I think I think I'd maybe still keep walking

34:14.720 --> 34:19.360
towards that way or would this be weird what I would I know not to you wouldn't know anything

34:19.360 --> 34:26.720
okay yeah I'll just I will investigate that's what that's what I do baby yeah as you're walking

34:26.760 --> 34:33.920
closer and closer you see this little girl take off running from behind cottage three and she's

34:33.920 --> 34:40.200
running along the shoreline of the lake toward cottage number one I will kind of like hurriedly

34:40.200 --> 34:46.680
follow hey hey what are you doing like trying to get her attention see if she responds at all she

34:46.680 --> 34:52.760
does not turn back and she continues to run toward the cottage and you see she goes around the back

34:52.760 --> 34:59.680
of the cottage and disappears I'm gonna with a hurried a little pep in my step hurry towards

34:59.680 --> 35:05.800
it just to be like what's what's going on here yeah so moving through all these trees and branches

35:05.800 --> 35:11.680
and brambles you make your way into a small clearing where this cottage is and it's really

35:11.680 --> 35:19.000
cute and there's a nice little front door and a window in front and windows on the sides and you

35:19.000 --> 35:25.040
see some movement through one of the side windows and you think it's basically the rough outline of

35:25.040 --> 35:31.480
a small person can I look through the windows without it being like creepy that is entirely

35:31.480 --> 35:38.640
up to the people who watch you creep them yeah I'm gonna try and do a little like like how I would

35:38.640 --> 35:43.840
do like some kind of like stealthy search maneuvers creep up to the window and be able to

35:43.840 --> 35:50.080
like peek roll alert actually first roll stealth sorry I haven't rolled with a character and so

35:50.080 --> 35:57.120
so very long yeah this is is this the first one and the one shot for the patreon oh yeah but yeah

35:57.120 --> 36:05.600
this is the first like this character isn't just hastily Justin party time party time for Justin

36:05.600 --> 36:17.280
with pretending people couldn't remember the name of the show I pass 65 on a 70 okay so looking

36:17.280 --> 36:22.960
through this window you see that there is this young girl with pigtails and she is wearing

36:22.960 --> 36:30.800
overalls with a little striped shirt underneath overalls and she is sitting at the kitchen counter

36:30.800 --> 36:38.280
and eating a sandwich and then walking in from the other room is an average build man he looks

36:38.280 --> 36:45.480
to be in his late 30s but his eyes have aged and his hair his grade like someone who is in the war

36:45.480 --> 36:52.000
or went through some sort of traumatic experience he's wearing a white dress shirt gray slacks and

36:52.000 --> 37:00.120
black shoes and he walks over pours a glass of milk and slides it over to the girl who then

37:00.120 --> 37:08.000
drinks it okay I feel like a fucking creep I feel like a creep number one but I feel like I would

37:08.000 --> 37:14.720
like try to dip out at this point because it looks like that's probably her dad or something yeah I

37:14.720 --> 37:22.200
think at this point I'd be like oh I shouldn't be doing this like oh stealth it again nope it'll

37:22.200 --> 37:26.840
count so you are enrolled a successful stealth we get up to that spot so you know exactly how

37:26.840 --> 37:33.240
to get out of this spot yeah I will duck out to be like okay time to stop being a creep so now

37:33.240 --> 37:38.240
the question you're at one o'clock do you want to enter the main building from that side of the

37:38.240 --> 37:42.680
island or do you want to go all the way back around is there a reason we were going to the

37:42.680 --> 37:47.800
there was just that was where you were and there was a sign on that side of the building that said

37:47.800 --> 37:54.160
welcome to calm comfy campground and you see no such sign from this side okay yeah I'll go to the

37:54.200 --> 38:01.520
main building okay so you walk back through all this brush and all these trees and bushes and I

38:01.520 --> 38:10.400
need you to roll an alertness check for me crit success 22 on a 70 crit success yeah that's

38:10.400 --> 38:20.160
fucking awesome so my first ever as you're walking your foot your toe cap hits a wire

38:20.160 --> 38:28.760
and it lifts up off the ground as you step and immediately your eyes follow this wire to a tree

38:28.760 --> 38:37.960
and then looking about 12 feet up the tree you see the small lens of a camera that's poking out

38:37.960 --> 38:44.560
from a knot in this tree what the fuck can I investigate it yeah what do you want to do how

38:44.560 --> 38:49.200
high up did you say it was 12 feet I'm gonna try and like clamber up it a little bit yeah

38:49.200 --> 38:55.960
roll survival or athletics to climb up this tree because sometimes climbing a tree is for your

38:55.960 --> 39:02.000
survival I'll do athletics because I ain't got no survival I'm from the city man what's your

39:02.000 --> 39:12.840
athletics 50 all right roll it up hard fail okay so trying to get up this tree you realize that

39:12.840 --> 39:17.520
there aren't any branches low enough and there's no like grips on this tree that are in the direct

39:17.640 --> 39:22.720
area to begin a climb so you can't even get off the ground I think I'll just leave it alone for

39:22.720 --> 39:27.560
now because I'm I would assume it's for some kind of security or something and I don't want to like

39:27.560 --> 39:33.080
knock it out with a rock or anything so I would I'm just gonna be like okay that's weird maybe

39:33.080 --> 39:39.520
I'll come back here later sounds good yeah so when you walk back around to the front of this

39:39.520 --> 39:44.640
large building you see that sign and there are two double doors on a porch a couple steps up to

39:44.640 --> 39:50.400
a porch and then the double doors going in I go ahead and enter upon entrance you see this
