WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.340
What is boiling, my dumplings?

00:03.340 --> 00:06.900
It's your chef de cuisine, Wolf the dog.

00:06.900 --> 00:10.480
And I am pinching dough like a mad dog

00:10.480 --> 00:15.300
so I can provide sustenance to all my glorious fans.

00:15.300 --> 00:20.100
Hope y'all like that boiled dough with some mayonnaise inside.

00:20.100 --> 00:25.100
And I am cooking it up live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:25.140 --> 00:30.140
the only radio station to win a Michelin star by force.

00:30.460 --> 00:34.920
This episode's Howlin' with Wolf is from at Sis Fordman

00:34.920 --> 00:37.520
from Maryland, who tweeted about the show

00:37.520 --> 00:39.420
and tagged that pretending pod,

00:39.420 --> 00:43.020
the sixth best thing you can do with your fingers.

00:43.020 --> 00:46.780
They write, the network has been compromised,

00:46.780 --> 00:49.180
root access granted.

00:49.180 --> 00:53.580
The reality we know or knew is DDoSed

00:53.580 --> 00:55.780
and held by dark matter.

00:55.780 --> 00:59.300
All bow, the new pseudo is here.

00:59.300 --> 01:02.420
This exploit is sticking around.

01:02.420 --> 01:05.420
Patch Tuesday, kernel panic.

01:05.420 --> 01:09.460
Your disk is spinning fast and you can't dump the RAM.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.780
Unplug yourself and pray.

01:11.780 --> 01:15.040
Silas Cole is here to fuck up your day.

01:16.020 --> 01:19.780
Sis admin, what the fuck did you just make me read?

01:19.780 --> 01:21.460
If this is about computers again,

01:21.460 --> 01:24.300
I'm going to be so fucking pissed off.

01:24.300 --> 01:26.340
Remember, if you want to write up something

01:26.340 --> 01:29.160
for your cream filled doughy wolf to how,

01:29.160 --> 01:31.700
tag at pretending pod on the internet

01:31.700 --> 01:36.300
or write a five star review on Apple podcasts, please.

01:36.300 --> 01:39.240
If you're one of the blessed angels or demons

01:39.240 --> 01:42.420
who make a post, forget the om,

01:42.420 --> 01:46.600
I just want to say T Hanks, thanks.

01:46.600 --> 01:51.600
I don't want to be cast away in a green mile of thick woods

01:51.640 --> 01:55.200
solely-ing the forest with my gump.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.140
I want to be big.

01:57.140 --> 02:00.120
Now onto the next thing I do.

02:00.120 --> 02:04.640
It's time for the news of the world.

02:04.640 --> 02:08.300
Last time, Don D. Pettymore was confronted

02:08.300 --> 02:12.160
with the fact that his nephew is a non-human being

02:12.160 --> 02:15.480
that currently resides inside its own daddy,

02:15.480 --> 02:16.920
Don's brother.

02:16.920 --> 02:20.000
This was after John, as always, forgot

02:20.000 --> 02:24.640
that not everyone already understands his current condition.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.960
Jack explained, he was searching

02:26.960 --> 02:29.060
for the door out of this place.

02:29.060 --> 02:31.600
Keith promised Leo they'd come back for him

02:31.600 --> 02:34.920
to take him away from this existence.

02:34.920 --> 02:39.040
Don admitted he came to this plane through his Nike bag,

02:39.040 --> 02:42.140
the same one he used as Agent Victor

02:42.140 --> 02:45.680
to dispose of an unnatural rotary phone

02:45.680 --> 02:49.460
that supposedly healed anyone of anything.

02:49.460 --> 02:52.560
John gained a new understanding of his abilities

02:52.560 --> 02:55.640
in this setting, and he dissipated an opening

02:55.640 --> 02:57.480
into the wall of this junk room

02:57.480 --> 03:00.680
where Keith claimed a rope bridge connected

03:00.680 --> 03:03.960
and led to a second stilted bunker.

03:03.960 --> 03:07.440
The group decided to call the number of the rotary phone,

03:07.440 --> 03:09.800
and they heard a ring from across the oily,

03:09.800 --> 03:13.880
colorful bridge inside this duplicate fort.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.760
The entire party witnessed a dreadful sight

03:16.760 --> 03:20.360
as Keith, Don, and Jack all walked out

03:20.360 --> 03:22.920
onto the Bridge of Spies.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.640
Boom, another Tom Hanks reference at the buzzer.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.120
Now listen here.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.360
No, closer, closer.

03:31.360 --> 03:36.360
Get incredibly close so this one is extremely loud.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.840
This track is in a league of its own.

03:39.840 --> 03:44.040
It's Dragon in Three with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?

03:44.040 --> 03:49.040
["What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?" by Dragon in Three plays in the background.]

03:49.840 --> 03:53.960
Bad girls on top of the water

03:53.960 --> 03:58.160
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline

03:58.160 --> 04:02.240
Leaving my mind at your altar

04:02.240 --> 04:05.900
Crossing the double line, doing it every time

04:05.900 --> 04:10.900
Tell me what kind of world are you livin' in?

04:14.700 --> 04:19.700
What kind of world are you livin' in?

04:23.060 --> 04:26.900
Hello, everybody out there pretending to be listening.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.580
We're pretending to be people,

04:28.580 --> 04:33.580
and you are getting ready for another crazy episode.

04:34.580 --> 04:39.060
My name is Zach, and I am your handler,

04:39.060 --> 04:41.220
not your best friend, not your dad,

04:41.220 --> 04:45.980
not your Dungeon Master, just giving you the handler,

04:45.980 --> 04:49.860
handler, hand, handy, giving you, handle, hand,

04:49.860 --> 04:53.740
I'm the hand, I'm here with my second, third, fourth,

04:53.740 --> 04:58.740
and 17th best friends, and how are you guys doing?

05:00.260 --> 05:01.540
Am I 17?

05:02.500 --> 05:03.900
If you have to ask.

05:10.900 --> 05:12.620
I'm doing okay, how are you doing, Zach?

05:12.620 --> 05:14.980
Yeah, I'm doing pretty good.

05:14.980 --> 05:16.140
I'm really sad.

05:16.140 --> 05:16.980
Oh, no.

05:16.980 --> 05:18.700
I was trying to cover it up

05:18.700 --> 05:22.820
by really being over-hyped in the intro, but...

05:22.820 --> 05:25.620
Bud, what's got you down?

05:25.620 --> 05:27.620
My butt turned green.

05:27.620 --> 05:28.460
Oh!

05:28.460 --> 05:29.980
Your butt turned green?

05:29.980 --> 05:30.820
You hate to hear it.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.020
Yeah, the whole thing.

05:32.020 --> 05:32.980
Is it mad?

05:32.980 --> 05:34.100
It's jealous.

05:37.020 --> 05:38.700
My ass is green with envy.

05:38.700 --> 05:41.380
Who's it jealous of, or what is it jealous of?

05:43.220 --> 05:44.060
Apples.

05:44.060 --> 05:46.460
How many apples could you fit in there?

05:47.980 --> 05:49.780
Inside or just within the cheeks?

05:49.780 --> 05:53.660
Because I think just within the cheeks I could get two,

05:53.660 --> 05:56.380
but I don't think any are going in my actual asshole.

05:56.380 --> 05:58.260
Oh, standing up for sure, I mean.

05:58.260 --> 05:59.860
Yeah, wow.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.260
I don't think I could get any

06:01.260 --> 06:03.540
unless I could use the stem,

06:03.540 --> 06:04.980
and the stem was nice and long.

06:08.420 --> 06:11.500
Like an apple tree branch filled with mini apples.

06:11.500 --> 06:14.740
You could just drag them along like a dog.

06:15.780 --> 06:19.100
Can I bite the apple into a shape

06:19.100 --> 06:21.660
that might be more fitting?

06:21.660 --> 06:24.380
As long as you put the whole thing in you,

06:24.380 --> 06:25.380
you can slice it up.

06:25.380 --> 06:26.220
Okay.

06:27.340 --> 06:28.260
Okay.

06:28.260 --> 06:29.100
Do I get to eat it after-

06:29.740 --> 06:33.820
Any part you slice off does have to go up there.

06:33.820 --> 06:35.780
Yeah, the whole thing has to.

06:37.900 --> 06:39.660
You guys know when you're eating an apple

06:39.660 --> 06:42.660
and you bite down where the skin meets the flesh,

06:42.660 --> 06:46.100
like the inside, and the skin just goes right up

06:46.100 --> 06:47.220
in between your teeth?

06:47.220 --> 06:49.060
That's awful.

06:49.060 --> 06:49.900
No.

06:49.900 --> 06:52.300
Yeah, try not to think about that

06:52.300 --> 06:54.740
with your butt instead of your mouth, huh?

06:54.740 --> 06:56.460
But your butt doesn't have teeth, though.

06:56.460 --> 06:58.220
I'm doing this new thing where I say, huh?

06:58.260 --> 06:59.900
I like that new thing you're doing, Zach.

06:59.900 --> 07:00.740
Huh?

07:00.740 --> 07:02.060
Your butt doesn't have teeth.

07:03.020 --> 07:05.020
This is a good introduction to the podcast.

07:05.020 --> 07:06.860
Again, right up on that microphone.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.060
Thomas, I can't hear your sadness

07:10.060 --> 07:13.180
if you don't get up on that.

07:13.180 --> 07:16.180
I'm sad about the way you chose to start the podcast.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.060
Do you have a better, do you have an idea?

07:24.220 --> 07:25.940
Yeah, it could just be our normal bullshit,

07:25.940 --> 07:30.100
but maybe you don't talk about shoving apples up your ass.

07:30.100 --> 07:30.940
I don't know.

07:30.940 --> 07:33.060
I didn't start that.

07:33.060 --> 07:36.100
Yeah, it all happened so quick,

07:36.100 --> 07:37.500
no one knows who started it.

07:42.420 --> 07:46.260
Isn't talking about shoving apples up our assholes

07:46.260 --> 07:49.580
exactly what our normal intros are like?

07:49.580 --> 07:51.540
We've probably already done this one.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.420
Okay, what do you want to talk about

07:54.420 --> 07:55.660
putting up our buttholes?

07:56.540 --> 07:58.060
Well, I don't know if you guys have heard

07:58.060 --> 07:59.660
about the fuck barrel, but.

08:01.060 --> 08:04.460
Save it for the den of sin, baby, save it.

08:04.460 --> 08:07.460
Patreon people know what the fuck barrel is all about.

08:07.460 --> 08:08.300
Yeah, they do.

08:08.300 --> 08:11.340
Are they gonna have early access to buy it

08:11.340 --> 08:13.300
before the general public?

08:13.300 --> 08:15.740
They're gonna have a lot of access.

08:15.740 --> 08:16.660
Oh, hell yeah.

08:18.260 --> 08:20.620
Ah, the bridge, I jump off the bridge.

08:20.620 --> 08:21.780
Back to safety.

08:22.620 --> 08:26.580
Ah, the bridge.

08:28.380 --> 08:29.540
Take it to the bridge.

08:36.580 --> 08:41.580
Like the last episode ended on a bit of a cliffhanger.

08:41.740 --> 08:46.620
And so first I need stealth roles.

08:46.620 --> 08:49.100
Yes, slight pun intended, I suppose.

08:49.140 --> 08:51.780
I need stealth roles from Clark Bishop

08:51.780 --> 08:55.220
and John Lee Kevinmore because they were trying

08:55.220 --> 09:00.220
to avoid being seen by a pair of children,

09:01.700 --> 09:03.900
the Littles, Aiden and Alice,

09:03.900 --> 09:08.900
who they had one interaction with previously.

09:08.940 --> 09:13.940
Yeah, we got them sucked up into this world through a vacuum.

09:15.940 --> 09:17.740
Am I close enough to hear him say this?

09:17.740 --> 09:19.980
No, this is his own internal narration

09:19.980 --> 09:24.980
as he has reminded himself.

09:25.300 --> 09:29.700
Yes, he's reminded himself as he expertly avoids

09:30.540 --> 09:33.580
identification by these children with a 39 on a 50.

09:33.580 --> 09:34.540
Oh, well done.

09:34.540 --> 09:38.820
Unfortunately, Clark is like peeking his head out

09:38.820 --> 09:42.340
and like, what, what are we trying to avoid being seen by?

09:43.620 --> 09:45.940
Cause he rolled a 65 on a 30.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.420
Hey, look, it's those kids.

09:50.580 --> 09:52.540
Hey, look over there and he's pointing.

09:53.980 --> 09:58.020
Aiden and Alice Little are looking back up at Clark Bishop,

09:58.020 --> 10:01.620
who's hanging out, hanging out Beatles style

10:01.620 --> 10:03.140
of this doorway.

10:03.140 --> 10:06.060
And they both give you the,

10:06.060 --> 10:08.980
who's the meet the Fokker's dad?

10:08.980 --> 10:10.820
Robert De Niro.

10:10.820 --> 10:13.540
Yeah, yeah, that's what I know him from best.

10:13.540 --> 10:16.500
He's giving you the best, like Robert De Niro,

10:16.500 --> 10:19.340
pointing two fingers at their eyes,

10:19.340 --> 10:22.180
these little twin children eyes,

10:22.180 --> 10:24.540
and then pointing those same two fingers

10:24.540 --> 10:26.580
right up at Clark Bishop.

10:26.580 --> 10:29.800
John Lee Pettymore still has Clark's compact

10:29.800 --> 10:32.100
and he's like watching that over his shoulder.

10:33.980 --> 10:37.460
And that, well, that's exactly, he just gives a big woo.

10:40.180 --> 10:41.460
How old are the kids?

10:41.460 --> 10:42.460
Oh, they're children.

10:42.460 --> 10:44.600
Okay, that's as specific as you got.

10:45.540 --> 10:47.700
Yeah, I don't think I ever said maybe like

10:47.700 --> 10:50.940
anywhere between 10 and 12, so 11.

10:50.940 --> 10:51.900
Sigh.

10:51.900 --> 10:55.580
Damn, that's getting into like capable rascal territory.

10:57.140 --> 10:59.660
I was picturing way more, like these are,

10:59.660 --> 11:04.020
these might be like pretty crafty little bastards.

11:04.020 --> 11:06.300
And I was kind of picturing like much younger children

11:06.300 --> 11:07.700
that we could just kind of, you know,

11:07.700 --> 11:09.660
push off the bridge or something, but.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.260
Ah, 11's normal.

11:11.260 --> 11:13.660
I'm really glad, I'm really glad they didn't see me.

11:13.660 --> 11:16.000
They are standing on a boat.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.940
Did you say they're both little?

11:17.940 --> 11:21.540
That's funny, because their last name is Little.

11:21.540 --> 11:24.420
So the boat that is made of this inky darkness

11:24.420 --> 11:26.940
that's super colorful has been written on

11:26.940 --> 11:31.620
with the shimmering silver sea seemingly.

11:32.560 --> 11:36.580
There are shiny numbers all over the whole of the boat

11:36.580 --> 11:40.980
and it is the numbers that spell overseer.

11:40.980 --> 11:44.120
And the figurehead of the vessel is a young man

11:44.120 --> 11:48.820
with curly black hair who Don seemingly recognized.

11:48.820 --> 11:50.540
You could see it in his eyes.

11:50.540 --> 11:55.540
And I mean, this dude is being melted continuously

11:56.980 --> 12:01.140
about from the waist down as he's halfway in the water

12:01.140 --> 12:04.800
and his mouth has been steeled shut as well.

12:04.800 --> 12:05.800
And he's just like.

12:10.600 --> 12:15.600
He's just crying and screaming out in endless pain.

12:16.040 --> 12:21.040
And Julie Maxwell was wearing a hospital gown.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.140
Couldn't help but notice when I said

12:24.140 --> 12:28.480
that she had a massive gash running down her forehead,

12:28.480 --> 12:31.560
Thomas was cackling a little bit.

12:32.520 --> 12:35.320
Before you said running down her forehead,

12:35.320 --> 12:37.280
there was a pretty big pause when you just said

12:37.280 --> 12:42.120
she has a massive gash and it made me laugh.

12:42.120 --> 12:47.120
Running down her forehead in between her eyes.

12:47.720 --> 12:52.720
Her nose is missing and she smiles with no teeth

12:53.220 --> 12:56.200
or lips on one full side of her face.

12:56.200 --> 12:59.280
You think doo-doo her face being smashed.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.320
Hey, Zach, you just said doo-doo.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.920
Doo-doo her face smash.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.760
I don't have to pile on that particular theme,

13:06.760 --> 13:08.720
but what's this about her doo-doo gash?

13:09.800 --> 13:10.960
Jesus Christ.

13:13.080 --> 13:16.800
She is missing like half of her face

13:16.800 --> 13:21.480
and that side that is missing the teeth and lips has an eye.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.600
There's an eyeball there.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.840
That part isn't missing,

13:23.840 --> 13:27.600
but across her face on the other orbital socket,

13:28.520 --> 13:31.400
if you're at home, don't Google orbital socket

13:31.400 --> 13:33.440
or orbital socket oozing.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.840
But this one is oozing with this dark substance

13:37.840 --> 13:39.320
is pouring out.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.320
Okay, so her head snaps forward

13:42.320 --> 13:46.440
and a metal sphere climbs out

13:46.440 --> 13:51.440
like a massive spidery tendrilly metal thing

13:51.960 --> 13:56.960
just like pulls itself up out of the body of Julie Maxwell

13:57.520 --> 14:00.800
and continues to hold that body

14:00.800 --> 14:02.960
at the end of one of its tendrils

14:02.960 --> 14:06.240
as one of the other ones lashes out

14:06.240 --> 14:11.240
and rips at the bridge that Keith Bishop.

14:11.520 --> 14:12.360
Nope.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.200
You gave it away.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.760
You gave away the big secret

14:17.760 --> 14:20.040
we've been keeping this whole time.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.480
We were all brothers, carnival brothers.

14:22.480 --> 14:23.640
I'm my own grandpa.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.160
In this world, all it takes to get married

14:30.160 --> 14:35.160
is to share a microwaved meal on the same recliner.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.400
So you guys are technically married.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.320
Okay, so this thing just like it plants

14:40.320 --> 14:44.760
some of its legs down into the boat

14:44.760 --> 14:48.560
and then one of them rips out at this rope bridge

14:48.560 --> 14:52.200
that's made out of this same dark and colorful material

14:52.200 --> 14:56.120
and Keith beans and Jack Russell

14:56.120 --> 14:59.800
and who is the third person who is out on that bridge?

14:59.800 --> 15:01.720
Oh, that's right.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.920
It's Don D fucking Pettymore.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.440
The three of you are out on this bridge.

15:07.440 --> 15:12.440
What are you doing as the metal tendril rips down

15:12.920 --> 15:15.440
in between the three of you

15:15.440 --> 15:19.960
and this stilted room that Clark Bishop

15:19.960 --> 15:23.120
and John Lee Kevin Moore are inside?

15:23.120 --> 15:24.680
How far away are we?

15:24.680 --> 15:29.040
Okay, so the bridge is 10 yards

15:29.040 --> 15:30.760
and you're about five yards into it.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.920
You're like exactly halfway.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.520
Also, give me your dexterity.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.200
Mine is 55.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.040
Same.

15:38.040 --> 15:38.880
I got a 60.

15:38.880 --> 15:39.800
60 as well.

15:39.800 --> 15:44.800
Okay, so we'll do the order is Keith, Clark, Don, John.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.200
Don John.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.040
Don John.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.080
Great movie.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.360
Oh yeah, you love film?

15:53.360 --> 15:58.320
Yeah, I guess you could say I'm a cinema enthusiast.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.640
Don John is probably my favorite.

16:00.640 --> 16:01.560
Just has a lot to say.

16:01.560 --> 16:02.960
Not a lot of people get it.

16:02.960 --> 16:03.960
Not a lot of people get it,

16:03.960 --> 16:06.520
but it actually has a lot of really insightful things to say

16:06.520 --> 16:08.920
kind of turns the whole gender thing on its head.

16:08.920 --> 16:09.760
It's real subtle.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.120
And Joseph Gordon-Levitt was the white man to do that.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.640
Yeah, that was actually Joseph Gordon-Levitt

16:14.640 --> 16:17.880
the whole time, which is crazy.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.360
Oh wait, he was Don John?

16:19.360 --> 16:20.720
Yes, the whole time.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.840
Oh, cool.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.840
See, like I said, you always find out new things

16:26.840 --> 16:27.680
about that movie.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.120
So if you consider yourself a film buff,

16:30.120 --> 16:31.080
check out Don John.

16:31.080 --> 16:34.320
All the stunts in the movie, he did for the most part.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.160
That's crazy.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.440
He actually cleaned an apartment as a man?

16:37.440 --> 16:38.280
Yeah.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.520
He did not have a stunt double.

16:40.520 --> 16:41.360
Wow.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.960
Keith, you are in the middle of this rope ridge.

16:43.960 --> 16:48.960
Five yards to your left is the second large stilted room

16:49.340 --> 16:50.360
that you have not been to.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.640
There's a hatch that is just right there, five yards away.

16:53.640 --> 16:56.400
And five yards on your right, on the other side,

16:56.400 --> 16:59.280
you see this John made hole

16:59.280 --> 17:01.880
and you see John kind of hiding.

17:01.880 --> 17:02.840
His back is turned.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.400
He's looking through a compact

17:04.400 --> 17:06.960
as Clark is hanging his head out

17:06.960 --> 17:11.280
and kind of waving at some children who are on this boat.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.480
What do you do?

17:12.480 --> 17:15.200
Above 50, I jumped to the hatch.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.640
Below 50, I jumped back to the John made hole.

17:21.080 --> 17:24.520
87, I jumped to the hatch.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.680
Okay, make a dexterity.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.560
10 on a 60.

17:28.560 --> 17:29.920
Well done, well done.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.000
Okay, fantastic.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.040
So you are running, running, running

17:34.040 --> 17:37.480
as this bridge is falling out beneath you

17:37.480 --> 17:40.760
and you are going to be able to make a leap

17:40.760 --> 17:44.720
without falling to your likely demise.

17:44.720 --> 17:45.560
Good thing you passed that rule.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.400
Oh yeah, good thing.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.440
Clark, what are you doing?

17:47.440 --> 17:48.960
So the bridge is collapsing

17:48.960 --> 17:51.280
from the point that I'm standing, right?

17:51.280 --> 17:52.120
Correct.

17:52.120 --> 17:56.840
Like the bridge part that is nearest you is going to fall.

17:56.840 --> 18:00.600
You're not sure whether or not it will go into the water

18:00.600 --> 18:04.440
but if I said earlier that the bridge is 10 yards long

18:04.440 --> 18:09.440
and from one of the stilted hatch doors of the room

18:10.400 --> 18:14.320
down to the shining, shimmering, shiver sea,

18:14.320 --> 18:17.680
I think I said that was maybe 10 yards, 15 yards,

18:17.680 --> 18:19.680
but it definitely wasn't less than 10 yards.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.680
And so if you're like holding onto the rope bridge

18:22.680 --> 18:27.440
then you'll probably be safe from falling into the not ocean.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.400
But I'm not on the bridge itself though, right?

18:29.400 --> 18:30.240
I'm still in this.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.080
Certainly not.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.560
No, I was just trying to give you an idea

18:32.560 --> 18:35.000
of like what it looks like as it's happening.

18:35.000 --> 18:35.840
So I don't, yeah.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.160
I mean, I don't think I have an action here.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.880
I want to stay on this side of the place

18:40.880 --> 18:43.000
because I'm thinking about the boat

18:43.000 --> 18:45.180
that is still docked on our side.

18:45.180 --> 18:46.860
He's not going to like run out there.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.780
I guess, oh, we're in a room filled with junk, right?

18:49.780 --> 18:51.380
Yes.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.120
I'll see if anything catches my eye

18:53.120 --> 18:54.700
that could be helpful in this situation.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.700
Maybe like bed sheets or something.

18:56.700 --> 18:57.740
I don't know.

18:57.740 --> 18:58.580
100%.

19:02.340 --> 19:06.980
I rolled a 50 on a search and that's not good.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.580
I've got a 20 in search.

19:10.260 --> 19:15.260
Okay, so as you're looking through, you find pillowcases.

19:16.860 --> 19:21.860
It's like bedsheets, but worse.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.500
It's worse than what you were looking for.

19:24.500 --> 19:25.340
These'll work.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.980
Don D. Pettymore, you're up.

19:29.980 --> 19:33.980
Don D. Pettymore is going to like scramble

19:33.980 --> 19:35.380
because the one we were going to

19:35.380 --> 19:37.980
is where the telephone was ringing, correct?

19:37.980 --> 19:38.820
That is correct.

19:38.820 --> 19:42.020
And that is where Keith is like sprinting towards

19:42.020 --> 19:45.700
very like agilely running across this bridge

19:45.740 --> 19:47.780
that is currently falling.

19:47.780 --> 19:50.580
Yeah, I will also like scramble that way.

19:50.580 --> 19:53.260
Okay, roll dexterity or athletics.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.700
Oh, my athletic, nope.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.100
Dexterity it is.

20:00.220 --> 20:01.380
Oh my God.

20:01.380 --> 20:03.980
I got a 54 out of 55.

20:03.980 --> 20:05.540
Oh, oh shit.

20:05.540 --> 20:07.620
Okay, fantastic.

20:07.620 --> 20:12.340
So you are going to be able to make the jump as well.

20:12.340 --> 20:13.820
At the beginning of your next turn,

20:13.820 --> 20:15.620
you're going to be able to make that jump.

20:16.620 --> 20:19.940
John, you see Clark digging through

20:19.940 --> 20:21.700
and finding pillowcases.

20:21.700 --> 20:22.660
What are you doing?

20:23.820 --> 20:27.180
How close is the boat to us?

20:27.180 --> 20:29.180
And specifically the John Mayhole?

20:29.180 --> 20:31.500
Picture it like a triangle.

20:31.500 --> 20:35.980
You are 10 yards away from the hatch that is across

20:35.980 --> 20:39.760
and then you are 10 yards away from the boat

20:39.760 --> 20:42.660
that is an equilateral triangle.

20:42.660 --> 20:45.460
I see that everybody else who's out there on the bridge

20:45.460 --> 20:49.300
is currently running to the other bunker, correct?

20:49.300 --> 20:50.900
Yeah, Jack Russell hasn't gone yet.

20:50.900 --> 20:52.100
So he hasn't moved

20:52.100 --> 20:55.300
because that's how games work in real life too.

20:55.300 --> 20:58.380
But the other two are certainly running away from you.

20:58.380 --> 21:01.420
John, just I want to just start like closing

21:01.420 --> 21:02.420
the John Mayhole.

21:03.540 --> 21:06.540
Rad, oh shit.

21:06.540 --> 21:09.020
Okay, roll unnatural.

21:09.980 --> 21:12.820
39 on a?

21:12.820 --> 21:14.460
More than that.

21:14.460 --> 21:15.980
More than that.

21:15.980 --> 21:18.740
One of these days you're going to fail that roll.

21:18.740 --> 21:20.460
Oh, there I see it, 67.

21:20.460 --> 21:21.460
Describe it.

21:21.460 --> 21:25.760
He looks like he's frantically like trying to mop up a mess

21:25.760 --> 21:27.260
with his hands.

21:27.260 --> 21:30.440
He doesn't make like a good or like,

21:30.440 --> 21:32.780
it doesn't look like a manmade solid wall

21:32.780 --> 21:34.580
like it might have before.

21:34.580 --> 21:37.340
You can actually see like his fingerprints and stuff

21:37.340 --> 21:42.180
as he just like quickly goo-clayed it back into solid.

21:42.180 --> 21:45.220
That's super cool, I can picture it.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.980
And he leaves a tiny little peephole

21:48.580 --> 21:49.940
so they can see what's going on.

21:49.940 --> 21:52.740
Incredible, incredible.

21:52.740 --> 21:55.620
Okay, so as you're looking through this tiny little peephole

21:55.620 --> 21:59.520
you're probably the only one who sees Jack Russell.

21:59.520 --> 22:03.860
I'm going to do the same roll that Luke did,

22:03.860 --> 22:05.940
above 50 goes towards them,

22:05.940 --> 22:08.940
under 50 tries to go back where he came from,

22:08.940 --> 22:10.820
which is now closed.

22:10.820 --> 22:12.000
I rolled a 94.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.140
And so he's going to take off running

22:15.140 --> 22:19.540
to follow Keith and Dawn, and he rolls a 10.

22:19.540 --> 22:23.280
So Jack Russell is going to run along.

22:23.280 --> 22:25.140
So the three of you, picture it like,

22:25.140 --> 22:28.900
I'm picturing a Wes Anderson framing of this scene

22:28.900 --> 22:31.700
because it's very flat, you know.

22:31.700 --> 22:34.260
You've got this endless background behind you,

22:34.260 --> 22:37.500
but then you have two identical stilted rooms

22:37.500 --> 22:39.260
on either side of the frame,

22:39.260 --> 22:42.620
10 yards above this silver sea

22:42.620 --> 22:45.900
that just goes on endlessly into the background.

22:45.900 --> 22:48.780
And then there's a bridge hanging in the middle.

22:48.780 --> 22:53.140
Jack, Dawn, and Keith are sprinting to the right

22:53.140 --> 22:56.660
as the bridge collapses from the left.

22:56.660 --> 23:00.340
And as they run, the three of them kind of jump out.

23:00.340 --> 23:03.100
And I'm picturing kind of a railing

23:03.100 --> 23:06.100
going around the outside on this one maybe.

23:06.100 --> 23:10.220
And so Keith is able to make the leap

23:10.220 --> 23:13.500
and hopefully grab on.

23:13.500 --> 23:18.500
So Keith, go ahead and roll as you see behind you,

23:19.900 --> 23:24.900
this giant ball after it crashes down.

23:25.060 --> 23:26.580
John, you can see this too

23:26.580 --> 23:29.340
through your thimble sized hole.

23:29.340 --> 23:30.180
Little smaller.

23:31.100 --> 23:33.260
Oh, I got tiny thimbles, dude.

23:33.260 --> 23:34.380
And so.

23:35.900 --> 23:37.140
I just don't want your spider thing

23:37.140 --> 23:38.540
poking one of its legs through it.

23:38.540 --> 23:40.820
I'm trying to head off that eventuality.

23:42.300 --> 23:45.460
You're not gonna tell me how big my hole was.

23:46.820 --> 23:48.300
How many apples can fit through it.

23:48.300 --> 23:49.660
And so you.

23:50.740 --> 23:52.580
Can you chop them up?

23:52.580 --> 23:53.420
We can talk about that.

23:53.420 --> 23:55.180
I'm pretending to be people after dark.

23:55.860 --> 24:00.860
These metal tendrils move into the shimmering sea.

24:02.980 --> 24:07.980
They're planting themselves into this silvery ocean

24:09.500 --> 24:11.860
and you hear a noise.

24:11.860 --> 24:16.380
And you see these tendrils are all the same texture.

24:16.380 --> 24:19.980
It's this shiny, shiny metal.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.340
It's like the same texture,

24:21.340 --> 24:25.620
but a solid of the ocean that is out there.

24:25.620 --> 24:27.180
And you hear this like.

24:36.580 --> 24:40.780
And you think that it is coming from the ball.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.420
It is like reverberating this noise

24:43.420 --> 24:45.540
through the world that you're in.

24:45.540 --> 24:49.100
Does it sound like a person going re re re re re re re re

24:49.100 --> 24:51.420
or is it actually like metallic sounds?

24:51.420 --> 24:54.460
It is metallic sounding.

24:54.460 --> 24:59.460
However, it does sound like the vocalizations of an entity.

25:02.940 --> 25:07.140
Can you roll intelligence for me?

25:07.140 --> 25:08.060
Can I roll on that?

25:08.980 --> 25:09.820
Yeah.

25:09.820 --> 25:10.660
Since I'm looking out the window.

25:10.660 --> 25:12.780
I failed a 60 on a 55.

25:12.780 --> 25:16.740
I passed a 54 on a 60 or 75.

25:16.740 --> 25:19.340
John, as you're actually looking at this thing,

25:19.340 --> 25:22.020
you're seeing it's like kind of stilted movements

25:22.020 --> 25:26.900
of the ball as this noise is coming out of it seemingly.

25:26.900 --> 25:31.900
Not only do you realize that even in ball form,

25:31.940 --> 25:36.580
you would still be able to speak and vocalize

25:36.580 --> 25:38.260
just like this thing is.

25:38.260 --> 25:40.300
And it might sound like a little metallic,

25:40.300 --> 25:42.660
but it would be your voice.

25:42.660 --> 25:47.660
And this thing's voice sounds animalistic

25:47.780 --> 25:51.140
and taking that idea one step further,

25:51.140 --> 25:56.140
you think that this ball might've been inside an animal

25:57.060 --> 25:59.500
for the past, who knows how long.

25:59.500 --> 26:00.580
It's the raccoon.

26:00.580 --> 26:02.660
And that's why it speaks like this.

26:02.660 --> 26:04.300
Holy shit.

26:04.300 --> 26:05.860
It's a feral ball.

26:07.020 --> 26:08.740
Yeah, it's a rabid ball.

26:09.980 --> 26:10.900
That's so dope.

26:11.900 --> 26:14.780
Yeah, so John like looks back at Clark

26:14.780 --> 26:18.180
who's frantically gathering pillowcases, I guess.

26:18.180 --> 26:20.780
And he's like, quick update, door's closed.

26:20.780 --> 26:21.900
We got a peephole.

26:21.900 --> 26:24.100
That ball is some kind of feral ball.

26:25.300 --> 26:27.980
So we probably don't need these pillowcases then.

26:27.980 --> 26:31.220
I don't really know where I was going with that anyway.

26:31.220 --> 26:32.140
And he drops it.

26:32.140 --> 26:33.460
I mean, it can't hurt.

26:35.700 --> 26:36.980
Oh, okay.

26:36.980 --> 26:38.500
Gather some back up.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.140
Find a Sharpie in here.

26:40.220 --> 26:41.500
You could draw a little face on it.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.980
And then that could be your mask from those kids.

26:47.180 --> 26:49.820
You know, you give it like glasses and grumpy eyebrows

26:49.820 --> 26:52.380
and a big beard, and then it won't look like Clark.

26:52.380 --> 26:53.220
They're kids.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.580
They wouldn't know.

26:54.580 --> 26:55.420
Exactly.

26:55.420 --> 26:56.500
They're stupid idiots.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.300
Yeah, they're just a couple morons, you know?

26:59.300 --> 27:00.140
So.

27:01.540 --> 27:03.980
Keith, roll athletics or dexterity

27:03.980 --> 27:07.220
in order to reach out and grab.

27:07.220 --> 27:08.060
93.

27:08.180 --> 27:09.020
Ooh.

27:09.980 --> 27:11.300
On what though?

27:11.300 --> 27:12.340
A 60.

27:12.340 --> 27:13.180
Oh.

27:15.740 --> 27:16.580
On a hundred.

27:16.580 --> 27:18.300
Good thing I have a hundred decks.

27:19.820 --> 27:21.460
You know how jacked Keith is.

27:21.460 --> 27:22.620
You know, yeah, you know how Keith

27:22.620 --> 27:24.740
was always darting off to the Olympics.

27:27.260 --> 27:29.300
Every four years, he was really busy.

27:29.300 --> 27:30.420
I know this isn't the rules,

27:30.420 --> 27:31.900
but can I do a saving throw?

27:34.180 --> 27:35.180
Fuck yeah.

27:36.180 --> 27:37.460
Uh, no.

27:37.460 --> 27:39.460
So you fall.

27:39.460 --> 27:40.380
He could spend luck.

27:40.380 --> 27:41.460
Oh.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.300
I don't.

27:42.300 --> 27:43.780
Ooh, well, how much luck do I have?

27:43.780 --> 27:45.580
That would be a lot of luck, huh?

27:45.580 --> 27:46.420
Is it?

27:46.420 --> 27:47.260
It's not luck.

27:47.260 --> 27:49.340
Luck doesn't start over with the new sheet, does it?

27:49.340 --> 27:50.180
Ha!

27:52.180 --> 27:53.460
Okay, you begin falling.

27:53.460 --> 27:54.300
Do you want to describe it?

27:54.300 --> 27:56.740
Yeah, I am running along the bridge

27:56.740 --> 27:59.340
and then obviously start to lose footing.

27:59.340 --> 28:03.220
And I like jump and I smack my arms

28:03.220 --> 28:05.380
on where like the railing is.

28:05.380 --> 28:06.340
This room is hot.

28:06.340 --> 28:08.100
This area is pretty hot, right?

28:08.100 --> 28:08.940
Cause of the melted ocean.

28:08.940 --> 28:10.700
We've not talked about the temperature.

28:10.700 --> 28:13.340
Well, how would you describe the temperature in this room?

28:13.340 --> 28:17.060
It is exactly room temperature.

28:17.060 --> 28:19.460
Oh, well I'm just sweaty cause I'm nervous

28:19.460 --> 28:22.180
and my hands hit the bars.

28:22.180 --> 28:24.660
I grab on just for a second,

28:24.660 --> 28:27.860
like try to pull myself up and then slip off

28:28.980 --> 28:30.300
and start falling.

28:30.300 --> 28:33.340
So John looking through the peephole

28:33.340 --> 28:34.700
relays that back to Clark.

28:34.700 --> 28:37.460
He's like, Clark, you know how every time you go

28:37.460 --> 28:40.180
to shake Vigna's hands, they're a little bit sweaty?

28:40.180 --> 28:41.260
Right, yeah, of course.

28:41.260 --> 28:42.860
Well, that just got the best of him.

28:42.860 --> 28:44.460
We might have to open this hole back up.

28:44.460 --> 28:46.020
He slipped off the bridge there.

28:46.020 --> 28:48.180
Is he in the molten?

28:48.180 --> 28:49.620
Is he in the sea?

28:49.620 --> 28:50.440
Is he gone?

28:50.440 --> 28:53.980
He's slowly falling towards it as you guys are talking.

28:53.980 --> 28:56.540
It seems like he's almost moving in slow motion.

29:01.180 --> 29:02.940
We're just waiting for an action to be taken.

29:02.940 --> 29:05.020
I'm never gonna like tell you to not talk,

29:05.020 --> 29:06.420
you know, in character.

29:06.420 --> 29:09.020
It's like, it's always what I want.

29:09.020 --> 29:11.320
So I'm never gonna cut you off.

29:11.320 --> 29:13.660
Just imagine that it's happening really fast

29:13.660 --> 29:16.700
and everything else action wise, very slow.

29:16.700 --> 29:19.500
So John, what's your theory about what's going on here?

29:19.500 --> 29:20.340
Exactly.

29:20.340 --> 29:22.740
I'm glad you asked that actually.

29:22.740 --> 29:25.180
I've got no fucking clue, man.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.900
I was gonna ask.

29:26.900 --> 29:28.420
I will cut you off.

29:28.420 --> 29:29.740
Clark Bishop, it's your turn.

29:29.740 --> 29:31.380
What do you do?

29:31.380 --> 29:33.000
I mean, I got nothing.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.920
I mean, can I keep searching for a thing

29:34.920 --> 29:36.100
that's 10 yards long?

29:36.100 --> 29:37.380
I don't know how to save a guy

29:37.380 --> 29:40.300
that's falling 10 yards away from me.

29:40.300 --> 29:45.300
Hey, Joe, you probably don't know how to save someone

29:45.500 --> 29:46.860
far away, huh?

29:46.860 --> 29:47.820
Yeah.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.100
Remember guys how I'm doing the huh thing?

29:50.100 --> 29:50.940
Huh?

29:50.940 --> 29:53.700
How to save a life.

29:53.700 --> 29:54.860
Huh?

29:54.860 --> 29:55.820
Huh?

29:55.820 --> 29:58.580
So yeah, Keith is in the fray falling down

29:58.580 --> 30:03.580
and Clark is looking through.

30:03.940 --> 30:07.820
Man, you could really, I mean, a cable car would be able to.

30:07.820 --> 30:09.020
Here's what I wanna do.

30:09.020 --> 30:11.700
I wanna look for something big and flat

30:11.700 --> 30:13.180
that might float down there

30:13.180 --> 30:16.020
and I could try and throw it under Keith

30:16.020 --> 30:18.320
to like stop his fall.

30:20.460 --> 30:24.640
This is, I don't know, a multi-roll maneuver maybe.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.260
Not one, it's an odd one.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.180
No way.

30:30.020 --> 30:32.260
It's an odd one.

30:32.260 --> 30:34.180
The green dice or what I?

30:34.180 --> 30:35.580
Fuck yes, dude.

30:35.580 --> 30:36.800
Hell yes, dude.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.140
Joe just always has one set of dice

30:39.140 --> 30:44.140
sitting on an odd one so that he can squeeze the camera down.

30:44.300 --> 30:46.720
I've been waiting for two years for this.

30:49.740 --> 30:50.820
Fuck yes, dude.

30:50.820 --> 30:51.700
Okay, cool.

30:51.700 --> 30:52.740
Well, what do you find?

30:52.740 --> 30:55.300
What's the perfect item?

30:56.020 --> 30:57.760
An old door is what I came to mind.

30:57.760 --> 30:58.860
I'm picturing Titanic.

30:58.860 --> 31:03.540
I don't wanna throw this lifeboat of a door down there.

31:03.540 --> 31:06.140
Fuck yeah, you find an old door.

31:06.140 --> 31:07.900
It looks really light.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.260
I hold it up and show John.

31:09.260 --> 31:11.180
John, what you gonna do?

31:11.180 --> 31:13.860
And I'm trying to motion that I'm wanting to throw it out.

31:13.860 --> 31:16.540
If you start throwing it at the end of your turn,

31:16.540 --> 31:21.180
I will, at the start of my turn, open up the door again

31:21.180 --> 31:24.620
and hope to time it right so it just sails right on through.

31:24.620 --> 31:26.460
John says that with his eyes

31:26.460 --> 31:29.760
and so Clark begins throwing.

31:31.840 --> 31:35.240
Thomas just looked into the camera with big eyes.

31:39.860 --> 31:41.740
Man, this is such a cool idea.

31:41.740 --> 31:44.060
It's a shame Keith's gonna fall right into the water

31:44.060 --> 31:45.620
at the beginning of his next turn.

31:45.620 --> 31:48.420
All right, so it is Dawn's turn.

31:48.420 --> 31:50.300
Am I rolling to grab?

31:50.300 --> 31:52.820
Yeah, yeah, or whatever you wanna do.

31:53.460 --> 31:57.820
You see Keith ahead of you as slipping and falling.

31:57.820 --> 32:01.760
Are you gonna just grab two-handed onto the railing?

32:01.760 --> 32:04.260
Can I do a special maneuver right now?

32:04.260 --> 32:05.660
I love it when you ask that.

32:06.780 --> 32:07.620
I consent.

32:07.620 --> 32:11.460
Don D. Pattymore seeing this Keith fella

32:11.460 --> 32:13.180
falling in front of him,

32:13.180 --> 32:16.240
I guess in slow motion as I'm also jumping.

32:16.240 --> 32:19.020
Like I love thinking of, it's very anime of us

32:19.020 --> 32:21.700
to have all of us thinking very complete sentences

32:22.220 --> 32:23.980
and all this action's happening.

32:24.980 --> 32:29.420
Having full conversations somehow in a two-second span.

32:29.420 --> 32:32.720
He starts chanting to himself,

32:32.720 --> 32:37.720
vis-a-girl, vis-a-girl, vis-a-girl,

32:37.780 --> 32:39.220
over and over again.

32:39.220 --> 32:42.840
Okay, go ahead and roll dexterity to grab on.

32:42.840 --> 32:43.680
Oh my God.

32:48.060 --> 32:50.780
You got a 24 on a 55.

32:50.780 --> 32:51.860
Oh, hell yeah.

32:51.860 --> 32:55.580
Do you wanna describe grabbing onto this railing, Justin?

32:55.580 --> 32:58.300
Yeah, I just, well.

32:58.300 --> 32:59.140
I fuckin' grab it.

32:59.140 --> 33:00.740
Yeah, I fuckin' grab it, bro.

33:04.540 --> 33:06.840
I do what Keith did except I succeed.

33:10.740 --> 33:13.900
And I light a cigarette in my mouth while I'm doing it.

33:15.740 --> 33:16.940
In slow motion.

33:16.940 --> 33:18.020
Okay, rad.

33:18.020 --> 33:19.560
Jon, roll a natural.

33:19.560 --> 33:23.040
Jon compelled as if,

33:23.040 --> 33:26.600
it's almost like he's sharing a will with Clark.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.560
He just knows to go to the door

33:28.560 --> 33:31.560
and he rolls a 64 on a 67.

33:31.560 --> 33:36.560
And just in time, he slides his hand down the door

33:38.160 --> 33:40.720
and, or down the wall,

33:40.720 --> 33:43.220
and a door-sized slot just opens

33:43.220 --> 33:45.400
right as the door goes flying through.

33:45.400 --> 33:46.640
Oh my God.

33:46.640 --> 33:47.480
Yes.

33:47.480 --> 33:48.600
Fucking incredible.

33:48.640 --> 33:50.080
I am not gonna lie,

33:50.080 --> 33:53.440
I was very much looking forward to Clark

33:53.440 --> 33:55.160
just throwing a door into the wall.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.280
Yeah, exactly.

33:58.720 --> 34:00.320
What'd you do that for, Clark?

34:01.320 --> 34:02.400
No, this is great, this is great.

34:02.400 --> 34:05.560
I'm glad you guys are succeeding, I guess.

34:05.560 --> 34:08.960
That, I mean, yeah, you've never seen Jon's eyes so big

34:08.960 --> 34:12.300
and he's just staring at Clark in disbelief.

34:12.300 --> 34:16.360
As this door flies through this little door-sized slot

34:16.360 --> 34:21.360
in the wall and begins making its way down to the water

34:22.240 --> 34:27.240
under Keith Vigna, Jack Russell is going to roll a naught 7

34:28.280 --> 34:31.680
and he grabs on directly next to,

34:31.680 --> 34:36.680
it's like we get another shot of what just happened

34:37.360 --> 34:39.440
of the three men running and jumping

34:39.440 --> 34:43.560
where Keith goes, hits, falls, and immediately,

34:43.560 --> 34:45.660
Don grabs, and then immediately,

34:45.660 --> 34:48.080
Jack Russell grabs right next to Don

34:48.080 --> 34:51.660
and so the two of them are hanging from this railing.

34:51.660 --> 34:54.420
Jack Russell is just pulling himself up,

34:54.420 --> 34:57.440
going, oh, this is fucking shit.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.520
And he's trying to pull himself up

34:59.520 --> 35:03.760
and Don is a chancy, chancy boy.

35:03.760 --> 35:07.380
Below the ball, you see these two twins,

35:07.380 --> 35:11.000
one with a bowl cut, the other one with a pig tail.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.960
They're running overalls.

35:13.240 --> 35:17.560
And each of them has a massive smile on their face

35:17.560 --> 35:22.560
and they reach into their little pockets in their overalls

35:23.280 --> 35:25.860
and they each pull out a lollipop.

35:28.940 --> 35:30.720
I think I just pissed myself.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.280
That was scary.

35:38.220 --> 35:39.680
Can you imagine?

35:39.720 --> 35:44.360
Behind the ball, it's tendrils finding support

35:44.360 --> 35:49.360
in the silvery, shimmery sea,

35:49.480 --> 35:50.680
making this weird like,

35:54.960 --> 35:59.960
noise is going to fling some of the melting steel

36:00.300 --> 36:02.020
with one of its tendrils.

36:02.020 --> 36:03.840
It's going to splash.

36:05.240 --> 36:08.920
And it rolled a 23, like Michael Jordan.

36:09.040 --> 36:11.600
You'd never wanted to get in the pool with Michael,

36:11.600 --> 36:13.560
all time greatest splasher.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.920
He could do the thing where he puts his hands

36:16.920 --> 36:19.400
and squeezes them and it shoots right at your face.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.800
You know what I'm talking about?

36:21.800 --> 36:24.440
I do, my dad did that shit all the time.

36:24.440 --> 36:27.140
Michael Jordan was the Scottie Pippen of doing that.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.880
The splash is timed perfectly.

36:32.880 --> 36:37.320
And this door made out of this black texture,

36:37.320 --> 36:41.200
this colorful black texture flying perfectly

36:41.200 --> 36:43.600
through the air to save Keith Vigna

36:43.600 --> 36:48.600
from falling into this metal gets completely engulfed.

36:49.080 --> 36:54.080
This melting steel wraps itself around this door

36:55.240 --> 36:59.680
and it is no longer the liquid that it was previously.

36:59.680 --> 37:04.680
It is now a metal door and the metal door falls,

37:05.480 --> 37:10.480
hits the ocean and begins sinking as Keith Vigna falls.

37:15.280 --> 37:20.280
Keith, your feet hit first.

37:21.700 --> 37:23.480
I was going to say, is there any way

37:23.480 --> 37:26.000
that my cargo shorts could act as parachutes

37:26.000 --> 37:28.160
in this crazy world we're in right now

37:29.320 --> 37:31.880
to slow my fall just a little bit?

37:32.840 --> 37:35.620
In this crazy messed up world we're in.

37:36.780 --> 37:38.840
He can't tell if that's better than the fact

37:38.840 --> 37:40.340
that he was about to kill you.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.580
Let's take a vote, Joe, Thomas, Justin.

37:44.580 --> 37:47.920
If the cargo shorts can become parachutes.

37:47.920 --> 37:51.520
I'll close my eyes so that I don't know who voted for what.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.280
Yeah, put a thumbs up.

37:53.280 --> 37:56.520
Put a thumbs up if you think that Keith touches down

37:56.520 --> 38:01.360
into the metal sea and put a thumbs down

38:01.720 --> 38:04.360
if you think parachute shorts.

38:04.360 --> 38:05.800
All right, it's been decided.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.960
Keith, your feet touch first.

38:09.960 --> 38:10.800
Okay.

38:16.920 --> 38:21.920
The pain is unimaginable.

38:22.360 --> 38:25.560
It is the hottest.

38:25.560 --> 38:29.240
It's giving off no temperature change to the air around it

38:29.240 --> 38:34.240
but as your toes dip in, you can't feel anything at all

38:36.440 --> 38:38.360
and your mind goes completely numb

38:38.360 --> 38:41.520
and there's just this piercing noise

38:41.520 --> 38:43.880
going through the back of your head, just this.

38:54.040 --> 38:59.040
The shock immediately changes as the rest of you

38:59.480 --> 39:04.480
slowly, slowly, agonizingly melts into this ocean.

39:06.720 --> 39:11.720
Up to your knees now, your shins are fully melting.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.040
You don't even know what it would be like

39:14.040 --> 39:17.440
inside of your shorts but you think your legs

39:17.440 --> 39:19.800
might just not even exist anymore.

39:19.800 --> 39:23.400
You're just becoming part of this ocean itself

39:23.400 --> 39:25.560
and your stomach hurts.

39:25.560 --> 39:29.680
Your mouth immediately has the taste of metal

39:29.680 --> 39:32.160
inside of it, blood and metal

39:32.160 --> 39:35.640
and you can smell butter.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.320
Smells like butter?

39:37.320 --> 39:38.680
That's weird.

39:38.680 --> 39:43.680
What do you scream out as your torso begins?

39:43.880 --> 39:45.840
Don, use the phone on me!

39:49.320 --> 39:50.600
Fuck yeah.

39:50.600 --> 39:55.600
And you will continue melting in on your next turn

39:55.840 --> 39:58.280
and by the end of your next turn,

39:58.280 --> 40:03.280
you will be fully submerged in the shimmering silver sea.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.280
Clark Bishop, it's your turn.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.680
Clark Bishop, come on down.

40:08.680 --> 40:10.920
Everything going good out there?

40:10.920 --> 40:12.800
Did he land on the door?

40:12.800 --> 40:15.080
That was good timing with you opening up that.

40:16.360 --> 40:17.200
We got him, right?

40:17.200 --> 40:20.000
You know, mission accomplished.

40:21.000 --> 40:21.840
Yeah.

40:21.840 --> 40:22.680
High five me, man.

40:22.680 --> 40:25.640
John, weekly high fives you.

40:25.640 --> 40:26.480
Every week?

40:28.000 --> 40:29.840
This is our weekly high five.

40:29.840 --> 40:33.880
It may or may not be about what just happened with Keith,

40:33.880 --> 40:36.440
which may or may not have been successful.

40:37.640 --> 40:41.520
I may or may not have just seen one of the most

40:41.520 --> 40:44.160
horrific things I could ever hope to imagine

40:44.160 --> 40:47.520
as he may or may not have melted into the ocean.

40:47.520 --> 40:50.000
And Keith is just screaming at the top of his lungs

40:50.040 --> 40:53.440
until it gets to his lungs and then it's just gurgles.

40:53.440 --> 40:56.280
Keith, everyone knows you're in over your head,

40:56.280 --> 40:57.520
over your head.

41:00.880 --> 41:03.440
See, he's so excited that he got caught by the door.

41:03.440 --> 41:04.280
He's so excited.

41:04.280 --> 41:05.640
He's screaming for joy, right?

41:07.080 --> 41:10.280
Clark, at the end of the day, it was a great throw.

41:10.280 --> 41:13.400
You did your bit as good as anyone could have asked you,

41:13.400 --> 41:15.880
but unforeseen circumstances came up

41:15.880 --> 41:19.680
and now he's being swallowed into that goo there.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.160
I can smell him cooking from here, actually.

41:22.160 --> 41:25.080
Is that what that butter toast thing is?

41:25.080 --> 41:28.760
Yeah, yeah, that's his blubber.

41:29.640 --> 41:32.080
He was, you know, he was an inside boy.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.040
Not fat, but certainly not fit.

41:37.760 --> 41:38.800
Can we do anything?

41:39.960 --> 41:41.440
Are you telling me that Keith's dead?

41:41.440 --> 41:43.080
No, you can look out the hole.

41:43.080 --> 41:45.440
You can see him dying out there and screaming.

41:45.440 --> 41:49.200
This is still your turn.

41:49.200 --> 41:52.320
So any idea you have is as good as.

41:52.320 --> 41:53.160
We still got time.

41:53.160 --> 41:54.640
We still got time.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.720
Clark is going to search through this magical room

41:56.720 --> 41:58.240
one more time for something long

41:58.240 --> 42:01.520
that he can throw out there to maybe pull him in with.

42:03.360 --> 42:04.480
You find a door.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.760
I've been looking through this room to find helpful things.

42:10.760 --> 42:12.560
God damn it, I can't find anything.

42:12.560 --> 42:13.480
It's an 82.

42:15.680 --> 42:18.280
There's so much junk in here, but it's also useless.

42:18.280 --> 42:19.560
You find a putter.

42:20.400 --> 42:21.240
How about this?

42:21.240 --> 42:22.080
How about this?

42:22.080 --> 42:22.920
A putter.

42:22.920 --> 42:23.760
Is it long enough?

42:23.760 --> 42:24.960
You just whang him on the head.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.280
Just hit him in the head.

42:27.280 --> 42:28.800
Don, use the owl.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.160
Phone on me.

42:33.360 --> 42:34.640
All right, good turn.

42:34.640 --> 42:35.960
Don D. Pettymore.

42:38.280 --> 42:41.800
Don is going to continue his chant.

42:41.800 --> 42:43.360
Can you give me that one more time?

42:43.360 --> 42:48.360
Biza girl, biza girl, biza girl.

42:48.880 --> 42:50.000
That was three times.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.280
Cause you're special to me.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.480
Thanks number 17.

42:54.480 --> 42:55.320
Damn it.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.720
I don't have 17 friends.

43:04.720 --> 43:05.840
All right, and so.

43:05.840 --> 43:07.960
Yeah, you were all fools to worry.

43:07.960 --> 43:12.960
So, Don is hanging.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.800
And as he's hanging, his chant begins reverberating

43:18.800 --> 43:22.040
through this entire place.

43:28.040 --> 43:32.720
You all feel yourselves freeze,

43:32.720 --> 43:36.440
both in space and in time.

43:38.400 --> 43:43.400
As the world begins to rewind.

43:43.440 --> 43:44.400
Oh my God.

43:44.400 --> 43:48.480
You feel yourselves moving backwards,

43:48.480 --> 43:50.840
making the exact same movements,

43:50.840 --> 43:53.960
only this time in reverse.

43:53.960 --> 43:56.320
Clark sets a putter down on the floor

43:56.320 --> 43:58.280
in the piston bunk yard.

43:58.280 --> 44:00.280
Keith screams out.

44:01.800 --> 44:04.120
His legs exist once again.

44:04.120 --> 44:05.800
His stomach is content.

44:05.800 --> 44:08.480
The taste of blood in his mouth vanishes

44:08.480 --> 44:11.800
and the smell of butter melts away.

44:11.800 --> 44:16.200
His feet lift up out of the endless ocean of pain

44:16.200 --> 44:18.520
and the shock dissipates.

44:18.520 --> 44:20.480
A shiny metal door emerges

44:20.480 --> 44:22.520
from out of the shimmering silver sea

44:22.520 --> 44:24.600
and flings off its steel covering

44:24.600 --> 44:27.560
to reveal a colorful black texture.

44:27.560 --> 44:30.880
The little twins put lollipops back in their wrappers

44:30.880 --> 44:32.600
and into their overalls.

44:32.600 --> 44:36.960
The unnaturally hued door sends a spray of liquid metal

44:36.960 --> 44:40.200
toward the feral ball that inhabited Julie Maxwell

44:40.200 --> 44:43.560
and then flies back up into the junkyard bunker

44:43.560 --> 44:48.240
just as John closes a hem made hole in the wall.

44:48.240 --> 44:51.800
Clark catches the door and promptly places it

44:51.800 --> 44:53.880
under some junk on the floor.

44:53.880 --> 44:58.160
Keith's body ascends toward the second stilted bunkers hatch

44:58.160 --> 45:00.400
and his sweaty hands grab

45:00.400 --> 45:02.720
and immediately release the railing

45:02.720 --> 45:07.160
as he is thrust backwards onto the rising bridge

45:07.160 --> 45:10.280
and time freezes once again

45:10.280 --> 45:12.800
before suddenly stumbling forward

45:12.800 --> 45:15.080
in its typical intoxicated manner

45:15.080 --> 45:17.440
and Keith leaps toward the hatch,

45:17.440 --> 45:19.800
reaches out for the railing

45:19.800 --> 45:23.880
and we'll hear that roll on the next episode.

45:23.880 --> 45:24.720
Woo.

45:24.720 --> 45:26.160
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

45:28.200 --> 45:29.040
I fail.

45:29.040 --> 45:31.200
Oh well then it just happens again.

45:31.200 --> 45:32.040
Okay.

45:32.040 --> 45:33.440
Oh should I crit fail?

45:34.640 --> 45:37.360
It was a 48 on a 60 just so you know.

45:38.360 --> 45:39.520
Oh then we learn now.

45:40.800 --> 45:43.400
I thought you were just gonna end it right there.

45:43.400 --> 45:47.720
Keith grabs onto the hatch, opens it, grabs the phone,

45:47.720 --> 45:51.480
saves everyone in the world and podcasts over.

45:52.720 --> 45:53.560
I'm glad you wrote that.

45:53.560 --> 45:54.400
Thank you very much.

45:54.400 --> 45:55.220
That's the end.

45:55.220 --> 45:56.060
Good game.

45:56.060 --> 45:56.880
That was wild.

45:56.880 --> 45:57.720
That was a great ending.

45:57.720 --> 45:58.560
Good round.

45:58.920 --> 46:00.160
You guys wanna play again?

46:01.600 --> 46:02.440
I do.

46:02.440 --> 46:04.560
Like you mean like season two?

46:04.560 --> 46:06.400
What if we just played this again?

46:06.400 --> 46:07.600
Let's just do this again.

46:07.600 --> 46:08.440
Let's just start.

46:08.440 --> 46:10.560
I bet you guys would do better.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.080
Oh yeah.

46:12.080 --> 46:14.120
Fucking right off the bat.

46:14.120 --> 46:15.960
Maggie, it's your birthday.

46:15.960 --> 46:17.400
You're under arrest.

46:17.400 --> 46:20.400
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

46:20.400 --> 46:25.400
["Livin' In"]

46:50.400 --> 46:55.400
["Livin' In"]

47:20.400 --> 47:25.400
["Livin' In"]
