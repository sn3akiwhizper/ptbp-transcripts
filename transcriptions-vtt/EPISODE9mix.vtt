00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
Hello to all my friends and all my enemies, it's your boy Wolf the Dog growling at you

00:06.320 --> 00:12.420
from Contention's best radio station, 694.2 PTBP.

00:12.420 --> 00:17.200
It's time for our first segment, the unveiling of Howlin' with Wolf, where we get to hear

00:17.200 --> 00:21.600
from y'all, my pups, my babies, my children.

00:21.600 --> 00:27.540
I'm only doing this out of the love in my big ole wolf heart, sharing airtime, fuck,

00:27.540 --> 00:29.460
but my pups are that important.

00:29.460 --> 00:33.100
Alright let's kick it off with this one from an anonymous listener.

00:33.100 --> 00:36.340
Dear V-cell, do not enter the mirror room.

00:36.340 --> 00:39.560
Do not let John enter the mirror room.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.500
Destroy the mirror room.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.340
Destroy Orotech.

00:43.340 --> 00:45.020
Destroy John.

00:45.020 --> 00:46.540
Destroy the world.

00:46.540 --> 00:50.140
Dear V-cell, nothing is real and everything is alive.

00:50.140 --> 00:53.260
The end has come and will come and come again.

00:53.260 --> 00:55.300
Find my bones, hear it and see.

00:55.300 --> 00:56.660
No, wait for me.

00:56.660 --> 00:59.780
I'm coming, but time moves so slowly.

00:59.780 --> 01:06.140
Wow, uh, that's uh, that's real something y'all.

01:06.140 --> 01:11.220
So if you want me to read whatever crazy horseshit you gotta say, submit a 5 star review on your

01:11.220 --> 01:17.880
podcast app, screenshot that shit and send it to us, or tag us on social media, at pretending

01:17.880 --> 01:22.880
pod on instagram and twitter, pretending to be people on facebook.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.780
Now let's hear some news y'all.

01:24.780 --> 01:29.840
Last time, the roving gang of tunnel vision cops left Mildred Mitchell, sans granddaughter

01:29.840 --> 01:31.620
and information.

01:31.620 --> 01:36.020
They went to Forgotten Treasures and bullied the nice lady there until she put her own

01:36.020 --> 01:40.660
life in danger by telling the cops about the drunk man who threatened her.

01:40.660 --> 01:45.660
Upon leaving, the white Toyota they'd been searching for peeled out onto the road.

01:45.660 --> 01:51.860
After a short, dangerous pursuit, Keith Vigna gunned down Charles Donovan and John Lee Pettymore

01:51.860 --> 01:56.900
fired warning shots into the air as well as Clark's tires, and they found a bald man

01:56.900 --> 01:58.580
tied up in that old trunk.

01:58.580 --> 02:01.500
I'm surprised they didn't shoot this old boy too.

02:01.500 --> 02:07.300
Keith is riding with the bald man to the clinic as he is unconscious and in critical condition.

02:07.300 --> 02:11.860
Wolf wants his pack to keep this old boy in your singing bowls.

02:11.860 --> 02:20.860
Now rub your hands together so fast it makes a weird sound for kudzu with no backbone.

02:20.860 --> 02:44.780
Is he still bound in that chain?

02:44.780 --> 02:47.820
I'm gonna try to take the chain off and put like actual handcuffs on him.

02:47.820 --> 02:48.820
Okay good.

02:48.820 --> 02:49.820
Zip tie.

02:49.820 --> 02:50.820
Citizen's arrest style.

02:50.820 --> 02:52.820
You can never break the chain.

02:52.820 --> 02:56.700
Alright Keith you are in the ambulance.

02:56.700 --> 03:03.620
You have replaced Billy Harrison's chain with handcuffs and you guys are heading to the

03:03.620 --> 03:04.620
clinic.

03:04.620 --> 03:09.860
I want to ask one of the paramedics back there, hey is there anything you know maybe for this

03:09.860 --> 03:14.940
pain in my foot so maybe I can I know I'm supposed to keep off of it but you know in

03:14.940 --> 03:17.800
case I ever need to be on it like stay in the pain.

03:17.800 --> 03:21.320
No pun intended.

03:21.320 --> 03:26.360
I don't I don't know if I'm supposed to just give out medication.

03:26.360 --> 03:27.520
Who's gonna get you in trouble?

03:27.520 --> 03:29.960
I'm a police officer.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.200
I'm gonna get you in trouble.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.200
I'm a police officer.

03:33.200 --> 03:36.040
Gotcha bitch.

03:36.040 --> 03:41.880
Are you saying this to a terrified like 19 year old EMT?

03:41.880 --> 03:43.360
Roll Persuade.

03:43.360 --> 03:44.360
Nice.

03:44.360 --> 03:47.480
13 on a 70.

03:47.480 --> 03:50.560
Oh my god.

03:50.560 --> 03:54.080
Um yeah okay just uh.

03:54.080 --> 03:58.920
Shh this is our secret.

03:58.920 --> 04:03.600
Like the crazed look in your eye right now is like you actually are like intimidating

04:03.600 --> 04:05.680
some of your drugs.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.160
You look so scary.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.800
Yeah I guess you could.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.880
And he reaches into a bag of pills.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.800
Yeah he just pulls out a handful.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.800
He's like take one to four of these.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.120
What did they do?

04:20.120 --> 04:24.000
Roll a D4 and see how many you take.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I take D6 again.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.560
I'm a cheater.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.560
Take one.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.360
I take one.

04:32.360 --> 04:33.360
What does it do?

04:33.360 --> 04:36.640
It's not effective when you take one.

04:36.640 --> 04:37.640
It's Oxycontin.

04:37.640 --> 04:41.680
He just gives you like a bottle full of Oxycontin.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.600
Can I want to ask you if I take these?

04:43.600 --> 04:47.800
I'm thinking I probably get a plus to something and a minus to something if I take one.

04:47.800 --> 04:48.800
Yeah.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.760
Can you tell me what that is right now before I take one?

04:51.760 --> 04:55.760
So your trap rap game is now off the hook.

04:55.760 --> 05:00.600
I am the least knowledgeable about prescription drugs but if he's actually in pain won't it

05:00.600 --> 05:02.720
do good more than it does detriment?

05:02.720 --> 05:04.040
Like it'll attack pain receptors?

05:04.040 --> 05:06.760
It'll do more good for the pain than...

05:06.760 --> 05:07.760
But I don't think...

05:07.760 --> 05:08.760
But he's gonna be...

05:08.760 --> 05:09.760
Like he's not using it recreationally.

05:09.760 --> 05:10.760
I'm gonna be on Oxycontin.

05:10.760 --> 05:16.520
He's gonna be like every housewife you know but don't realize.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.440
They're all so happy.

05:18.440 --> 05:19.440
Fake happy.

05:19.440 --> 05:20.720
Who does that?

05:20.720 --> 05:21.720
Fake happy.

05:21.720 --> 05:22.720
Don't worry.

05:22.720 --> 05:23.720
Oh shit.

05:23.720 --> 05:24.720
Fake happy.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.680
Okay I'm looking up the side effects of Oxycontin.

05:27.680 --> 05:28.680
Like you'll be loopy right?

05:28.680 --> 05:29.680
Yeah you'll be a bit loopy.

05:29.680 --> 05:30.680
You'll be a little scratchy.

05:30.680 --> 05:33.280
Kind of a little bit of a goof.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.280
And maybe sleepy.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.680
I mean like if I take like one...

05:36.680 --> 05:38.680
Fake happy is by Paramore.

05:38.680 --> 05:39.680
Okay.

05:39.680 --> 05:40.680
Awesome.

05:40.680 --> 05:50.400
Common side effects of Oxycontin include constipation, nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, vomiting,

05:50.400 --> 05:54.960
sleepiness, tiredness, drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, itching, headache,

05:54.960 --> 05:58.200
dry mouth, sweating, and decreases the ability to feel pain.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.040
Ask your doctor if you want some.

06:00.400 --> 06:08.520
Okay I'll keep these for later but I'm probably gonna take them all the time sparingly.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.240
Alright Clark and John what do you guys want to do?

06:11.240 --> 06:13.920
Check out Dr. Marie Jacobs.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.680
See where she fits into this mystery.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.840
What was the doctor's scrubs we got?

06:17.840 --> 06:18.840
Zaboomafoo?

06:18.840 --> 06:19.840
Zabrowski.

06:19.840 --> 06:20.840
Dr. Zaboomafoo.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.480
Doctor between the lions.

06:22.480 --> 06:26.660
Dr. Marie Jacobs was she in contention or was she in the city?

06:26.660 --> 06:27.660
She's in contention.

06:27.660 --> 06:28.660
Do I know her?

06:28.660 --> 06:29.660
Have I heard of her?

06:30.280 --> 06:31.280
Do I know anything about her?

06:31.280 --> 06:33.280
She's Clark's ex-wife.

06:33.280 --> 06:37.780
No you probably wouldn't have any reason to know her.

06:37.780 --> 06:42.100
She's got a private practice and that's all you know about her.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.760
Family practitioner.

06:43.760 --> 06:50.620
You do have an address and she lives in the suburbs which is in the northeast part of

06:50.620 --> 06:51.620
town.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.100
Are you taking both vehicles there?

06:54.100 --> 06:55.100
Probably yeah.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.100
Let's get a burger first.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.100
Okay.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.100
What is the burger place called?

06:58.100 --> 06:59.100
Burgatory?

06:59.540 --> 07:02.380
It's on the other side of the highway.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.540
It's like five minutes out of your way if you want to hop up there and grab a burger.

07:05.540 --> 07:06.540
Yeah.

07:06.540 --> 07:07.540
Yeah.

07:07.540 --> 07:12.060
I kind of need a, you know, in the salon I work you can't take like too many mental

07:12.060 --> 07:16.300
health days off, but I need a mental health hour after watching Charles explode all over

07:16.300 --> 07:17.300
that work.

07:17.300 --> 07:18.300
For sure.

07:18.300 --> 07:19.300
Frosty root beer.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.300
That might soak me all right.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.300
All right.

07:21.300 --> 07:28.400
So you guys grab some grub and then you head down back into town into the, yeah.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.400
Number one.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.400
Burger.

07:30.400 --> 07:33.200
Oh, I'll have that.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.840
Number two.

07:34.840 --> 07:35.840
Vegan burger.

07:35.840 --> 07:36.840
We have a vegan burger.

07:36.840 --> 07:37.840
Absolutely not that.

07:37.840 --> 07:38.840
Yeah.

07:38.840 --> 07:39.840
I already ordered some.

07:39.840 --> 07:40.840
I'm not reading anymore.

07:40.840 --> 07:41.840
Number three.

07:41.840 --> 07:42.840
Oh, I don't want to even hear this.

07:42.840 --> 07:43.840
Yeah.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.840
I'm editing all that up.

07:45.840 --> 07:52.160
I remember when we ordered waffle house for 30 minutes.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.000
Do they really not have pancakes at waffle house?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
No.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
No, they don't.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
That's fucking crazy.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.200
I just kept trying to order pancakes.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.200
It makes sense though.

08:00.200 --> 08:03.960
They don't like covered in some other for your browns and capped.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.160
Capped is what Charles is now.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.160
He's covered in mushrooms.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.160
He's covered in mushrooms.

08:09.160 --> 08:15.520
Well, eventually he would be since we probably buried him on the side of the roof.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.360
Does Dr. Marie Jacobs run her practice out of her home?

08:18.360 --> 08:19.360
No.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.360
Is it midday?

08:20.360 --> 08:21.360
Will she be at the clinic?

08:21.360 --> 08:24.160
I feel like we should go to go to her wherever she is.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.360
No, that like the sun just went down.

08:26.360 --> 08:27.360
Okay.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.360
Then yeah, we'll head to her house.

08:28.360 --> 08:33.920
On the way to Dr. Marie Jacobs home, you guys pull onto our street in the suburbs.

08:33.920 --> 08:39.200
And as you are going down the street, you see kind of off to the right.

08:39.200 --> 08:44.520
There's a man with extremely unkempt hair and facial hair standing in his front yard,

08:44.520 --> 08:49.560
wearing a white tank top under some like rubber looking waders.

08:49.560 --> 08:56.120
And he is messing with a vacuum, holding the hose with one hand and pointing the wand like

08:56.520 --> 09:02.080
of the vacuum cleaner to the ground, kind of like he's challenging his yard to a duel.

09:02.080 --> 09:07.640
And he begins to hold the wand with both hands and his arms shake violently up and down and

09:07.640 --> 09:13.080
all around before he drops the vacuum wand and begins sprinting out into the street in

09:13.080 --> 09:17.040
front of your car, not even paying attention to you whatsoever.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.040
What do you want to do?

09:18.040 --> 09:21.400
I was texting, so I just run him down.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.200
Did you say, did you say it was vacuum like or it was a vacuum?

09:24.200 --> 09:25.200
It was a vacuum.

09:25.280 --> 09:29.240
I was messing with that like hose wand thing that comes off the side.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.560
And it doesn't look like a fucked up vacuum.

09:31.560 --> 09:32.560
It's just a normal vacuum.

09:32.560 --> 09:33.560
No, normal vacuum.

09:33.560 --> 09:36.520
I wrote down disheveled man vacuuming his yard, so let's just keep going.

09:36.520 --> 09:37.520
Okay.

09:37.520 --> 09:38.520
Yeah.

09:38.520 --> 09:43.600
So yeah, I slam on the brakes and I say, sir, this might sound crazy, but were you trying

09:43.600 --> 09:47.440
to vacuum an oil creature out of this guy?

09:47.440 --> 09:49.160
He's like running away.

09:49.160 --> 09:52.240
He has not even paid any attention to you whatsoever.

09:52.280 --> 09:57.600
As you slammed on the brakes, he begins running down the street as he's running.

09:57.600 --> 10:04.320
He begins to float off the ground and his legs are still flailing in a desperate gate

10:04.320 --> 10:05.320
roll sanity.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.160
Man, you really don't want us to see Marie Jacobs.

10:08.160 --> 10:16.520
I pass nine on a 52 47 on a 53 neither one of you lose any sanity.

10:16.520 --> 10:21.640
Basically you think maybe it's the air currents from the,

10:22.040 --> 10:23.040
he must be a Poppins.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.040
Yeah.

10:24.040 --> 10:30.360
Perhaps he has jumped very high, but what you do see is a young boy and girl standing

10:30.360 --> 10:33.720
in their front yard across the street and their jaws are dropped.

10:33.720 --> 10:41.760
They failed the rules hard and they are watching this dude as he begins to float into the air.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.400
So what do you do?

10:44.400 --> 10:45.680
How far in the air is he?

10:45.680 --> 10:46.680
Two feet.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.080
Like I run up and I try to pull him back down.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.080
Okay.

10:50.080 --> 10:54.200
Is not coming down.

10:54.200 --> 10:58.440
You are actively fighting against a force that you cannot see Clark.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.440
What do you do?

10:59.440 --> 11:06.600
I grabbed the other leg, his pants fall down.

11:06.600 --> 11:17.320
So I need you guys to both a roll strength pass 23 on a 65 fail 76 on a 50 John, you

11:17.320 --> 11:20.760
lose grip and slide down his leg.

11:20.760 --> 11:26.600
As you are pulling on his shoe, as he kind of begins to get higher, you pull a shoe off

11:26.600 --> 11:33.480
of his foot and Clark, you are holding him, but you feel a force actively lifting him

11:33.480 --> 11:34.480
upward.

11:34.480 --> 11:37.440
He is three feet off the ground at this point.

11:37.440 --> 11:41.640
And you are the only thing holding him from floating away.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.040
And he is screaming.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.040
Oh, Holy.

11:44.040 --> 11:50.360
Oh, you have to, you have to get the, get the, get the shit, get the fucking, get the

11:50.360 --> 11:52.360
vacuum, get the vacuum.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.360
I turned to John.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.360
John, get the vacuum.

11:54.360 --> 11:55.360
He says, get the vacuum.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.080
I turned to those kids across the street.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.080
Kids get the vacuum.

11:58.080 --> 12:03.680
The two kids run and grab the vacuum from this man's yard.

12:03.680 --> 12:09.160
I'm kind of like, I'm overseeing the children now I'm as I'm in a supervisory role.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.160
Yeah.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.280
I mean, you're delegating right there, right there.

12:13.920 --> 12:24.280
And, uh, these two children, uh, are running over with the vacuum on an extension cord

12:24.280 --> 12:28.400
that is like extremely long and they're bringing it out into the street.

12:28.400 --> 12:36.560
Clark, I need you to roll strength for me one more time here, 46 on a 65 while I'm holding

12:36.560 --> 12:37.560
onto them.

12:37.560 --> 12:38.560
We got, we got you, bud.

12:38.560 --> 12:39.560
They're coming with the vacuum.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.080
Get the, get my feet, my feet, it's all around.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.080
It's all around.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.280
It's everywhere.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.280
What is it bud?

12:46.280 --> 12:47.280
What is it?

12:47.280 --> 12:55.440
And these kids bring the vacuum to you, John suck, suck those feet up right there.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.040
Just put that hose to his feet.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.040
You two are heroes.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.520
How old are these children?

13:01.520 --> 13:03.200
They're like nine.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.200
Both of them.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.200
Yeah.

13:05.200 --> 13:12.240
So the girl is holding the wand and the little boy is holding the vacuum, like hugging it,

13:12.240 --> 13:13.240
like holding it up.

13:13.240 --> 13:15.200
And he reaches over and flicks it on.

13:15.200 --> 13:21.520
And the girl holds the one kind of up to this man's feet and they're both like, yeah, what

13:21.520 --> 13:22.520
do we do?

13:22.520 --> 13:24.000
You're doing great kids.

13:24.000 --> 13:32.240
But is this, why, why is how you stop people from flying now?

13:32.240 --> 13:33.240
Keep going.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.800
I'm making you both honorary deputies.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.160
You're vacuuming the hell out of that.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.160
This man's shoes.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.160
Just keep going.

13:39.160 --> 13:44.880
Do we have fake badges at the police station?

13:44.880 --> 13:46.600
I was already thinking that I've got them in my car.

13:46.600 --> 13:50.240
I've got little that I hand out to kids.

13:50.240 --> 13:53.520
The wand starts to move in jagged motions.

13:53.520 --> 13:56.440
Oh my God, there's something.

13:56.440 --> 13:59.440
I'm sucking up something.

14:03.640 --> 14:04.640
No.

14:04.640 --> 14:05.640
No, yeah.

14:05.640 --> 14:06.640
I can't do this.

14:06.640 --> 14:13.840
I think it was worse with the hand gestures, but it might play better on audio.

14:13.840 --> 14:19.640
But that was, uh, yeah, John, John very quickly like grabs the end of the hose and was like,

14:19.640 --> 14:20.640
you're doing great.

14:20.640 --> 14:23.840
I got that from here.

14:23.840 --> 14:29.640
The boy holding the vacuum is like, I can feel it too.

14:29.640 --> 14:31.640
It's inside now.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.240
What are you?

14:35.240 --> 14:36.240
What are your names?

14:36.240 --> 14:37.240
I'm Aiden.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.240
Aiden.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.240
I'm Aiden.

14:39.240 --> 14:42.240
And she's, I don't know.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.240
Like yeah.

14:43.240 --> 14:44.240
Brooke.

14:44.240 --> 14:45.240
No.

14:45.240 --> 14:46.240
Brooke is a decent.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.240
What's like a millennial's kid's name.

14:48.240 --> 14:51.240
Kids in contention probably still have good biblical names.

14:51.240 --> 14:52.240
Yeah.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.240
They're, they're not worried about their names right now.

14:54.240 --> 14:55.240
Yeah.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.240
They are.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.240
Cutback.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.240
Cutback.

14:58.240 --> 15:05.640
Clark, you actually feel the pressure is releasing and it is easier to hold this guy closer to

15:05.640 --> 15:06.640
the ground.

15:06.640 --> 15:07.640
And he is looking down.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.640
He's like, you're doing it.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.740
Oh, you're doing it.

15:11.740 --> 15:16.240
Clark is feeling really good about being able to pull him down.

15:16.240 --> 15:17.240
I'm strong.

15:17.240 --> 15:21.240
John is watching all this like hands on hip satisfied like, yes, team.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.240
Yes.

15:22.240 --> 15:25.240
Clark, you get him all the way to the ground and he just begins sprinting.

15:25.240 --> 15:26.240
He is sprinting.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.240
He's like, run.

15:27.240 --> 15:28.240
Run.

15:28.240 --> 15:29.240
Run away.

15:29.240 --> 15:30.240
Run.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.240
Can I do a check that I don't let him go?

15:32.240 --> 15:33.240
Yeah, absolutely.

15:33.240 --> 15:35.240
You can roll strength or unarmed combat.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.240
I'm using my unarmed combat skill.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.240
Okay.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.240
I pass.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.240
53 on a 70.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.240
He rolled an aught.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.240
Aught.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.240
It's a critical fail.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.240
It's a critical fail.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.240
His legs fall.

15:45.240 --> 15:49.240
So you can do whatever you want to him.

15:49.240 --> 15:56.240
I want to grab him, like bear around the shoulders and pull him to like the nearest lawn.

15:56.240 --> 16:00.240
I just want to get him away from that area that he was floating in and off the road.

16:00.240 --> 16:04.240
And then if he's still struggling, I want to get him to the ground.

16:04.240 --> 16:09.240
Okay, yeah, you can get him to the ground and you're holding him and he's still screaming

16:09.240 --> 16:11.240
like, get away from me.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.240
Get away.

16:12.240 --> 16:16.240
Now I need both of you guys to roll sanity for me.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.240
Fail.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.240
62 on a 53.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.240
61 on a 52.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.240
I also fail.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.240
You guys are both going to lose a D4.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.240
Oh, fuck.

16:27.240 --> 16:28.240
Four.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.240
Two.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.240
So my sanity is now at 50.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.240
Mine's at 49 and I'm one away from my breaking point.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.240
I am two away from mine.

16:36.240 --> 16:43.240
You guys can actually see on the street where you were, flashing in your vision is a thin

16:43.240 --> 16:48.240
layer of this viscous, like writhing ooze.

16:48.240 --> 16:54.240
And it is moving down the street into one of those drainage.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.240
Storm drain.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.240
Yeah.

16:56.240 --> 16:59.240
Off the side of the road where the sidewalk meets.

16:59.240 --> 17:04.240
And all of the ooze that was on the street is going down that drain.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.240
What happens when you shoot it?

17:05.240 --> 17:07.240
I shoot it.

17:07.240 --> 17:08.240
Okay.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.240
Kids, get out of the way.

17:10.240 --> 17:13.240
And roll firearms.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.240
67 on a 60.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.240
Okay, so you just fire a few shots.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.240
Those kids are dead.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.240
I told them to get out of the way.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.240
The kids both like completely-

17:22.240 --> 17:25.240
Probably think it's pretty cool to see a cop she's killing, right?

17:25.240 --> 17:28.240
They're completely blank faced and they're backing away.

17:28.240 --> 17:31.240
The boy is still holding the vacuum.

17:31.240 --> 17:34.240
Hey, junior deputies, get back here.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.240
Drop that vacuum, first of all.

17:35.240 --> 17:39.240
And as the two of them are being talked to by you,

17:39.240 --> 17:44.240
you see the bag on this vacuum just explodes.

17:44.240 --> 17:51.240
And you see both of these kids are immediately just covered in this black viscous goo.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.240
They are gone.

17:53.240 --> 17:59.240
Not necessarily from your vision because you can currently see this mass of ooze.

17:59.240 --> 18:08.240
So more so you see the limbs of these kids inside of this ooze struggling to get out.

18:08.240 --> 18:14.240
God, I mean it's so dark that it seems to dampen the brightness of everything around it,

18:14.240 --> 18:16.240
all the lights shining down and stuff.

18:16.240 --> 18:24.240
And it kind of melts down into the ground and begins slowly at first,

18:24.240 --> 18:27.240
but surely gaining speed flowing toward you, John.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.240
What do you do?

18:28.240 --> 18:32.240
Do kids count as one kill or half a kill?

18:32.240 --> 18:35.240
John just got two kills.

18:35.240 --> 18:39.240
Also go ahead and roll sanity.

18:39.240 --> 18:43.240
No way. Yeah, 92 on a 49.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.240
So this is going to be a breaking point moment.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.240
I critically fail.

18:47.240 --> 18:49.240
66.

18:49.240 --> 18:53.240
John, roll a D6, cut it in half and add four.

18:53.240 --> 18:56.240
Oh, fuck.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.240
Okay, cool.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.240
Five.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.240
Clark, you lose seven.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.240
So that's a breaking point for me.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.240
Same.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.240
Also, man, I am bonkers now.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.240
What are you down to?

19:05.240 --> 19:06.240
44.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.240
That's not too bad.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.240
I have 40.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.240
I'm at 43.

19:09.240 --> 19:10.240
I'm fucking crazy.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.240
What accent was that?

19:11.240 --> 19:13.240
It was all of them.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.240
I was doing all of them.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.240
How do you calculate the new breaking point?

19:17.240 --> 19:19.240
Okay, so yeah, let's do that real quick.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.240
Keith Vigna, you're at 40, correct?

19:21.240 --> 19:25.240
I'm at 40 and my last breaking point was 40, so how do I do my new breaking point?

19:25.240 --> 19:30.240
Right, so yours is easy because your power is 10, so you just subtract your power from

19:30.240 --> 19:31.240
your current sanity.

19:31.240 --> 19:34.240
So what's 40 minus 10?

19:34.240 --> 19:40.240
Clark, your sanity is currently 43 and your power is 12, so your new breaking point is

19:40.240 --> 19:41.240
31.

19:41.240 --> 19:47.240
And John Lee Pettymore, your sanity is 44 and your power is 12, which means your breaking

19:47.240 --> 19:49.240
point is 32.

19:49.240 --> 19:54.240
Hitting your breaking point will begin to change your character through the use of a

19:54.240 --> 20:00.240
new disorder that your character has gained and it will affect your willpower.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.240
I will discuss this off-microphone with you.

20:03.240 --> 20:07.240
I feel like John's definitely going to be a lot less cavalier with the lives of children

20:07.240 --> 20:09.240
after this incident.

20:09.240 --> 20:15.240
It's too late to try to vacuum them out of it.

20:15.240 --> 20:21.240
You kept describing how horrible it was and I was like, I want to vacuum, but I guess

20:21.240 --> 20:23.240
I hit my breaking point and froze.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.240
Losing that much sanity?

20:25.240 --> 20:26.240
10 or 5.

20:26.240 --> 20:29.240
I've lost 9 this session.

20:29.240 --> 20:35.240
I need you to roll against your power in order to act.

20:35.240 --> 20:38.240
And hey, this is really important.

20:38.240 --> 20:40.240
58 out of 60.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.240
You lucky son of a bitch.

20:43.240 --> 20:49.240
As this flowing dark ooze is moving toward you, you can move.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.240
I'd die for the vacuum.

20:51.240 --> 20:52.240
Oh, the bag burst.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.240
Yup.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.240
Yeah, I run.

20:58.240 --> 21:06.240
Yeah, this guy in Clark's arms is freaking the fuck out and he's like, no, I fucking

21:06.240 --> 21:08.240
told you to run.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.240
I don't know.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.240
And Clark, what are you doing?

21:11.240 --> 21:14.240
I'm like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.240
I'm getting up and running.

21:16.240 --> 21:19.240
Maybe following wherever he runs, but running away.

21:19.240 --> 21:22.240
Oh, we should run to our cruisers.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.240
No, I'm sorry.

21:23.240 --> 21:26.240
I want to follow the guy who's been sucked up in the air.

21:26.240 --> 21:27.240
See where he's running.

21:27.240 --> 21:31.240
No, I know, but maybe we should get in off foot.

21:31.240 --> 21:33.240
This thing seems quick.

21:33.240 --> 21:39.240
Okay, so he begins to run down the street away from you and also toward Marie Jacobs'

21:39.240 --> 21:40.240
house.

21:40.240 --> 21:45.240
John, do you want to head to your cruiser or are you following after this unkempt man

21:45.240 --> 21:48.240
and Clark Bishop as they haul?

21:48.240 --> 21:53.240
Are they running down like an alley or the road?

21:53.240 --> 21:54.240
What was that?

21:54.240 --> 21:57.240
I was going to say hot footed or something.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.240
I don't know what I was going to say.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.240
Hot footed is a weird thing.

22:01.240 --> 22:05.240
I was like, hot footed?

22:05.240 --> 22:07.240
What do you want to do?

22:07.240 --> 22:09.240
Are they running down a street or alley?

22:09.240 --> 22:11.240
They're running down the street in the suburbs.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.240
It's honestly a nice neighborhood.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.240
Yeah.

22:13.240 --> 22:18.240
I get in my cruiser and I take off after him with the ultimate goal of collecting them

22:18.240 --> 22:20.240
both and getting to Julie's.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.240
Jacobs?

22:21.240 --> 22:22.240
Yes.

22:22.240 --> 22:30.240
As you get in your cruiser, you'd see this writhing mass and it disappears from your

22:30.240 --> 22:31.240
vision.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.240
I mean, it was there.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.240
It didn't move anywhere.

22:35.240 --> 22:38.240
It was moving, yes, at the time, but it didn't move out of your sight.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.240
It just disappeared and you can't see it anymore.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.240
I'm not afraid of silly putty.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.240
I'm not afraid of silly putty.

22:42.240 --> 22:43.240
I'm not afraid of silly putty.

22:43.240 --> 22:49.240
You hop in your car, take off down the street, and make it to Clark Bishop and this unkempt

22:49.240 --> 22:53.240
man wearing a white tank top and rubber-like waders.

22:53.240 --> 22:58.240
You look to your right and you see the address for Dr. Marie Jacobs' house.

22:58.240 --> 23:15.780
Keith Vigna, you are at the clinic in contention where the ambulance has brought you as well

23:15.780 --> 23:16.780
as Billy-

23:16.780 --> 23:17.780
Billie.

23:17.780 --> 23:18.780
Was that his name?

23:18.780 --> 23:19.780
Billy Harrison.

23:19.780 --> 23:20.780
Billy Harrison.

23:20.780 --> 23:28.420
And you are standing in a hallway waiting and a doctor comes to you and lets you know

23:28.420 --> 23:30.820
that he has woken up.

23:30.820 --> 23:32.940
He has a concussion.

23:32.940 --> 23:40.060
He took a pretty huge blow to the back of his head and he was unconscious for quite

23:40.060 --> 23:47.540
an amount of time, which leads them to believe something might have gone wrong neurologically.

23:47.540 --> 23:51.880
So they did some scans, they're waiting on the report back, but he is currently awake

23:51.880 --> 23:56.080
and you can go talk to him and he's cuffed to the bed.

23:56.080 --> 24:02.120
As you walk into the room, he is laying in the bed, one cuff, yep, onto the bed.

24:02.120 --> 24:05.740
Is he like hostile or is he just like kind of confused?

24:05.740 --> 24:07.060
He's just sitting there.

24:07.060 --> 24:12.820
I'm gonna go into the room and, hey, Billy, uh, do you know where you are right now?

24:12.820 --> 24:14.220
He kind of looks around.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.220
H-h-hospital.

24:15.220 --> 24:20.140
Yeah, so you're in the contention hospital.

24:20.140 --> 24:21.980
My name is O-Officer Vigna.

24:21.980 --> 24:23.460
I have a couple questions for you.

24:23.460 --> 24:24.460
You're not in trouble.

24:24.460 --> 24:26.340
He kind of moves his hand.

24:26.340 --> 24:32.040
Yeah, I think, uh, so you suffered a concussion, so you might be a little confused, but I just

24:32.040 --> 24:37.500
want to set a timeline of what you remember meeting up to what I know.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.540
Does that make sense to you?

24:39.540 --> 24:40.540
Yeah.

24:40.540 --> 24:43.460
Okay, so can you tell me your name?

24:43.500 --> 24:45.580
Billy Harrison.

24:45.580 --> 24:48.920
Do you know where you are right now?

24:48.920 --> 24:51.260
You said contention.

24:51.260 --> 24:52.660
We're in contention.

24:52.660 --> 24:54.140
Are you from contention?

24:54.140 --> 24:55.140
No.

24:55.140 --> 24:56.140
Where are you from?

24:56.140 --> 25:06.120
I'm from, I'm, I'm from, I, I don't remember.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.500
Do you know how old you are?

25:07.500 --> 25:12.500
I'm 31.

25:12.820 --> 25:13.820
I'm 31.

25:13.820 --> 25:14.820
Close enough.

25:14.820 --> 25:18.340
What is the last thing you remember before you remember talking to me?

25:18.340 --> 25:22.260
I was, I went to my friend John's.

25:22.260 --> 25:23.260
John?

25:23.260 --> 25:25.260
Uh, Peters.

25:25.260 --> 25:26.260
John Peters.

25:26.260 --> 25:27.260
How do you know John Peters?

25:27.260 --> 25:29.820
We were in the army together?

25:29.820 --> 25:33.300
No, I'm, I was in the army.

25:33.300 --> 25:34.820
We're just friends.

25:34.820 --> 25:37.300
So John Peters was not in the army with you?

25:37.300 --> 25:38.900
I don't think so.

25:38.900 --> 25:41.220
No, he's an old friend.

25:41.220 --> 25:42.220
Okay.

25:42.220 --> 25:44.780
Do you remember why you went over to his house?

25:44.780 --> 25:48.940
He, he, he hadn't responded.

25:48.940 --> 25:52.020
He hadn't responded to any of my messages.

25:52.020 --> 25:53.020
And how long?

25:53.020 --> 25:55.100
A couple of days.

25:55.100 --> 25:56.500
I tried calling him.

25:56.500 --> 25:57.820
Yeah, I tried calling him.

25:57.820 --> 25:59.580
He didn't, he didn't respond.

25:59.580 --> 26:00.980
I got worried about him.

26:00.980 --> 26:03.260
How often do you usually see John?

26:03.260 --> 26:05.860
I don't see him very often.

26:05.860 --> 26:08.840
Or how do you, how often do you keep in contact with him?

26:08.840 --> 26:10.220
We talk a lot.

26:10.220 --> 26:12.020
We play video games together.

26:12.020 --> 26:13.020
Okay.

26:13.020 --> 26:15.860
He didn't respond long enough for you to be worried about him.

26:15.860 --> 26:16.860
Right?

26:16.860 --> 26:17.860
And that's why you went and checked on him?

26:17.860 --> 26:21.260
Yeah, I was on my way through town.

26:21.260 --> 26:22.740
Did you get to his house?

26:22.740 --> 26:23.740
Yeah.

26:23.740 --> 26:25.460
And did you talk to him?

26:25.460 --> 26:27.220
No, he wasn't there.

26:27.220 --> 26:31.260
I was, I was looking in, something happened at his house.

26:31.260 --> 26:34.020
Did you look into the windows or did you get into his house?

26:34.020 --> 26:36.660
I was looking in the window.

26:36.660 --> 26:40.380
That's that's the last thing you remember or can you think any harder?

26:40.380 --> 26:41.380
Is there anything?

26:41.380 --> 26:45.180
Have you seen anybody in the house or do you remember anybody coming up to you?

26:45.180 --> 26:50.140
No, I was looking through the window and now I'm here?

26:50.140 --> 26:51.580
What happened?

26:51.580 --> 26:55.100
Do you know a man by the name of Charles Donovan?

26:55.100 --> 26:56.500
No.

26:56.500 --> 27:03.380
Okay, so what's happened here is that we were chasing after a man named Charles and we found

27:03.380 --> 27:09.700
you tied up in the back of his car and he gave you, he must have hit you with something

27:09.700 --> 27:13.700
while you were looking through John's house or looking into John's house and he gave you

27:13.700 --> 27:18.700
a concussion and that's why you're here just for some tests and some just surveying to

27:18.700 --> 27:24.880
see what your health is like but do you know any one that would have wanted to hurt John?

27:24.880 --> 27:30.620
Did John ever talk about any enemies or any people he might have owed a debt to or anything

27:30.620 --> 27:34.440
that he might have been caught up with?

27:34.440 --> 27:36.540
Any kind of trouble that he was in?

27:36.540 --> 27:38.940
No, not that I can think of.

27:38.940 --> 27:40.860
What kind of video games did you play with him?

27:40.860 --> 27:43.220
Online or with him?

27:43.220 --> 27:44.220
Online.

27:44.220 --> 27:47.980
So did he ever tell you much about his personal life?

27:47.980 --> 27:54.660
I mean we just knew each other growing up and stayed in touch because we both played

27:54.660 --> 27:55.660
Call of Duty.

27:55.660 --> 27:56.660
Okay.

27:56.660 --> 27:59.340
Do you know anybody that drives a white Toyota?

27:59.340 --> 28:00.340
I mean...

28:00.340 --> 28:01.340
What kind of car do you drive?

28:01.340 --> 28:02.340
Probably.

28:02.340 --> 28:04.020
Let me start over.

28:04.020 --> 28:08.580
What kind of car do you, what car did you drive to John's house?

28:08.580 --> 28:10.340
White van.

28:10.340 --> 28:11.340
White van.

28:11.340 --> 28:12.340
Okay.

28:12.340 --> 28:15.620
And when did you go over to John's house?

28:15.620 --> 28:17.140
The third?

28:17.140 --> 28:18.140
What day is it?

28:18.140 --> 28:19.140
Today's the third.

28:19.140 --> 28:20.140
Thank god.

28:20.140 --> 28:21.220
About what time did you get there?

28:21.220 --> 28:22.540
I don't remember.

28:22.540 --> 28:25.740
I think the sun was up.

28:25.740 --> 28:26.820
How late is it?

28:26.820 --> 28:28.820
It's about eight o'clock in the evening.

28:28.820 --> 28:32.140
So had you eaten lunch before you went or?

28:32.140 --> 28:33.140
Yeah.

28:33.140 --> 28:35.940
Okay, so early afternoon probably.

28:35.940 --> 28:36.940
Yeah.

28:36.940 --> 28:37.940
So about six.

28:38.300 --> 28:39.300
Okay.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.300
About six hours you've been out.

28:40.300 --> 28:41.300
Oh god.

28:41.300 --> 28:42.300
Um.

28:42.300 --> 28:43.300
That's really bad for you, isn't it?

28:43.300 --> 28:45.540
Well, we'll let the doctors decide that.

28:45.540 --> 28:46.540
I'm not a doctor.

28:46.540 --> 28:48.820
I'm just a very good police officer.

28:48.820 --> 28:49.820
So you can trust me.

28:49.820 --> 28:51.600
You can tell me anything that you want.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.580
What kind of line of work are you in now?

28:53.580 --> 28:56.540
I'm on leave from the army.

28:56.540 --> 28:57.540
Okay.

28:57.540 --> 29:02.260
You don't happen to know anybody that works at a dog grooming facility, do you?

29:02.260 --> 29:04.260
You're asking some weird questions.

29:04.260 --> 29:08.540
I know these sound weird, but you've got a concussion, so you might not.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.020
None of these questions are weird.

29:10.020 --> 29:12.020
You just might think they are.

29:12.020 --> 29:13.020
Okay.

29:13.020 --> 29:16.540
I don't know anyone who works at a dog grooming establishment.

29:16.540 --> 29:17.540
Okay.

29:17.540 --> 29:22.340
I guess, uh, you know, I, I got, I'll give you some rest and I'll talk to the doctor

29:22.340 --> 29:23.340
to see how you're doing.

29:23.340 --> 29:28.380
I'll, I'll let you, I'll leave you to it and kind of moves his hand with the handcuff on

29:28.380 --> 29:29.380
it.

29:29.380 --> 29:32.540
Is this still necessary?

29:32.540 --> 29:41.580
Kind of feel like I was the victim and I mean, you're not treating me like I'm arrested.

29:41.580 --> 29:46.260
No, you're not under arrest, but I'm, I'm going to stick around here at the clinic until

29:46.260 --> 29:48.380
I get word from the doctor that you're okay.

29:48.380 --> 29:53.780
Um, you know, we don't want you getting up and walking off and you know, dying out there.

29:53.780 --> 29:56.620
Yeah, that makes sense.

29:56.620 --> 29:57.740
Okay.

29:57.740 --> 30:08.020
Well then can you at least take this off for now?

30:08.020 --> 30:09.620
I don't, I don't know about that.

30:09.620 --> 30:14.100
I am I under arrest?

30:14.100 --> 30:15.700
Should I put you under arrest?

30:15.700 --> 30:17.980
No, sorry, sir.

30:17.980 --> 30:22.060
You've been pretty cooperative so far, but you're making me question whether I should

30:22.060 --> 30:24.120
be done with this interview.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.580
Why were you at John Peter's house for real?

30:26.580 --> 30:28.220
I was just checking.

30:28.220 --> 30:31.540
You were checking on your friend that you play video games with?

30:31.540 --> 30:34.500
Yeah, I thought he might be in trouble.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.660
Why would you think that he was in trouble?

30:36.660 --> 30:39.980
There's times where I text my friends and they don't text me back or call me back for

30:39.980 --> 30:44.340
a couple of days and it's for no reason, especially my close friends.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.660
I don't know about if you're that close with him.

30:46.660 --> 30:51.380
Tell me why you were at John Peter's house and I pull out my other pair of handcuffs

30:51.380 --> 30:57.180
and handcuff his other hand to the other side of the bed.

30:57.180 --> 30:58.180
Out of game.

30:58.180 --> 31:01.300
Is this something I should pursue or am I wasting time?

31:01.300 --> 31:03.500
You can do anything you want.

31:03.500 --> 31:04.860
Here's what we're going to do.

31:04.860 --> 31:16.180
As you walk up to his bed with the other pair of handcuffs, I need you to roll unarmed combat.

31:16.180 --> 31:20.700
I got a 54 on a 40 and he got a success.

31:20.700 --> 31:30.020
So as you approach him in one swift motion, he pulls your gun from your holster and immediately

31:30.020 --> 31:36.580
has it drawn on you and he says, uncuff my hand right now or I'm going to shoot you.

31:36.580 --> 31:40.860
Can I roll humant to see if he is just scared or...

31:40.860 --> 31:41.860
Absolutely.

31:41.860 --> 31:42.860
40 on 80.

31:42.860 --> 31:50.160
Yeah, not only is he not scared in this moment at all, it looks like he has done this before

31:50.160 --> 31:53.480
and he is going to shoot you.

31:53.480 --> 31:57.440
What would I roll?

31:57.440 --> 32:02.720
I'm thinking of like, I want to like jump and just tase him, but I like, do I have the,

32:02.720 --> 32:06.760
I'm thinking I have a taser gun, but do I have like a stick it in his neck kind of taser?

32:06.760 --> 32:07.760
Oh, I don't know.

32:07.760 --> 32:08.760
You probably have the gun.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.680
I think that's what they carry these days.

32:10.680 --> 32:13.720
Hey Luke, he's going to shoot you.

32:13.720 --> 32:14.720
Okay.

32:14.720 --> 32:20.800
Okay, I put my hand up.

32:20.800 --> 32:21.800
Okay.

32:21.800 --> 32:26.520
I'm reaching down to my pot, to my, what do you call the little thing they wear?

32:26.520 --> 32:27.520
Tactical belt.

32:27.520 --> 32:28.520
Yeah.

32:28.520 --> 32:29.520
Okay.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.800
I'm reaching down to my belt to pull out the key.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.080
Please don't shoot me.

32:33.080 --> 32:38.200
He kind of moves the handcuff in a position to make it easy for you to unlock it.

32:38.200 --> 32:41.600
I put the key in the lock, I twist it.

32:41.600 --> 32:42.600
It unclicks.

32:42.600 --> 32:45.880
I put the key back on my belt and the handcuffs are unlocked.

32:45.880 --> 32:49.680
He says, turn around.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.260
I turn around.

32:51.260 --> 32:53.320
He stands up and he's behind you.

32:53.320 --> 33:00.000
He's got the gun pressed firmly against the back of your head and he says, all right,

33:00.000 --> 33:01.400
here's what we're going to do.

33:01.400 --> 33:02.400
Fuck.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.400
Okay.

33:03.400 --> 33:07.960
I guess roll alertness for me.

33:07.960 --> 33:08.960
Pass.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.840
53 on a 60.

33:10.840 --> 33:11.840
Okay.

33:12.080 --> 33:15.360
72 and your lights go out.

33:26.880 --> 33:27.880
All right.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.680
Thomas and Joe.

33:30.680 --> 33:36.600
John Lee Pettymore drives his cruiser down the road of the suburbs and makes it to where

33:36.600 --> 33:43.000
Clark Bishop and this haggard looking man are running down the street and you guys kind

33:43.000 --> 33:48.280
of slow down as you're looking behind you and the guy says, it's gone.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.400
Oh, it's gone.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.400
Yeah.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.360
I can't, I can't see it either, man.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.040
What the fuck was it?

33:55.040 --> 33:58.120
Oh shit.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.120
It's here.

33:59.120 --> 34:04.900
And he turns and he kind of bends down and looks inside the cruiser and he sees John

34:04.900 --> 34:13.820
Lee Pettymore and he backs up immediately and he's like, I can, what are you, what are

34:13.820 --> 34:14.820
you?

34:14.820 --> 34:15.820
And he looks at both of you.

34:15.820 --> 34:16.820
He's like, what are you doing?

34:16.820 --> 34:20.940
And he just fucking starts running back toward his house immediately.

34:20.940 --> 34:21.940
Whoa, whoa.

34:21.940 --> 34:22.940
Hey, but whoa.

34:22.940 --> 34:23.940
And I'm trying to chase after him.

34:23.940 --> 34:25.440
If I can get a hand on him.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.440
You can get a hand.

34:26.440 --> 34:29.500
I mean, do you want to like, he's, he's really trying to get away.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.380
So I would just like to grab him so we can't get away.

34:31.380 --> 34:32.380
Whatever that would take.

34:32.380 --> 34:33.380
Yeah.

34:33.380 --> 34:35.100
I mean, you could do unarmed combat or strength.

34:35.100 --> 34:37.940
I'll do an armed combat.

34:37.940 --> 34:38.940
Okay.

34:38.940 --> 34:41.860
I fail fucking 91 on a 70.

34:41.860 --> 34:42.860
Okay.

34:42.860 --> 34:43.860
He passes.

34:43.860 --> 34:47.780
So he gets away from you and he starts running down the street and he looks crazy.

34:47.780 --> 34:54.540
I mean, this guy's wearing a white tank top with big rubber waders on and he's just like

34:54.540 --> 34:56.100
hoofing it down the street.

34:56.100 --> 34:57.100
I don't know.

34:57.100 --> 34:58.100
Squeak, squeak, squeak.

34:58.100 --> 35:02.060
Uh, yeah, I don't think I'm going to pursue.

35:02.060 --> 35:04.020
I think I'll watch him run away.

35:04.020 --> 35:05.020
Same.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.020
Okay.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.020
So he runs back to his house.

35:07.020 --> 35:08.020
I know where he lives.

35:08.020 --> 35:13.300
We, I, we know where you live.

35:13.300 --> 35:18.780
He looks back over his shoulder, crazed the look in his eyes like dips into his house.

35:18.780 --> 35:19.780
Cool.

35:19.780 --> 35:20.780
All right.

35:20.780 --> 35:23.460
So you guys are like right in front of the Jacobs home.

35:23.460 --> 35:29.220
It's a beautiful modern home with a large front yard and a recessed interest entrance.

35:29.220 --> 35:35.420
Just like every home on this street and in this neighborhood, you are in the suburbs.

35:35.420 --> 35:39.940
Honestly this, this part of town seems a little nice for waiters, like the waiter guy, not

35:39.940 --> 35:40.940
waiters.

35:40.940 --> 35:45.820
This part of town does seem a little nice for waiters.

35:45.820 --> 35:49.380
I mean, we've all, no servers live in this neighborhood.

35:49.380 --> 35:53.180
We've all waited tables, but I'm realizing suddenly that it's a little weird roleplay

35:53.180 --> 35:57.100
wise that we shrug our shoulders and go investigate Dr. Murray's house.

35:57.100 --> 35:59.060
I don't know what you're talking about.

35:59.060 --> 36:03.660
This seems convenient and perfect to me.

36:03.660 --> 36:05.720
I don't feel great about those kids.

36:05.720 --> 36:08.540
You know, they fucking, they're fucking gone.

36:08.540 --> 36:15.200
All right, listen, Clark, we never saw two kids, but they were, they were just, you understand

36:15.200 --> 36:19.660
that we cannot have like, we can't be on the hook for the death of two children.

36:19.660 --> 36:24.100
Nobody's going to believe the crazy guy and the waiters.

36:24.100 --> 36:25.740
There were never any kids.

36:25.740 --> 36:26.740
Yeah.

36:27.380 --> 36:28.380
Yeah, there weren't.

36:28.380 --> 36:35.940
We don't know what happened to those two, those two, those two children.

36:35.940 --> 36:38.340
There weren't, there weren't, there weren't, there weren't no children.

36:38.340 --> 36:39.340
There were no children.

36:39.340 --> 36:42.940
Let's uh, let's see what this doctor knows about our cases.

36:42.940 --> 36:44.500
You guys mark up to the front door?

36:44.500 --> 36:45.500
Yeah, I'll knock.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.940
This is good knocking.

36:47.940 --> 36:53.100
This is much better than Luke's.

36:53.100 --> 36:58.660
You hear scuffling from inside and then you can like very clearly hear someone approaching

36:58.660 --> 37:03.460
the door and you hear some heavy breathing, like right on the other side of the door.

37:03.460 --> 37:12.800
It's just like Dr. Jacobs, we have a few questions for you now.

37:12.800 --> 37:14.340
We'd just like to talk ma'am.

37:14.340 --> 37:17.500
If you could just even open your door, we could just have a word with you right here.

37:17.500 --> 37:21.300
We can talk through the door.

37:21.300 --> 37:24.580
Go away ma'am.

37:24.580 --> 37:25.580
We're the police.

37:25.580 --> 37:26.980
We, we need to, we need to talk to you.

37:26.980 --> 37:27.980
I know who you are.

37:27.980 --> 37:29.980
You have a warrant?

37:29.980 --> 37:30.980
Maybe.

37:30.980 --> 37:33.740
Uh, we don't, we don't need a warrant to find out.

37:33.740 --> 37:35.780
You can come back with a warrant.

37:35.780 --> 37:37.140
No, that's not her voice.

37:37.140 --> 37:38.140
I don't know.

37:38.140 --> 37:39.140
Yeah.

37:39.140 --> 37:40.140
Do you want to?

37:40.140 --> 37:41.140
Yeah, I do.

37:41.140 --> 37:42.140
Restart?

37:42.140 --> 37:43.140
I do.

37:43.140 --> 37:44.140
Okay.

37:44.140 --> 37:45.140
She has a nicer house than that.

37:45.140 --> 37:46.140
Yeah.

37:46.140 --> 37:47.140
Fuck.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.140
Contention PD.

37:48.140 --> 37:49.140
Go away.

37:49.980 --> 37:51.980
See, I thought you were going to go less witchy.

37:51.980 --> 37:52.980
Yeah.

37:52.980 --> 37:53.980
Nope.

37:53.980 --> 38:02.040
John, it's a witch.

38:02.040 --> 38:03.040
It's a witch.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.040
What'd you say?

38:04.040 --> 38:05.040
You said contingent PD?

38:05.040 --> 38:06.040
Yeah.

38:06.040 --> 38:11.040
Uh, we just, we just need to, I wasn't doing that, I didn't care.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.040
Do you want me to say that?

38:12.040 --> 38:13.040
Clark's mind is preoccupied.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.040
What?

38:14.040 --> 38:15.040
Did you just say contingent PD?

38:15.040 --> 38:18.900
Uh, would you, uh, we just need to ask you some questions ma'am.

38:19.660 --> 38:20.660
Okay.

38:20.660 --> 38:21.660
Can you open the door for me?

38:21.660 --> 38:24.300
You can ask your questions through the door.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.140
Pausing the role play.

38:26.140 --> 38:27.820
What do we want to ask her actually?

38:27.820 --> 38:28.820
Yeah.

38:28.820 --> 38:32.940
So her, she was just circled in the phone book at Julie Maxwell's place.

38:32.940 --> 38:35.060
That's the only real lead we have to come here.

38:35.060 --> 38:36.060
So maybe if she knows her.

38:36.060 --> 38:37.260
I thought we had a couple other things though.

38:37.260 --> 38:41.180
I thought other people had, I thought there were two or three vectors to her.

38:41.180 --> 38:42.180
Nope.

38:42.180 --> 38:43.180
I do have something else to her.

38:43.180 --> 38:44.180
Oh, do you?

38:44.180 --> 38:45.180
Yes.

38:45.180 --> 38:46.180
Uh, she bought the radio from the treasure shop.

38:46.180 --> 38:47.180
Yes.

38:47.180 --> 38:48.180
That's important.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.460
Good.

38:49.460 --> 38:50.460
Good fucking call.

38:50.460 --> 38:51.880
John and Thomas.

38:51.880 --> 38:59.420
So then what do we want to ask her like, radio repair.

38:59.420 --> 39:00.420
What were you saying?

39:00.420 --> 39:03.780
I put it together in my head that Julie might've just circled her name in the phone book as

39:03.780 --> 39:06.820
another person who bought a crazy item like her camera.

39:06.820 --> 39:10.220
So she might not know who Julie Maxwell is either way.

39:10.220 --> 39:15.340
Ma'am, we just wanted to, uh, did you purchase anything from the, uh, oh shit.

39:15.340 --> 39:16.340
What's it called?

39:16.340 --> 39:17.340
Sorry.

39:17.500 --> 39:21.100
Did you purchase anything from forgotten treasures in the last, uh, let's say month.

39:21.100 --> 39:24.420
I buy many things from forgotten treasures.

39:24.420 --> 39:27.180
Did you happen to buy an old radio?

39:27.180 --> 39:30.460
No.

39:30.460 --> 39:31.460
We think you did.

39:31.460 --> 39:32.700
And we're just kind of interested in it.

39:32.700 --> 39:33.700
Go away.

39:33.700 --> 39:34.700
You didn't do anything wrong.

39:34.700 --> 39:38.020
We just, uh, we're just curious about that old radio you bought.

39:38.020 --> 39:39.500
You want to open the door for us?

39:39.500 --> 39:40.500
Why?

39:40.500 --> 39:41.640
So we can take a look at that old thing.

39:41.640 --> 39:42.640
It sounds cool.

39:42.640 --> 39:43.640
It's not here.

39:43.640 --> 39:46.060
Uh, where, where'd it go?

39:46.060 --> 39:47.060
It's gone.

39:47.780 --> 39:48.780
Did you sell it?

39:48.780 --> 39:49.780
No.

39:49.780 --> 39:50.780
What'd you fetch?

39:50.780 --> 39:51.780
What kind of price you fetch for that?

39:51.780 --> 39:52.780
Can I hement her to see if she's lying?

39:52.780 --> 39:53.780
Yeah.

39:53.780 --> 39:54.780
I do not pass.

39:54.780 --> 39:55.780
83 out of 50.

39:55.780 --> 39:56.780
You don't know.

39:56.780 --> 40:00.820
Uh, so if you didn't sell it, why, why is it not here?

40:00.820 --> 40:02.380
A man came and took it.

40:02.380 --> 40:03.980
A man came and took your radio?

40:03.980 --> 40:04.980
A man came and took it.

40:04.980 --> 40:06.020
I'm sorry to hear that.

40:06.020 --> 40:07.500
Did you get a good look at the guy?

40:07.500 --> 40:09.460
We can, we can go and get that for you.

40:09.460 --> 40:10.620
He said no cops.

40:10.620 --> 40:12.020
Oh, we can be discreet.

40:12.020 --> 40:13.100
Oh, can you?

40:13.100 --> 40:16.060
Knocking on the door, yelling about radios.

40:16.060 --> 40:17.800
Who's got us there?

40:17.800 --> 40:20.060
We can be discreet from here on out for you.

40:20.060 --> 40:23.260
It's a lot easier to be discreet when you let us inside, ma'am.

40:23.260 --> 40:25.180
There's nothing here for you.

40:25.180 --> 40:26.300
Go away.

40:26.300 --> 40:28.020
Was that man John Peters?

40:28.020 --> 40:30.160
I don't know who that is.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.700
Can you describe the man who took that?

40:31.700 --> 40:32.700
He was tall.

40:32.700 --> 40:33.700
He was drunk.

40:33.700 --> 40:35.740
He was very mean.

40:35.740 --> 40:37.580
Did he break into your house to get that radio?

40:37.580 --> 40:38.580
Yes.

40:38.580 --> 40:39.940
Did you watch him carry it away?

40:39.940 --> 40:40.940
He had a gun.

40:40.940 --> 40:42.220
Did you see him drive off?

40:42.220 --> 40:43.220
No.

40:43.220 --> 40:44.220
Is he still here?

40:44.220 --> 40:45.220
No.

40:45.380 --> 40:49.300
He's gone, as is the radio that you so desperately desire.

40:49.300 --> 40:50.300
I turned to John.

40:50.300 --> 40:53.260
John, I mean a tall, drunk guy stealing a radio.

40:53.260 --> 40:55.660
It's gotta be Charles, right?

40:55.660 --> 41:00.980
There was the description of the menacing, drunk, mean guy with the gin blossoms.

41:00.980 --> 41:01.980
That wasn't Charles, right?

41:01.980 --> 41:02.980
I think it was.

41:02.980 --> 41:03.980
Oh, okay.

41:03.980 --> 41:04.980
Yeah, I think you're right.

41:04.980 --> 41:07.380
Because he was at Treasure, fucking, what's it called?

41:07.380 --> 41:08.380
Forgotten Treasures.

41:08.380 --> 41:10.860
I'm forgetting the word forgotten.

41:10.860 --> 41:11.860
He was at Forgotten Treasures.

41:11.860 --> 41:13.620
He was drunk when I saw him.

41:13.620 --> 41:16.020
It's gotta be Charles, and he's dead.

41:16.020 --> 41:18.540
Well, we need to follow up on his hotel room, then.

41:18.540 --> 41:20.380
He's staying at the same hotel as Vigna.

41:20.380 --> 41:21.380
Go away.

41:21.380 --> 41:25.660
Just to satisfy our curiosity while we're here, what kind of doctor are you?

41:25.660 --> 41:28.340
I am a doctor.

41:28.340 --> 41:31.340
I am a family doctor.

41:31.340 --> 41:32.340
That's a noble profession.

41:32.340 --> 41:33.340
Thank you, ma'am.

41:33.340 --> 41:34.340
Thank you.

41:34.340 --> 41:35.340
Okay.

41:35.340 --> 41:36.340
Hey, Salem.

41:36.340 --> 41:37.340
Oh, God.

41:37.340 --> 41:39.300
I think she might be a witch.

41:39.300 --> 41:43.100
As she says that, you kind of see, so she's got one of those doors that has the glass

41:43.100 --> 41:48.260
pane at the top, and so you can see movement through there, and you didn't see any shape

41:48.260 --> 41:53.500
or anything earlier when she came to the door, but there is kind of the shape of a taller

41:53.500 --> 41:56.420
person there, and she's like, I have to go.

41:56.420 --> 41:59.860
If you would like to continue talking, I will be back post-haste.

41:59.860 --> 42:02.060
Ma'am, is there somebody in there with you?

42:02.060 --> 42:04.060
Clark, I don't think we need a warrant anymore.

42:04.060 --> 42:05.780
I think we have reasonable ...

42:05.780 --> 42:13.540
You know the words.

42:13.540 --> 42:15.540
Okay.

42:15.540 --> 42:20.300
We can't start doing takes and shit, though.

42:20.300 --> 42:23.900
Clark, I think we have reasonable ...

42:23.900 --> 42:30.540
John, are you trying to say reasonable suspicion?

42:30.540 --> 42:31.540
I sure am, Clark.

42:31.540 --> 42:32.540
I think we might as well.

42:32.540 --> 42:33.540
All right.

42:33.540 --> 42:34.540
I kick down the door.

42:35.540 --> 42:36.540
Okay.

42:36.540 --> 42:39.540
Go ahead and roll law.

42:39.540 --> 42:41.540
How about that?

42:41.540 --> 42:42.540
35 on a 50.

42:42.540 --> 42:44.540
Yeah, you've done this before.

42:44.540 --> 42:45.540
You know how to do it.

42:45.540 --> 42:46.540
Okay.

42:46.540 --> 42:48.540
I mean, they train you how to kick in a door.

42:48.540 --> 42:49.540
For sure.

42:49.540 --> 42:51.540
I figured it would be a strength test.

42:51.540 --> 42:53.540
Not like a cop test, but I like it.

42:53.540 --> 42:55.540
I'm trying to change things up.

42:55.540 --> 42:58.540
The cop test was so that you knew you were in the right to do this.

42:58.540 --> 42:59.540
Exactly.

42:59.540 --> 43:03.540
You had the force of the law behind your kick.

43:03.540 --> 43:06.540
So, I've kicked down the door at gun drawn.

43:06.540 --> 43:11.540
We're here to protect you, doctor.

43:11.540 --> 43:14.540
You kick in the door and you immediately see the house.

43:14.540 --> 43:16.540
The house is a complete wreck.

43:16.540 --> 43:17.540
It smells weird in here.

43:17.540 --> 43:21.540
There's a haze in the air, but she's not there.

43:21.540 --> 43:25.540
But you can kind of hear yelling like ...

43:25.540 --> 43:26.540
Like from the basement.

43:26.540 --> 43:30.540
There's a door very clearly kind of around the corner that leads to the basement and

43:30.540 --> 43:32.540
it's open.

43:32.540 --> 43:35.540
Do you guys want to start going there or do you want to look around the rest of the house?

43:35.540 --> 43:40.540
I want to do just a visual scan as I'm walking toward the basement door.

43:40.540 --> 43:41.540
What can I see from ...

43:41.540 --> 43:42.540
An ocular pad.

43:42.540 --> 43:43.540
An ocular pad and of the premises.

43:43.540 --> 43:45.540
So, there's not a lot specific up here.

43:45.540 --> 43:48.540
All over the house, there's a bunch of random stuff.

43:48.540 --> 43:54.540
It's on the counters, the tables, any surface is full of stuff and not clean.

43:54.540 --> 44:01.540
There are beakers and other types of like containment objects all over the place as

44:01.540 --> 44:06.540
well as mini jars, which is another thing that I just said.

44:06.540 --> 44:08.540
Something you can contain things in.

44:08.540 --> 44:11.540
Also, some bowls.

44:11.540 --> 44:12.540
No, I'm just ...

44:12.540 --> 44:15.540
So, lots of stuff like that around.

44:15.540 --> 44:18.540
Just kind of like all around a mess.

44:18.540 --> 44:27.540
There's shit everywhere and in fact, it smells terrible and it kind of smells like shit in here.

44:27.540 --> 44:28.540
People or animals.

44:28.540 --> 44:29.540
Which is weird.

44:29.540 --> 44:30.540
Well, when you ...

44:30.540 --> 44:31.540
Just general.

44:31.540 --> 44:32.540
Both, yeah.

44:32.540 --> 44:43.540
However, good question because when you go around, you do see a litter box, but there's

44:43.540 --> 44:47.540
poop in it, but it doesn't look like cat poop.

44:47.540 --> 44:48.540
Is it too big?

44:48.540 --> 44:49.540
It's too big.

44:49.540 --> 44:50.540
She is a fucking witch.

44:50.540 --> 44:53.540
She's got a giant cat man named Salem.

44:53.540 --> 44:55.540
Can we discern anything that she's yelling?

44:55.540 --> 44:58.540
As she starts walking up the stairs.

44:58.540 --> 45:01.540
She's like, did you kick down my door?

45:01.540 --> 45:03.540
We thought you were in trouble, ma'am.

45:03.540 --> 45:05.540
I am in no trouble.

45:05.540 --> 45:08.540
Please leave my home immediately.

45:08.540 --> 45:13.540
Ma'am, we believe you are Harvey and a legal giant cat man in this premises.

45:13.540 --> 45:16.540
Do you hear the words coming out of your mouth, officer?

45:16.540 --> 45:17.540
I just point to the litter box.

45:17.540 --> 45:22.540
She looks over at it and she says, Salem is going to get some licks for that.

45:22.540 --> 45:23.540
Can you show us Salem, ma'am?

45:23.540 --> 45:24.540
Yeah.

45:24.540 --> 45:29.540
And she points at a picture on one of the countertops somewhere.

45:29.540 --> 45:31.540
It's a picture of her and her husband and their cat.

45:31.540 --> 45:32.540
They have a black cat.

45:32.540 --> 45:34.540
Ma'am, there was somebody else in this house.

45:34.540 --> 45:36.540
Do you know where they went?

45:36.540 --> 45:37.540
That was just Doug.

45:37.540 --> 45:38.540
Who's Doug?

45:38.540 --> 45:39.540
Doug's my husband.

45:39.540 --> 45:40.540
She points at the same picture.

45:40.540 --> 45:41.540
Where'd Doug go?

45:41.540 --> 45:43.540
He's downstairs.

45:43.540 --> 45:45.540
He does not want to be disturbed.

45:45.540 --> 45:49.540
Well, tough titty said the kitty.

45:49.540 --> 45:52.540
I brush past her and start walking down the stairs.

45:52.540 --> 45:53.540
No.

45:53.540 --> 45:54.540
I holler down the stairs.

45:54.540 --> 45:57.540
Doug, I need you to come up here.

45:57.540 --> 45:59.540
You hear?

45:59.540 --> 46:01.540
Meow.

46:01.540 --> 46:02.540
From downstairs?

46:02.540 --> 46:03.540
Yeah.

46:03.540 --> 46:12.540
It's a fucking cat man.

46:12.540 --> 46:13.540
Oh my God.

46:13.540 --> 46:14.540
All right.

46:14.540 --> 46:17.540
Cover me.

46:17.540 --> 46:22.540
A cold chill runs down Clark's spine as the joke that they were having suddenly becomes

46:22.540 --> 46:24.540
very real.

46:24.540 --> 46:26.540
This was never a joke to me, Clark.

46:26.540 --> 46:27.540
It was to me.

46:27.540 --> 46:28.540
Don't go down there.

46:28.540 --> 46:32.540
And she kind of like tries to get in front of you and close the door to the steps to

46:32.540 --> 46:33.540
the basement.

46:33.540 --> 46:34.540
I hold the door.

46:34.540 --> 46:35.540
She's just looking up at you.

46:35.540 --> 46:40.540
By the way, Dr. Marie Jacobs is an older, short, plump woman.

46:40.540 --> 46:43.540
She has mascara smeared all over her entire face.

46:43.540 --> 46:45.540
Her hair is a complete disaster.

46:45.540 --> 46:49.540
And she is wearing a white coverall with long neoprene gloves.

46:49.540 --> 46:54.540
Does it look like if you smeared the mascara off her face, she might actually be a cat?

46:54.540 --> 46:59.540
From what you know about both humans and cats, I would say no.

46:59.540 --> 47:01.540
Okay.

47:01.540 --> 47:05.540
As she does this, she looks at John and she says,

47:05.540 --> 47:08.540
Actually.

47:08.540 --> 47:10.540
And turns to Clark and says,

47:10.540 --> 47:12.540
You can go downstairs.

47:12.540 --> 47:13.540
And looks back at John.

47:13.540 --> 47:15.540
Join me in the kitchen for a moment.

47:15.540 --> 47:17.540
Sidebar, Clark?

47:17.540 --> 47:18.540
One moment, ma'am.

47:18.540 --> 47:19.540
Doctor.

47:19.540 --> 47:20.540
Thank you.

47:20.540 --> 47:24.540
I didn't go to seven years of school to be called ma'am.

47:24.540 --> 47:25.540
Of course not, doctor.

47:25.540 --> 47:26.540
Hey, Clark.

47:26.540 --> 47:28.540
You're not going to let me go down there alone, right?

47:28.540 --> 47:29.540
No, no.

47:29.540 --> 47:30.540
We got to arrest her right now, right?

47:30.540 --> 47:32.540
Like this is suspicious as hell.

47:32.540 --> 47:33.540
Yeah.

47:33.540 --> 47:35.540
She's like dissecting a cat man down there or something, right?

47:35.540 --> 47:36.540
Yeah.

47:36.540 --> 47:38.540
Something unholy is happening in this house.

47:38.540 --> 47:39.540
Things are real weird.

47:39.540 --> 47:40.540
That's against the law, right?

47:40.540 --> 47:42.540
At the very least, the guy downstairs ain't coming up.

47:42.540 --> 47:44.540
And after I told him to come up.

47:44.540 --> 47:45.540
So.

47:45.540 --> 47:46.540
Handcuff her?

47:46.540 --> 47:47.540
Yeah.

47:47.540 --> 47:48.540
I just started handcuffing her.

47:48.540 --> 47:49.540
And I started reading.

47:49.540 --> 47:55.180
Ma'am, you're under arrest for suspicion of harboring an unholy cat man for impeding the

47:55.180 --> 47:58.860
investigation of two officers for just being creepy as hell.

47:58.860 --> 48:01.540
Clark, you got anything to add?

48:01.540 --> 48:02.540
No.

48:02.540 --> 48:03.540
That was it.

48:03.540 --> 48:04.540
All right.

48:04.540 --> 48:05.540
Yeah.

48:05.540 --> 48:06.540
I'm real sorry, doctor.

48:06.540 --> 48:08.540
But you are just under all kinds of arrest.

48:08.540 --> 48:09.540
Salem!

48:10.540 --> 48:17.540
And you hear just this like boom, boom, boom, like coming up the stairs.

48:17.540 --> 48:18.540
I cuff her as quickly.

48:18.540 --> 48:20.540
I try to cuff her like very quickly.

48:20.540 --> 48:21.540
All right.

48:21.540 --> 48:22.540
Roll.

48:22.540 --> 48:24.540
You can either roll law or dexterity.

48:24.540 --> 48:25.540
Dexterity.

48:25.540 --> 48:26.540
Okay.

48:26.540 --> 48:28.540
58 on a 65.

48:28.540 --> 48:29.540
Well done.

48:29.540 --> 48:37.540
You get the cuffs locked and you are ready for whatever is about to happen next.

48:39.540 --> 48:40.540
Thank you.

48:40.540 --> 48:40.540
