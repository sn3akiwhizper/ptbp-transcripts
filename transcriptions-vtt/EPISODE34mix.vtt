00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
Hello, and welcome y'all.

00:03.120 --> 00:06.360
It is December the 6th, and my clock here says

00:06.360 --> 00:10.120
it is 1030 a.m. here in the city.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.400
What time is it in your world?

00:12.400 --> 00:14.440
What is time anyway?

00:14.440 --> 00:16.560
Is it a circle or some shit?

00:16.560 --> 00:18.820
Shit, I don't know, that's for sure.

00:18.820 --> 00:23.820
Well, anyway, I'm coming at you live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:24.560 --> 00:27.920
this dimension's best radio show

00:27.960 --> 00:32.660
that is fueled by dumpster meat of varying quality.

00:32.660 --> 00:36.200
I've got a howlin' with wolf here from an anonymous source.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.280
Remember, if you wanna write up somethin'

00:38.280 --> 00:41.120
for your wolf to howl, tag at PretendingPod

00:41.120 --> 00:44.160
on Instagram or Twitter, tag PretendingToBePeople

00:44.160 --> 00:46.600
on Facebook, or write a five-star review

00:46.600 --> 00:50.320
and email us at pretendingpod at gmail.com.

00:50.320 --> 00:55.280
This one is a bit unsettling, so no point in settlin' in.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.840
We alone are the last of the line,

00:58.720 --> 01:00.120
ascendant when the giants walked

01:00.120 --> 01:03.600
and still clutching to power when the last ragged outpost

01:03.600 --> 01:06.240
of our kind fell to internal ruin.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.160
Our line will rule again.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.280
There are secrets buried still,

01:10.280 --> 01:12.680
lost in the deserts forgotten and places

01:12.680 --> 01:14.720
where man cannot go.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.700
Our illusion is perfect.

01:16.700 --> 01:19.360
We walk unseen through the streets

01:19.360 --> 01:22.280
in the child scrawl of the world before us,

01:22.280 --> 01:27.200
and we resist the call to feed, the smells, the meat.

01:27.240 --> 01:30.880
We resist, for there is clarity and starvation.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.480
Just as in our disguises,

01:32.480 --> 01:34.780
there is freedom among the savages,

01:34.780 --> 01:38.920
and then in the desert where we buried our last machines,

01:38.920 --> 01:40.760
there is salvation.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.060
Well, fuck.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.080
Once they started talkin' about meat,

01:44.080 --> 01:46.920
I just kinda lost track there, y'all.

01:46.920 --> 01:51.440
Anyway, things aren't any cleaner or clearer here in the city

01:51.440 --> 01:55.800
It's uncertain, it's impure, it's the news.

01:55.800 --> 01:59.640
Stan Manstein left the city asylum, a rare occurrence,

01:59.640 --> 02:01.240
in order to speak at the funeral

02:01.240 --> 02:03.680
of his daughter, Ari Manstein.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.740
He was accompanied by three guards,

02:05.740 --> 02:08.040
all made out of flesh and wire.

02:08.040 --> 02:10.040
He spoke in a strange tongue,

02:10.040 --> 02:13.440
and the world slowed down around our three officers

02:13.440 --> 02:16.000
who heard Stan speak inside the heads,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.400
tellin' the story of a particular past

02:18.400 --> 02:20.480
of the town of contention.

02:20.480 --> 02:23.880
Clark Bishop shot Stan Manstein mid-story,

02:23.880 --> 02:25.600
bringin' the world up to speed

02:25.600 --> 02:28.640
and causin' full-blown chaos at this funeral.

02:28.640 --> 02:30.560
People began to run for their lives

02:30.560 --> 02:34.880
as our obliviously intrepid heroes fought, shot,

02:34.880 --> 02:38.520
and demolished the large guards made of blood and metal.

02:38.520 --> 02:42.540
Keith Vigna plugged Stan Manstein's wounds with his fingers,

02:42.540 --> 02:45.560
givin' him just enough strength to complete his story

02:45.560 --> 02:48.040
and blip out of existence.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.980
John Lee Pettymore IV,

02:49.980 --> 02:52.680
inside the body of his adopted father,

02:52.720 --> 02:54.600
John Lee Pettymore III,

02:54.600 --> 02:56.680
who the officers met as Kevin,

02:56.680 --> 02:58.740
Marvin Glass's head of security,

02:58.740 --> 03:01.380
tried to explain that whole convoluted mess

03:01.380 --> 03:03.920
to his former coworkers.

03:03.920 --> 03:06.720
The officers took stock of their situation,

03:06.720 --> 03:09.520
tryin' to remember where the weird items they'd found

03:09.520 --> 03:11.220
are currently located.

03:11.220 --> 03:15.720
Last we saw, John Lee Pettymore put his hands up to his head

03:15.720 --> 03:18.240
and his eyes turned white.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.560
Man, I tell you what,

03:19.560 --> 03:22.840
I left contention because of all this weird nonsense,

03:22.840 --> 03:25.140
but it seems to have followed me to the city.

03:25.140 --> 03:26.800
Wolf.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.400
Oh, no, Wolf.

03:29.400 --> 03:33.240
What if you're the source of all this pain and sufferin'?

03:33.240 --> 03:35.320
What if I am the sinner

03:35.320 --> 03:38.520
from which all struggles emanate from

03:38.520 --> 03:41.180
the pulsating heart of darkness?

03:41.180 --> 03:44.080
Does it all come from little old Wolfie?

03:46.440 --> 03:48.720
Uh, probably not.

03:48.720 --> 03:51.040
I have a message here from my producer.

03:51.040 --> 03:55.040
They say we are sitting at 84 reviews on iTunes.

03:55.040 --> 03:58.800
That's about 16 reviews short of bein' real nice,

03:58.800 --> 04:03.800
and 336 short of bein' real nice.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.600
So we got a super special announcement in mind

04:06.600 --> 04:08.920
for when we hit that 100 review mark.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.480
You'll be happy, Wolf'll be happy,

04:11.480 --> 04:13.000
and when Wolf is happy,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.840
he claps his hands on the three and the four.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.060
It's kazoo with no backbone.

04:19.060 --> 04:20.680
No.

04:49.060 --> 05:00.940
John, as your eyes roll backward, your vision goes dark.

05:00.940 --> 05:07.280
Images begin flashing through your mind, just snippets, moments, and you try to keep up.

05:07.280 --> 05:15.780
As the speed of this sequence waxes and wanes, you see a motel safe, shiny, black, and closed.

05:15.780 --> 05:22.540
You see the sign for Bean's Pond, the little pond behind Chief Maggie Cook's house in contention.

05:22.540 --> 05:24.140
You see a television.

05:24.140 --> 05:32.300
It is blinking with different letters on it, R, S, T, L, N, E. You see a small clearing

05:32.300 --> 05:36.540
in the woods, and the ground is scorched.

05:36.540 --> 05:43.180
In a dark room, lit by various electronics and machines, you see a massive, shiny metal

05:43.180 --> 05:49.740
sphere, 20 feet tall, with silvery arms extending from either side.

05:49.740 --> 05:54.500
A tube connects this gargantuan ball to a machine below.

05:54.500 --> 06:00.740
The machine begins whirring, and you see a small metal sphere, roughly one inch in diameter,

06:00.740 --> 06:06.700
begin moving up through the tubing into the larger, armed version of itself.

06:06.700 --> 06:11.700
As this happens, a vast circle opens up in the ceiling, and a disorienting amount of

06:11.700 --> 06:17.420
light and sound pours into the room, revealing text painted on the back wall that says the

06:17.420 --> 06:29.260
same thing you hear violently chanted by an unseen crowd, Planet Juggernaut.

06:29.260 --> 06:34.780
The scene changes again, and you see Marvin Glass standing at his desk in the grand room

06:34.780 --> 06:39.440
you recently stood in as Kevin, alongside Rosemary.

06:39.440 --> 06:45.080
Marvin is holding the odd camera with glass tubes, closely inspecting it, tapping its

06:45.080 --> 06:47.180
lit red luminaire.

06:47.180 --> 06:55.000
On his desk are two file folders, splayed open, entitled, The Real Files on Clark Bishop

06:55.000 --> 07:04.040
& Keith Vigna, Contention Police Officers, subtitled, Oh That Cunning Marvin Glass, subtitled,

07:04.040 --> 07:11.720
Zach Was Being Lazy.

07:11.720 --> 07:19.480
You can see in Keith's file are various clippings about the Beenz family, the tragic

07:19.480 --> 07:25.440
accidental deaths of William and Lena, Keith's parents, the takeover of the family business

07:25.440 --> 07:27.160
by Ferguson.

07:27.160 --> 07:32.720
In Clark's file, there is a newspaper article about the murderer who killed Clark Bishop's

07:32.720 --> 07:35.920
parents and love.

07:35.920 --> 07:43.040
There is a mugshot of a woman smiling, a cold, vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs covering

07:43.040 --> 07:44.720
one of her eyes.

07:44.720 --> 07:51.560
Written in Sharpie, underneath the mugshot, it says in all caps, Karen.

07:51.560 --> 07:56.520
Your vision readjusts, and you are standing in the mid-morning sunlight near your partners,

07:56.520 --> 08:03.160
Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna, in the wake of a funeral gone terribly awry.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.160
That was, uh, that's one hell of an info dump.

08:06.160 --> 08:12.040
Zach, you will be pleased to know that I already have, um, Am Love and Karen written down in

08:12.040 --> 08:13.040
my notes.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.040
Oh, yes please!

08:14.040 --> 08:19.700
But I don't expect the listeners to remember all the fucking shit that happened to John

08:19.700 --> 08:22.360
Lee Pettymore four or five episodes ago.

08:22.360 --> 08:23.360
Sure.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.360
Because I didn't.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.920
Had to go back in and listen to that?

08:25.920 --> 08:29.080
Had to listen to it again and wrote it all down on my phone.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.080
Absolutely.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.120
So, uh, with that I need you to lose ten luck.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.960
Uh, let me find my character sheet.

08:34.960 --> 08:35.960
Luck.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.640
Okay, I'm at twenty luck now.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.100
Down to twenty luck.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.680
No longer able to survive if you die.

08:41.680 --> 08:44.920
But I can avoid major damage and some other things.

08:44.920 --> 08:48.160
Alrighty, let's get the other boys in the room and kick this thing off.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.160
Let's do it.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.160
Ramona.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.160
Ramona.

08:51.160 --> 08:52.160
Ramona.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.160
Ramona.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.160
Ramona.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.160
Ramona.

08:55.660 --> 08:55.760
Ramona.

08:55.760 --> 08:56.260
Ramona.

08:56.260 --> 08:57.080
Ramona.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.700
Ramona.

08:58.700 --> 08:59.860
Meow meow meow!

08:59.860 --> 09:00.460
Ramona!

09:00.460 --> 09:00.960
Woof!

09:11.780 --> 09:12.800
Oh my goodness.

09:13.800 --> 09:25.840
I think we can get him on the podcast.

09:25.840 --> 09:26.640
He's probably dead.

09:27.200 --> 09:31.240
I bet it's pretty easy to get the Numa Numa guy on the podcast if he's not dead.

09:31.560 --> 09:32.720
What do you think he's up to these days?

09:32.760 --> 09:36.600
He's either dead or he's making shitty podcast appearances.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.840
He was a question on Ask Me Another a couple of weeks ago.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.320
The Numa Numa guy was the answer?

09:42.360 --> 09:42.680
Yeah.

09:42.680 --> 09:43.080
Nice.

09:43.160 --> 09:44.840
Did they accept the Numa Numa guy?

09:44.840 --> 09:45.720
Was that the answer?

09:45.720 --> 09:47.080
Or did they have to know his name or something?

09:47.080 --> 09:47.920
Oh no, it was the Jimi.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.160
You had to know Boris Fonks-Kold.

09:50.200 --> 09:50.840
Yeah, right.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.200
His name is actually Dr.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.320
Carbuncle McPhee.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.640
Little shout out to the Patreon listeners.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.560
Yeah, last week.

10:01.560 --> 10:01.920
Dr.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.000
Carbohydrate Uncle.

10:03.040 --> 10:10.080
On Monday, we released our second Patreon exclusive episode in which we played Everyone is John.

10:10.160 --> 10:10.880
It was delightful.

10:10.880 --> 10:11.560
It was a lot of fun.

10:11.920 --> 10:16.600
It's where we all play John Peters in the moments before his death.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.440
In the moments before he turns into a dog.

10:18.440 --> 10:19.960
You try to save John Peters.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.280
Let's play this dang old game.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.800
I'm going to vape in the mic real quick.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.160
Throwback to the old days.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.640
Man, I wish you wouldn't do that.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.240
We didn't even do that in the old days.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.000
It's on, I think, the first episode.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.440
Yeah, and you're instantly reprimanded.

10:38.440 --> 10:49.880
Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop, you look over and the eyes that have rolled back into the back of John's head are now right back where eyes normally are.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.320
And he looks at you with a startle.

10:52.520 --> 10:53.840
John, what's going on?

10:55.240 --> 10:55.840
A lot.

10:57.120 --> 10:57.480
What?

10:57.560 --> 10:57.920
Yeah.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.280
Are you, are you with us?

10:59.920 --> 11:06.280
All right, well, so boys, I don't know how to tell you, but I think I developed the second set.

11:06.680 --> 11:12.680
At least I believe I developed the second site in my transition from John to Kevin.

11:12.720 --> 11:13.600
What did you just see?

11:13.880 --> 11:20.240
Perhaps I just unlocked something I always had within me, but I feel slightly less lucky.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.320
And here's what I saw.

11:24.840 --> 11:28.040
I saw, I saw a motel safe and hotel motel.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.320
Oh, shit.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.320
I saw Bean's pond behind Maggie's house.

11:33.080 --> 11:43.240
I saw television blinking random letters, perhaps not so random, and I saw a small clearing in the woods where the ground was scorched.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.320
I saw some other things, too.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.880
Marvin Glass has the camera.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.880
It's currently in his possession.

11:55.480 --> 12:01.160
What else I saw was perhaps too terrible to repeat right now.

12:02.160 --> 12:08.040
I know what you saw, the lockbox, the safe at hotel motel.

12:08.440 --> 12:08.760
Yeah.

12:09.280 --> 12:13.280
I have, I have my brother's watch in there.

12:14.880 --> 12:25.120
I got it after his unfortunate demise, but I put it on and some real weird shit happened.

12:25.120 --> 12:29.720
I felt like I was like on an alternate plane while I had it on and I knew I had to take it off.

12:30.240 --> 12:36.400
I know it means something, but I, I couldn't have it on my body cause it was just doing some fucked up shit.

12:36.400 --> 12:40.160
So I threw it in my safe in my hotel motel room.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.520
Keith, can you describe that alternate plane?

12:44.280 --> 12:46.480
Was it as though the ground were made of light?

12:47.800 --> 12:53.320
No, I just, I, it's not that it took me physically somewhere else.

12:53.320 --> 13:00.560
I was still in contention or around there, but in my mind I was seeing different stuff.

13:01.360 --> 13:08.000
It was hard to decipher what was real and what I was seeing, but I knew it was something, it just felt evil.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.760
And I had to throw it in that safe cause I thought the longer I had it on the weirdest shit was going to happen.

13:13.760 --> 13:19.200
And I it's, it means something I'm sure, but we'll, we'll have to go check that out.

13:19.200 --> 13:23.760
And I think with the three of us together, cause I was by myself when I had it on.

13:23.760 --> 13:29.400
So I think had I had it on just by myself for a while, I might've gone insane or something.

13:29.440 --> 13:32.520
That, uh, that watch didn't have tubes like all of our other objects.

13:32.520 --> 13:37.560
No, it's just a, just looks like a nice, like gold Rolex watch.

13:37.880 --> 13:40.040
Does being spawn mean anything to y'all?

13:41.480 --> 13:47.360
I mean, it's at behind Maggie's house and yeah, I just, I believe I have the second side.

13:48.240 --> 14:01.200
And when I thought about the objects, these are the things I saw and I saw Marvin glass with the camera, but then I don't know, it sounds like Keith's describing an object of, of power that he put in that safe.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.240
What can be in these other places?

14:04.400 --> 14:09.560
The, uh, those letters on the television, did you, uh, you have to remember them?

14:09.640 --> 14:17.080
I do R S T N L N E.

14:17.880 --> 14:21.800
What were you saying that right or wrong?

14:28.320 --> 14:35.520
Cause I said S and you said L, but I have a T there's an L in there though in there after the T I know, I know what those are.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.360
John and Keith, you even might know what those are.

14:38.440 --> 14:39.680
R S T L N E.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.200
Well, that's the wheel of fortune letters.

14:43.320 --> 14:43.960
Exactly.

14:43.960 --> 14:49.360
They're the letters they give you at the end of wheel of fortune, but that's, that's not all fellas.

14:52.560 --> 14:52.960
Yeah.

14:55.040 --> 14:55.440
Wow.

14:55.520 --> 15:06.120
I never would have imagined when I, uh, fellas, when I came to, I, uh, well, Keith, you don't, Keith, I got to show you something.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.240
Clark pulls up his shirt and shows Keith.

15:08.280 --> 15:08.960
Holy shit.

15:09.000 --> 15:09.360
All right.

15:10.360 --> 15:10.720
Keith.

15:10.720 --> 15:22.440
When Clark lifts up his shirt, you see that there is a hole in Clark's chest as if his body has been gauged like an earlobe.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.120
So it's kind of healed over through.

15:24.160 --> 15:29.080
Can I see all the way through skin tunnel leading you through his body.

15:29.120 --> 15:38.800
When I woke up with this, I had a, I had a bag with me and there was, there was, well, I, what I think is my heart.

15:39.120 --> 15:45.840
In the bag with ice, but next to it was another bag and it had those letters in it.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.000
That's fucked up, man.

15:48.040 --> 15:52.280
It's somebody who knew that I watched wheel of fortune every night.

15:55.040 --> 15:55.480
Well, okay.

15:55.480 --> 15:56.920
Well, that looks all right.

15:56.920 --> 16:04.560
So one thing I also saw, uh, Marvin glass knows a lot more about us than we might've originally suspected.

16:04.560 --> 16:08.640
Um, he knows a lot.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.520
He knows everything about your history.

16:10.880 --> 16:11.600
Oh shit.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.040
Clark, I've got something to tell you.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.560
I don't, you might already know.

16:17.080 --> 16:20.040
All right, boys, let me actually start at the beginning.

16:22.200 --> 16:28.560
We're not the first group of three to try to combat this kind of stuff.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.560
What do you mean before us?

16:32.560 --> 16:34.520
There was a group called K cell.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.760
K cell was Kevin.

16:37.120 --> 16:41.760
You see standing before you, your, your father adopted father.

16:41.800 --> 16:42.320
Yeah.

16:43.000 --> 16:43.600
What?

16:43.920 --> 16:52.680
So it was Kevin man named Kyle and a woman named Karen, also known as an love.

16:54.240 --> 16:57.160
What the and love killed your parents.

16:57.880 --> 17:03.440
Clark stares in bewilderment and a little bit of like anger just at here in the name.

17:03.880 --> 17:09.320
I don't know why Marvin glass turned the grip against itself.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.040
And Karen was the only one to get away.

17:12.920 --> 17:22.720
He made Kevin shoot Kyle and, and he essentially took over, took over his life, his soul in some way.

17:22.920 --> 17:26.200
And Kevin was his soldier from then on out.

17:27.160 --> 17:31.360
Marvin glass was looking for, for the metal sphere.

17:31.680 --> 17:32.480
He has one.

17:32.520 --> 17:36.960
That's what agent McKinley and Kennedy were trying to neutralize was a silver ball like that.

17:37.000 --> 17:37.360
Yeah.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.240
Why does he want them?

17:38.880 --> 17:39.560
I don't know.

17:39.840 --> 17:40.680
I saw something.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.080
I saw something pretty terrible.

17:44.080 --> 17:47.520
Just now, all these people want these fears.

17:47.560 --> 17:50.880
We found one Marvin glass was one on one for years.

17:50.880 --> 17:51.560
He has one.

17:51.560 --> 17:52.840
He wants to know how it works.

17:53.800 --> 17:58.240
Just now, just now I had a vision of something, something strange and terrible.

17:59.040 --> 18:05.480
It was like one of those fears, but massive, gigantic, gargantuan.

18:07.480 --> 18:14.840
It had arms coming out the side and a little tube coming up the bottom and up that tube.

18:14.840 --> 18:23.400
I watched one of those fears go one of the small spheres and a, a huge light opened up in the ceiling.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.600
It was like the ceiling was, was revealing itself.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.440
So this thing could, could come through.

18:29.600 --> 18:37.120
And all around I saw these letters, these words, it said planet juggernaut like that.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.880
Fucking the bedding stuff we found.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.520
Yeah, exactly.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.240
Keith Clark.

18:42.240 --> 18:46.200
Sorry, sorry.

18:46.200 --> 18:51.920
The transition to my new body is a wrecked havoc on some of my neurons.

18:53.760 --> 18:56.280
I don't even know if I have neurons really.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.040
Shouldn't I have this asshole's memories?

18:59.600 --> 19:01.520
Do I have this asshole's memories?

19:01.560 --> 19:04.040
I'll try to access this asshole's memories.

19:04.040 --> 19:18.800
While not being able to access the memories of Kevin, previous to you being inside of his body, you think that that might be a hint as to why you have, quote, the second sight.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.120
Interesting.

19:20.280 --> 19:24.600
Guys, I was just, I'm thinking about what we heard Stan talking about earlier.

19:24.840 --> 19:25.480
Oh yeah.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.120
Thinking about it more.

19:28.120 --> 19:39.040
When I had Fergie's watch on, I remember, well, it clouded my mind cause I felt like I was going inside, inside, inside in the membrane, inside in the brain.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.600
That's how Chick-fil-A makes their chicken.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.920
Oh, that sounds good.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.800
Uh, I remember it's coming back to me.

19:46.800 --> 19:54.120
I, when I had it on one of the feelings I had was like, I felt like wet grass and dirt on my fingers.

19:54.120 --> 20:02.920
And I remember seeing a metal door, like buried almost slightly underneath this grass and, and, and dirt.

20:02.960 --> 20:09.520
And it said, here lies the beans, scientists beyond measure, saviors of the world.

20:09.760 --> 20:18.160
And as soon as I saw that, I think that's when I had ripped the watch off of my arm and went and thrown it into the safe.

20:19.160 --> 20:22.560
So like, are you more capable than you've been letting on?

20:23.560 --> 20:25.120
Are you a scientist without measure?

20:27.720 --> 20:28.240
No.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.440
Do you feel that within yourself?

20:36.760 --> 20:44.320
I am almost positive that somewhere along the beans line, there's something I don't know.

20:44.360 --> 20:45.560
It could be my parents.

20:45.560 --> 20:51.120
It could be my grandparents, but it was somebody related to you that came in and solved their.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.440
Uh, Silas and Mary Cole problem back in the day.

20:54.480 --> 20:58.400
It was, it was Cornelius beans and somewhere down the line.

20:58.400 --> 21:07.480
I don't know who would have been the scientist, but we, I don't know where to find whatever I saw in that, but I feel as if it's real.

21:07.480 --> 21:11.200
And we, I think maybe there's something in that that we need to check out.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.320
I might know a little bit, something about that.

21:14.520 --> 21:15.120
What do you think?

21:15.400 --> 21:19.200
Well, I know that I personally came from Cole's orphanage.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.840
John Lee Pettymore, the third adopted me from there.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.160
I don't know who my real parents are.

21:25.360 --> 21:29.880
Cole's orphanage, new school under modern etiquette.

21:29.960 --> 21:34.640
So Kevin, John, everything you're saying right now is going a little bit above my head.

21:34.640 --> 21:40.720
You're adopted by John Lee Pettymore, but you're in Kevin's body, but you're in your dad's body.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.200
The only, Oh, right.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.880
John Lee Pettymore, the third is Kevin.

21:44.760 --> 21:47.640
He was part of K cell remember, but here's the point.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.600
I think maybe the beans adopted you too.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.600
I think maybe we all spent some time in Cole's orphanage.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.480
No, my parents are my parents.

21:57.520 --> 21:58.680
How can you be so sure?

21:58.720 --> 21:59.920
They were my parents, Keith.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.440
How are you sure about anything?

22:01.480 --> 22:04.600
You know what we've been through the past six fucking days.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.520
How can you be sure of anything?

22:06.520 --> 22:07.720
I'm not sure of anything.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.080
I'm sure they were my parents.

22:10.080 --> 22:15.960
Keith, they had to have been, you know, my daddy was my daddy.

22:16.640 --> 22:18.000
And your daddy is your daddy.

22:18.280 --> 22:21.360
We just came from different penises.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.320
Then the ones what raised us.

22:27.400 --> 22:28.360
Where were we?

22:30.160 --> 22:32.040
My brother from another penis.

22:34.680 --> 22:38.240
Where were we when we had that spell cast on us as children?

22:38.480 --> 22:42.120
Oh, that was, that was at clankers at the daycare daycare.

22:42.120 --> 22:42.440
Yeah.

22:42.480 --> 22:42.760
Okay.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.560
Well, why were we all at that same daycare together?

22:46.200 --> 22:49.200
If we might not have all come from the same orphanage.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.080
You ever think about that Clark?

22:51.480 --> 22:54.080
I mean, here's the only daycare in town.

22:54.080 --> 22:57.680
I just figured, yeah, that one's that's a little tough to say.

22:57.680 --> 23:01.000
Cause it's not like there's not great childcare options and contention.

23:02.440 --> 23:03.800
It's it's the bar.

23:04.760 --> 23:05.600
It's the bar.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.000
Like they're the only ones willing to do it.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.200
I love cut up hot dogs and Bud Light.

23:10.240 --> 23:10.600
I see.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.520
That's that's a,

23:12.000 --> 23:13.560
I'll always have a soft spot.

23:16.720 --> 23:16.880
Yeah.

23:16.880 --> 23:20.000
What are you going to ask someone who's not Harry clinker to watch your kids?

23:21.440 --> 23:22.440
What would Harry say?

23:22.440 --> 23:24.440
He's the best one for the job.

23:24.440 --> 23:28.400
Obviously it'd be crushed 36.

23:28.440 --> 23:34.880
John, do you shout out, John, do you have any, do you see anything else or that's a lot of information to take in, but I think

23:34.880 --> 23:39.880
I know it's like an info dump, but Keith, I got to, I got to ask you something.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.560
It's, it's kind of tough though.

23:42.040 --> 23:42.320
Yeah.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.520
Well, I've had a tough week, so I think I can handle.

23:45.600 --> 23:54.200
You know, my, my memory has been pretty dang spotty lately, but one of the last things I do remember was we were

23:54.200 --> 24:01.720
standing in Glass's office and boy, it sounded an awful lot like he hired you to kill your brother.

24:03.320 --> 24:05.640
And you, you, you asked where the money was.

24:07.480 --> 24:12.080
Well, since, I mean, we're all working together again.

24:13.080 --> 24:22.880
I don't know what the point in hiding this from you is anymore, but, uh, I didn't know that it was Marvin Glass hiring me to do this.

24:22.880 --> 24:30.880
My, my niece, she found me and she offered me a million dollars to kill her dad.

24:31.320 --> 24:39.920
And I don't know that I've talked a lot about Fergie, but, uh, it's not, it's common knowledge that him and I didn't get along

24:40.200 --> 24:42.080
since, since we were boys.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.280
In fact, I hated him.

24:43.560 --> 24:52.200
And so when that opportunity rose, I never thought about killing my brother, but the chance to become a millionaire and get rid of that asshole.

24:52.440 --> 24:53.200
I jumped at it.

24:54.320 --> 25:03.400
So I went and, uh, I didn't kill my brother, but I guess you could say if it wasn't for me, he'd still be alive today.

25:03.400 --> 25:11.560
So, uh, when I saw my niece with Marvin Glass and the scientist lady, I knew what I got myself into.

25:11.680 --> 25:13.560
Did you recognize that scientist lady?

25:13.560 --> 25:14.640
Was she anybody to you?

25:14.680 --> 25:18.960
Only person in that glass building I knew was my niece.

25:19.400 --> 25:22.520
I had no idea she was affiliated with people like that.

25:22.920 --> 25:32.960
Keith, uh, I happened to encounter your niece's, your niece's bedroom and she's getting up to all kinds of weird, impossible math.

25:33.920 --> 25:40.080
Does that sound, yeah, she, she was, she was writing out equations that couldn't have been from this world.

25:40.120 --> 25:43.440
Well, you know, if there's anything you want your niece to be into math, isn't that bad?

25:43.480 --> 25:45.080
Yeah, it could be worse.

25:46.280 --> 25:47.640
It could be one letter off.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.360
Uh, no, the thing is, I don't know much.

25:51.400 --> 25:57.440
I haven't been, I hadn't, I have not been in contact with my niece.

25:57.480 --> 26:02.160
It seemed at the time that, uh, that, that scientist lady was maybe training her in some way.

26:02.200 --> 26:07.520
I mean, I kind of got that idea too, but I was mostly just pissed off that I've, I think they were trying to screw me.

26:07.560 --> 26:10.800
I don't think they had any intent on giving me that million dollars.

26:10.800 --> 26:18.960
That's the reason I was even going to work for Marvin was to repay the debt of him rebuilding me.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.880
And he said, he'd give me that million dollars.

26:21.720 --> 26:24.040
Keith, did you know you was saved by fish men?

26:24.160 --> 26:27.360
I, I, yes, I saw them.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.520
And what do you think about, what do you think about that?

26:30.480 --> 26:33.800
Uh, I don't know what you think made them fish, man.

26:33.800 --> 26:39.960
Can we get, I just saw a reaction shot from Clark bishops, fish, man.

26:42.040 --> 26:50.120
My already spinning head is spinning even while more wildly fish, fish, man, man with the face of fishes.

26:50.160 --> 26:54.160
So I saw, I was much more concerned about getting out of glasses building.

26:54.240 --> 26:58.520
I saw them and it freaked me the fuck out, but I did get help from a fish boy.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.280
Uh, so they're not all bad.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.880
They're doing some weird shit over in that glass building.

27:07.880 --> 27:11.880
I assure you, I can't, I don't fucking know.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.000
I got the, I got out of there.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.600
I accepted, I accepted the proposition from Marvin glass and I came to the funeral.

27:18.600 --> 27:19.400
That's all I know.

27:19.840 --> 27:25.000
Fish boy, you were talking to a fish boy, Peter, little Peter.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.200
Oh my God.

27:26.200 --> 27:29.080
God, my God.

27:30.920 --> 27:34.600
What are fish, what are fish people doing?

27:34.640 --> 27:40.920
I don't know, but they apparently, I don't know how I got rebuilt other than the power of Marvin glass.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.280
You keep saying rebuilt.

27:42.280 --> 27:43.760
I mean, what does that even mean?

27:43.760 --> 27:44.600
I died.

27:44.640 --> 27:45.000
Yeah.

27:45.000 --> 27:45.600
I'm back.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.520
I said he was the new Charles.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.000
You want to know how I got these scars?

27:53.000 --> 27:53.760
That's a big one.

27:53.800 --> 27:54.840
You got on your hand there.

27:54.920 --> 27:55.320
Yeah.

27:55.400 --> 27:55.760
Clark.

27:55.760 --> 27:57.160
That'll come into play later.

27:57.320 --> 28:01.160
Are you not going to give him credit for shouting out our favorite movie in the precinct?

28:02.480 --> 28:04.360
The one we all used to watch together.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.280
Ace Ventura, pet detective.

28:06.320 --> 28:06.800
No.

28:06.840 --> 28:07.840
Batman forever.

28:07.880 --> 28:08.400
That one.

28:11.560 --> 28:13.840
You guys, obviously you can see the scars.

28:14.200 --> 28:17.720
I'm not exactly sure what's going on in here.

28:17.840 --> 28:22.840
Uh, I have a slight idea, but, uh, I, I don't know.

28:22.840 --> 28:28.120
I don't want, I don't really want to talk about it until I figure it out, but I don't, there's nothing you need to worry about.

28:28.280 --> 28:29.160
I'm on your side.

28:29.160 --> 28:29.680
I promise.

28:30.760 --> 28:36.720
And that sounds, that sounds real suspicious, but I mean it, I promise we talked about this already.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.840
John Kevin's eyes, narrow.

28:40.200 --> 28:49.360
John, you mentioned that, uh, that those silver balls that everybody's apparently after that you said something about Marvin wanting to use it.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.720
Do you know what that means?

28:50.880 --> 28:59.080
Years ago when, when Marvin turned Kevin on Kyle, the thing you wanted to know was how the balls worked, what they did.

28:59.560 --> 29:05.080
I haven't seen anything suggesting what that is other than making the big ball work.

29:05.240 --> 29:13.880
Do you think that there might be some of those silver balls in the silver in the gun and the camera and the radio and the helmet?

29:14.120 --> 29:15.000
That's interesting.

29:15.680 --> 29:18.320
I hadn't thought of that Keith, but I mean, who knows?

29:18.360 --> 29:21.560
We, we considered them pretty important, so we never cracked them open.

29:21.560 --> 29:25.160
But I don't know that we should, but we've only got one correct.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.680
We've got the ball, one silver ball, right?

29:27.680 --> 29:32.800
We put our, it disappeared into our bag, but I think that bag is still, it wasn't ours.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.400
The agents brought one.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.080
We got one.

29:35.200 --> 29:38.120
I think it's still in the skull of that lady, right?

29:38.160 --> 29:40.360
No, John has it.

29:41.000 --> 29:41.520
You do?

29:42.080 --> 29:45.800
John just picked it up and he's had it ever since.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.520
Is it at your house or?

29:48.320 --> 29:53.600
No, I don't know how much that's my house anymore.

29:54.240 --> 29:59.320
I mean, I still like Smokey, but, uh, here's the thing boys.

30:00.240 --> 30:03.040
That was kind of always on my person.

30:03.440 --> 30:04.920
I just had it in my pocket.

30:06.120 --> 30:08.880
I didn't, it was a comforting wait.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.200
I didn't know what it did.

30:11.040 --> 30:15.600
Uh, so you're saying it was on the old John, it was on John, your previous John.

30:16.120 --> 30:18.320
So Marvin has it.

30:18.360 --> 30:19.440
Most likely.

30:19.480 --> 30:20.280
Yes.

30:21.800 --> 30:25.280
You know, a lot, a lot's happened in a real short amount of time.

30:25.840 --> 30:27.160
Real, real quick for us.

30:27.200 --> 30:27.600
Sure.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.320
Absolutely.

30:28.360 --> 30:32.800
It could get a little head spinning, but, uh, agent, uh, McKinley and agent Kennedy,

30:32.800 --> 30:38.200
they, they tasked us with neutralizing the threat, I believe was part of their MO.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.440
And then we were supposed to call them back there.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.000
They're twisting in the wind right now.

30:42.000 --> 30:42.920
As far as I know.

30:43.000 --> 30:43.240
Yeah.

30:43.280 --> 30:45.000
Shouldn't they be doing something?

30:45.040 --> 30:46.520
Who do they work for?

30:46.520 --> 30:47.600
Are they on the glass?

30:47.600 --> 30:50.320
Well, they said the FBI, but who knows?

30:50.840 --> 30:53.560
Also, it's been a hell of a week.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.680
I had all my days of running together.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.440
How long ago was it that we saw agent McKinley two days ago?

31:00.440 --> 31:06.560
What did they, they, they said if we didn't call back in 48 hours, they'd call us.

31:06.600 --> 31:12.320
You would assume based on the timing that it is right about now that they would be

31:12.360 --> 31:15.000
calling the contention police department.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.880
Um, and I'm all out of minutes.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.880
I want to get you guys, I want to call drew real quick.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.160
You've been in touch with drew.

31:21.360 --> 31:24.240
He was, he said he, I have not in voicemail.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.240
Yeah, but I want to call him and see if they'll answer.

31:26.280 --> 31:29.600
You called him after you listened to the voicemail that he sent.

31:29.680 --> 31:34.080
And I believe his phone went straight to voicemail.

31:34.120 --> 31:34.480
Yep.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.960
And I want to try it again.

31:36.360 --> 31:43.840
Bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, and it does the same this time.

31:44.040 --> 31:46.520
Well, so did they say they'd call the police department?

31:46.520 --> 31:47.800
I think we were supposed to call them.

31:47.800 --> 31:52.520
They gave us a number that we could, but they said if we didn't call within 48

31:52.520 --> 31:54.200
hours, they'd be in contact with us.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.240
I think that was the deal.

31:56.200 --> 32:00.600
Hopefully they have their self, our cell phone numbers then I don't have any idea

32:00.600 --> 32:02.840
where that card with their number would be.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.240
I mean, we would just have their number.

32:04.320 --> 32:10.160
I mean, what if we just all go in and start a fucking, you know, like hot wings

32:10.160 --> 32:13.920
restaurant or something and let them take care of contention.

32:14.120 --> 32:15.800
They were going to come back in two days.

32:15.840 --> 32:18.600
We've got alibis, new lives.

32:18.640 --> 32:19.440
We disappeared.

32:19.480 --> 32:22.080
If they're working for glass, that's a hot wings.

32:23.680 --> 32:26.960
Well, if they're working for glass, I don't think they would have given us that

32:26.960 --> 32:29.160
bag that gets rid of the balls.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.560
They would have taken it unless those balls get sent.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.520
If they get put in the bag, they get sent to the thing that John saw.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.480
I don't know why they would have left the bag with us.

32:36.520 --> 32:37.880
That's an interesting proposition.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.240
We would be doing their job for them.

32:39.240 --> 32:42.040
If they're working for glass, we'd find some balls and keep putting them in the

32:42.040 --> 32:43.240
bag and they keep going to the...

32:43.240 --> 32:46.240
Now maybe, but it seemed like they was awfully scared of those balls.

32:46.240 --> 32:48.040
What if we gave them a call?

32:49.560 --> 32:50.520
We've got their card.

32:50.520 --> 32:51.400
We got their number.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.280
What's the worst that can happen?

32:54.280 --> 32:56.360
We can try to decide whether we trust them or not.

32:59.040 --> 33:00.160
What do you guys think?

33:00.320 --> 33:04.240
Both of Joe and Clark don't know about that.

33:04.240 --> 33:08.600
And Keith, I mean, who knows who they are though now.

33:08.640 --> 33:11.520
It's going to be a couple hours till they get in contact with us.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.640
They told us that we might as well give them a call.

33:13.640 --> 33:18.920
See, I don't know that we have the upper hand, but if we have any sort of, if we're

33:18.920 --> 33:23.000
doubting that we can trust them, you know, we can call them and see what they're

33:23.000 --> 33:23.360
saying.

33:23.360 --> 33:27.640
And we might try to be able to get something out of them because we know about

33:27.640 --> 33:28.600
glass and everything.

33:28.600 --> 33:32.280
We might be able to get something out of them before they can, you know, get to us.

33:32.360 --> 33:36.440
Let's, let's, let's take a step back now fellas, now that we've laid all our cards

33:36.440 --> 33:37.040
on the table.

33:37.040 --> 33:41.440
What, what do we want to do to, to prevent calamity?

33:41.600 --> 33:47.040
I mean, a lot has changed, but it sounds like the glass family has some real bad

33:47.040 --> 33:49.080
designs on the town of contention.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.400
I've seen things that make me think the world's in jeopardy.

33:53.200 --> 33:57.280
You have the glass family after you had maybe the glass family is our, our first

33:57.320 --> 33:57.840
thing.

33:57.840 --> 34:01.520
The glass, the glass family thinks you're still one of them.

34:01.760 --> 34:03.320
They might still think I'm one of them.

34:03.520 --> 34:08.000
And that's thing is neither of us killed Stan Manstein.

34:08.400 --> 34:12.680
No, I'm out of failed my mission of bringing Stan back, but I didn't kill him.

34:12.680 --> 34:16.560
So I may, I wouldn't have to infiltrate the glass building.

34:16.560 --> 34:21.560
I could just go in maybe under the guise of bringing the guy that killed Stan

34:21.840 --> 34:25.240
Manstein in, and then we can, we're all three in there.

34:25.240 --> 34:28.680
And if shit goes awry, then we can, uh, I liked that a lot.

34:28.720 --> 34:30.760
You're going to use Clark Bishop as your Chewbacca.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.080
Yeah, absolutely.

34:32.120 --> 34:37.120
This is the man who killed Stan Manstein and we brought him and then we use him

34:37.680 --> 34:39.200
to kill Marvin glass.

34:39.200 --> 34:40.040
I like that.

34:40.240 --> 34:41.800
I mean, fuck Marvin glass.

34:41.800 --> 34:46.160
And I think I'm on board for this plan, but just for the record, I don't know if

34:46.160 --> 34:47.200
we killed Stan.

34:47.240 --> 34:48.640
Well, he's not here.

34:48.680 --> 34:51.640
I don't know that he died, but he blipped out of existence.

34:51.640 --> 34:52.080
Keith.

34:52.120 --> 34:57.120
My task was to bring him back and that is seems like an impossible task.

34:57.320 --> 34:59.080
Now it seems like I failed to do that.

34:59.080 --> 35:03.040
So yeah, we'll just tell Marvin glass that you're the man who killed Stan

35:03.040 --> 35:03.680
Manstein.

35:03.720 --> 35:08.280
I think before we do this though, I would like to call the, uh, quote,

35:08.280 --> 35:12.560
unquote FBI people back and just see what, see what they say.

35:13.200 --> 35:18.440
Cause if you're talking about case cell, was that an FBI thing or do you know

35:18.440 --> 35:19.360
what that means?

35:19.560 --> 35:21.320
No, man, that was an FBI.

35:21.440 --> 35:24.600
Well, maybe these, maybe these people know what the case cell is.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.240
Maybe they're somehow affiliated with that.

35:27.280 --> 35:29.000
Do we know who the case will work for?

35:29.040 --> 35:30.080
It sounds like the case.

35:30.080 --> 35:33.640
So was doing the same kind of stuff we were doing, right?

35:33.960 --> 35:38.320
Except maybe they were more, I mean, prepared for it than we were.

35:38.400 --> 35:42.200
And if these FBI guys are at the end of the day, we're still contention

35:42.200 --> 35:43.240
police officers.

35:43.240 --> 35:48.080
We're not, well, we're, I mean, maybe not anymore, but what do you think

35:48.080 --> 35:49.440
about just giving them a call?

35:49.520 --> 35:50.760
We don't have to meet up with them.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.800
We don't have to tell them everything we know, but I'd like to see what they

35:53.800 --> 35:55.360
think when we call them back.

35:55.400 --> 35:59.200
Cause I think they're the ones that really made us knowledgeable about the

35:59.200 --> 36:01.080
weird shit that's going down.

36:01.120 --> 36:03.240
I mean, we saw it with our own eyes, but they're the ones that

36:03.240 --> 36:04.560
confirmed that it's happening.

36:04.680 --> 36:07.240
They're the ones who confirmed that somebody else knew about it.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.680
I don't see that they've helped us a damn at all.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.680
Well, they gave us the bag.

36:11.720 --> 36:13.240
I don't know if it helped.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.480
I mean, we could be helping them inadvertently, but you're right.

36:15.520 --> 36:16.600
I mean, or I'm right.

36:16.920 --> 36:20.640
It seemed like they were at least offering the branch to help ourselves.

36:20.640 --> 36:22.200
What is the harm in calling them?

36:22.200 --> 36:25.080
And if we feel like we can't trust them, we just go about our business.

36:25.080 --> 36:28.360
We don't fuck with them, but I don't, I don't think there is a harm in calling

36:28.360 --> 36:32.880
them, but they might break some of the element of surprise if we, if we're

36:32.880 --> 36:36.880
trying to do a, a Darren raid on Marvin glasses, we don't have to tell them that

36:36.880 --> 36:40.600
we're doing that we need, I'm saying just get in contact with them, see what they

36:40.600 --> 36:42.360
have to offer and we go from there.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.080
We'll have to put on objection to that.

36:44.120 --> 36:47.480
We'll have to, yeah, we'll just have to put on our acting pants and make sure

36:47.480 --> 36:52.000
that they don't know that we know things about them that you were in

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
theater in high school.

36:53.000 --> 36:57.400
I remember, I think maybe you should be the one to field the call.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.280
Oh no.

36:59.960 --> 37:02.480
Whoever has the highest alertness.

37:02.520 --> 37:05.160
I need you to roll alertness for me.

37:05.160 --> 37:06.680
Read, read them off guys.

37:07.720 --> 37:08.640
A couple of tins.

37:08.720 --> 37:09.040
I'm sorry.

37:09.040 --> 37:09.200
What?

37:09.200 --> 37:10.640
Who has the highest alertness?

37:10.640 --> 37:11.440
A 70.

37:11.520 --> 37:12.240
Ooh.

37:12.320 --> 37:15.440
All right, Joe, go ahead and roll alertness for me.

37:17.480 --> 37:21.080
That's an 89.

37:21.080 --> 37:27.000
89 continued speaking to your fellow police officers, whips his head

37:27.000 --> 37:28.520
around every direction he can.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.280
Clark does no such thing.

37:34.720 --> 37:38.680
Uh, yeah, so we call, we call the FBI and we just see what they know.

37:38.760 --> 37:43.520
I mean the, uh, the in heavy air quotes, FBI, I have to say we give them a little

37:43.520 --> 37:47.240
bit of info, but we by no means tell them everything we know.

37:47.280 --> 37:48.800
Well, let's run that down real quick.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.200
Like what do we, what do we want?

37:50.240 --> 37:53.280
So we're going to be calling them and telling them that we failed.

37:53.320 --> 37:56.600
We, I mean, 48 hours has passed and we haven't neutralized the threat.

37:56.600 --> 37:57.960
Is that what we should lead with?

37:57.960 --> 37:59.000
Or I think so.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.360
And then maybe though, well, maybe, or maybe we, you know, we

38:03.360 --> 38:04.920
found the threat was much bigger.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.040
I mean, both.

38:06.080 --> 38:06.440
Yeah.

38:06.520 --> 38:06.920
Yeah.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.920
Or, yeah, it was something that there's no way we could have tackled

38:09.920 --> 38:12.160
in 48 hours had even if we'd known.

38:12.200 --> 38:15.680
I mean, that's why there's, that's why they said if you finish it in 48 hours,

38:16.080 --> 38:16.560
good.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.640
Otherwise call us.

38:17.680 --> 38:21.480
Well, they might even still think that we're in contention dealing with that.

38:21.520 --> 38:25.200
Cause I think we've moved on to bigger things outside of contention.

38:25.200 --> 38:27.760
We can pretend to be still in contention when we call them.

38:28.080 --> 38:29.520
I don't know if that'll do us any good.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.720
I think we should just be straight forward with these people.

38:31.720 --> 38:34.480
I don't know who the fuck they are, but they're not Marvin glass.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.240
So I think they're probably better than what we're dealing with right now.

38:37.280 --> 38:38.240
We're just, that's the thing.

38:38.240 --> 38:39.880
We're hoping they're not Marvin glass.

38:40.040 --> 38:45.560
I say we, I say we feed them one, one major line instead of all the details

38:45.560 --> 38:47.920
and then see what their reaction is to it.

38:48.040 --> 38:50.040
What is the major thing we talked to him about that?

38:50.040 --> 38:52.920
Well, we'll have to, yeah, we'll conduct the conversation with.

38:53.920 --> 38:55.360
Suave and effortless.

38:55.520 --> 39:00.000
Yeah, but what's the, what are we going to tell him?

39:00.040 --> 39:02.720
We'll say like, we got that fool Marvin glass.

39:02.760 --> 39:04.000
How do you feel about that?

39:05.200 --> 39:06.320
Let's see how they react.

39:07.120 --> 39:10.720
And then when they react appropriately, then we tell them we're lying.

39:10.760 --> 39:11.240
Sorry.

39:11.240 --> 39:14.080
No, actually we don't have them, but we could really use your help.

39:14.080 --> 39:17.120
Well, if they're working for glass, they would know we don't have glass,

39:17.120 --> 39:18.600
but I get the, I get what you mean.

39:21.840 --> 39:28.720
You hear this absurd scream coming from on top of one of the crypts that is

39:28.720 --> 39:34.160
nearby and surrounding you and looking over, you see this massive creature

39:34.360 --> 39:37.200
begin to materialize in front of you.

39:37.560 --> 39:43.800
And it is a six and a half to seven feet tall creature with long limbs.

39:43.840 --> 39:49.840
And it is gaunt and it has translucent skin and it is wearing a black suit.

39:49.880 --> 39:57.000
And it looks at Clark Bishop in the eyes and it says, hello, subject one,

39:57.000 --> 40:02.440
five, two, two, five, one, eight, one, nine, five, five, one, eight,

40:02.680 --> 40:06.480
please hand me the book, please.

40:13.800 --> 40:43.120
How am I the only one trying to fool or how can I have enough

40:43.120 --> 40:43.840
trow?
