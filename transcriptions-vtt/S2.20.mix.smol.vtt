But the truth live on six nine four point two PT BP

03:06.400 --> 03:13.520
Except when I feel like doing a little lie every now and then but I cannot lie about how I love

03:13.680 --> 03:20.640
Seeing a new howling with wolf coming in hot fresh and fragrant I drool in

03:21.440 --> 03:23.160
anticipation I

03:23.160 --> 03:26.280
Masticate the words to make them more easily

03:27.000 --> 03:28.240
digestible

03:28.240 --> 03:29.600
something about

03:29.600 --> 03:31.000
creamy

03:31.000 --> 03:35.680
Stank this here howling with wolf is from Duncan and Winnipeg, Manitoba

03:36.320 --> 03:39.120
Canada who tweeted about the show and tagged at

03:39.760 --> 03:47.960
Pretending pod a thing you could also do if you're so inclined and then my producer will look up your city name on

03:48.800 --> 03:54.200
Wikipedia the name Winnipeg comes from the Cree and Ojibwe name

03:55.080 --> 04:00.760
Winnipea which means muddy water and muddy waters was born with the name

04:01.200 --> 04:04.880
McKinley Morgan field thanks Duncan from Winnipeg

04:05.360 --> 04:06.880

04:06.880 --> 04:08.840
Hey there wolf

04:08.840 --> 04:11.760
longtime howler first time listener

04:11.760 --> 04:17.800
Is that right hard to remember down here in this dark place where the hours pass?

04:18.320 --> 04:21.600
immeasurable made to contain a golem born of

04:22.060 --> 04:27.600
Desperation and malice and built by those who wish to contain that which they did not understand

04:28.000 --> 04:31.720
This labyrinth has lain forgotten for a century

04:32.040 --> 04:38.160
Yet the beast still lives for I hear its ancient voice in the echoes of rattling bones

04:38.760 --> 04:41.340
In the beast it hungers

04:41.920 --> 04:48.280
Shout out to Pavlo Mason and Brock for trusting me to run them through their first session of Delta green

04:49.720 --> 04:57.640
Damn Duncan sounds like you live in an eternal nightmare from which you may never come back from and that sucks

04:57.880 --> 05:02.940
But what doesn't suck is that you decided to take a break from your horrid

05:03.200 --> 05:09.780
Conditions to write a letter to little old me and for that I send you immense gratitude

05:09.800 --> 05:13.120
I hope one day you can get out of that labyrinth

05:13.120 --> 05:20.020

Supers running the show and the two went back to the empty Colorado townhome to catch some sleep

06:12.280 --> 06:14.720

08:17.800 --> 08:21.600
One is Taylor Swift and the other is blonde. The other is a blonde person

08:25.960 --> 08:28.320
I mean have I met this blonde person

08:30.680 --> 08:32.680
That's who I meant

08:38.280 --> 08:42.440
Oh my god, we sound shitty again, is this just our headphones say something funny

08:44.040 --> 08:46.040
Play Freebird

08:47.720 --> 08:50.880
It's currently mid-December as Luke said and

08:51.440 --> 08:54.920
Currently we're in the middle. I don't say it. He did I pointed at Thomas

08:54.960 --> 08:58.320
he Luke points at Tom Clark Bishop said and I

08:58.840 --> 09:00.640
Just wanted to throw out

09:00.640 --> 09:06.700
We probably just came back from a little intro to this episode about our donation pledge

09:06.820 --> 09:08.820
Which at this point in time is it?

09:09.380 --> 09:13.980
$500 already, so we're gonna match that we're already gonna be able to donate over $1,000

09:15.380 --> 09:21.260
As of mid-December this when you're listening to this episode, there will probably be a much more exciting announcement

09:21.260 --> 09:26.100
Yeah, it'll come right before this. So this is a letdown. Let's get in the episode. That's what she said

09:28.180 --> 09:32.060
Far back to remember it'll come right before this so that will be a letdown

09:37.100 --> 09:44.460
It's the demons which ones the God all the gondol demons the god old name, I think he meant goons, but he said demons

10:06.180 --> 10:10.180
Apartment above the Joe. Oh, yeah, it's the bidet gal

10:11.020 --> 10:12.020
badego

10:12.020 --> 10:16.980
The badego it told Luke earlier. I was looking at my notes and I was like, why did I write down the day gal?

10:18.980 --> 10:20.980
Spelled badego wrong

10:24.660 --> 10:26.660
So you guys are in the point

10:27.300 --> 10:30.540
B AG le BAG al that's

10:30.820 --> 10:32.820
Sounds like I

10:32.860 --> 10:40.620
Spelled that in my notes as bidet gal. So I would remember how to say it instead. I read it as badego

10:43.180 --> 10:45.180
Yeah, you should have maybe gone for an UH

10:45.860 --> 10:51.540
Deagle the deagle the deagle goal and we found we we found out our stuff get done

10:51.540 --> 10:56.900
Yeah, show on some stuff guys going twice some cops came in store stuff, which is how they do. She got you

10:56.900 --> 10:58.900
Listen to season one

10:59.500 --> 11:06.060
Which was not a mistake on our part, but in fact incisive commentary the entire time as we played cops

11:07.340 --> 11:10.460
incisors used our trench and make those

11:11.900 --> 11:15.800
Trench mouth gum disease I had in college. Let's move

11:16.540 --> 11:21.620
Yeah, what the dentist said the nobody had gotten it since 1917

11:22.500 --> 11:29.300
Stress based trench mouth. Yeah, apparently trying to do college the first time was so rough on little

11:30.240 --> 11:36.740
Pussy Zach. No, no, no, you're no no, I'm supposed to write. I'm supposed to have better self-talk than that. I

11:37.420 --> 11:39.420
Wasn't ready for college

11:39.900 --> 11:42.420
That's better. So you got a World War one disease

11:44.100 --> 11:47.460
You weren't ready for college because you were a little pussy

11:48.380 --> 11:51.260
Now that that's cleared up we can talk imagine

11:51.580 --> 11:55.820
Imagine if that Zach had been sent to World War one dead so quickly

11:57.340 --> 12:00.700
All Zach you and I would thrive in war

12:00.700 --> 12:06.060
Oh, yeah being told that I like having an exact thing that I have to do. We have to get into the

12:08.860 --> 12:10.860
It's not as bad as the last episode

12:12.660 --> 12:16.980
But the episode where it took 20 fucking minutes to get to gameplay, let's do it, let's go

12:17.020 --> 12:20.340
I'm rearing. This is gonna be fun. Let's do it. I'm Cal, Colorado and I'm rearing

12:26.500 --> 12:32.900
Adjacent bodega adjacent apartment bodega adjacent if you guys just told you through tears that

12:34.180 --> 12:41.020
Even though she had stolen the footage as she was leaving a couple of police officers not in

12:41.180 --> 12:46.980
Uniforms came out of a police car used police badges and stole the rest of the footage

12:47.580 --> 12:52.460
Including the thumb drive that she had stolen from Beck Wilder

12:52.460 --> 12:57.220
We got all that when Luke said the dang bald numbers took him. That's my bad. I've got double stone. Mm-hmm

12:58.260 --> 13:00.260
It got took took got took once

13:02.300 --> 13:06.260
Tom inks at the in the post-apocalyptic part of cloud atlas

13:11.020 --> 13:13.020
It's

13:13.380 --> 13:15.380
It's good, it's a c-plus movie

13:18.580 --> 13:23.620
I think we need to go look at the security cameras at the office. Boom

13:26.380 --> 13:30.820
In Cal sick Mercedes we all vroom to the office. This is nice

13:31.380 --> 13:36.940
Thank you. I I own I don't lease and he's like have you ever seen cloud atlas? It's my favorite movie

13:36.940 --> 13:42.980
I saw it five times in theaters. Julius is watching cloud atlas on the back of the headrest on the yeah

13:42.980 --> 13:44.980
Cuz Cal always auto plays it

13:46.060 --> 13:48.220
That's based on a real guy Joe and I know

13:52.660 --> 13:55.860
Was absolutely obsessed with a b-minus movie

13:57.780 --> 14:02.540
It's working its way through through your ranks already though, you said c-plus I think

14:03.060 --> 14:09.300
I quickly autocorrected. I don't remember it other than I saw it and I was like you speak the true true

14:10.500 --> 14:13.700
Sounded like it was about geography and I wasn't ready for it. Oh

14:14.340 --> 14:16.340
It'd be so much better

14:16.940 --> 14:18.940
Here we are

14:19.380 --> 14:25.120
Let's turn that bad boy off huh? Yeah, what's that? I mean, it sounds like the heater which is what I call my piece

14:32.980 --> 14:36.580
So is that the episode

14:41.540 --> 14:46.380
Well, here we are at the can offices, oh, yeah, so it is now

14:47.180 --> 14:52.460
3 p.m. At this point. We do not have a lot of time to get this on the evening news. We have to find this footage

14:53.740 --> 14:58.820
Let's go straight to the security office. We gotta see like if there was any like identifying Mars

14:58.820 --> 15:01.620
Maybe we could see the car that they drove. It was a police car

15:01.620 --> 15:05.660
I think she said it's gonna have like a number on it. Sounds good to me. Let's let's do that

15:05.660 --> 15:06.540
Let's review the footage

15:06.540 --> 15:14.060
So you guys head to the can security office over the marvelous floor the glass and the beautiful?

15:14.620 --> 15:17.340
Can station you walk through the halls?

15:18.220 --> 15:23.580
Confidently, there are other people here at the station. So on the way there Beck

15:23.580 --> 15:30.980
I'm gonna need a grip check for you for the attire of some of your co-workers that you're passing through the hall

15:31.020 --> 15:33.540
I pass 35 and a 49 nice

15:33.540 --> 15:40.540
So you see you start to see these flashes as these people approach and how do you like contain yourself?

15:40.540 --> 15:42.540
It's a head down looking at the feet

15:42.740 --> 15:49.260
Like like somebody who is trying to be as inconspicuous as possible and just get through this hallway to the other end

15:49.260 --> 15:51.540
And you've been through these hallways time after time

15:52.180 --> 15:59.820
in the morning and you pass through the same way you always head to the can security office and as you guys pass in you

15:59.820 --> 16:05.780
See that's on shift today is ray. It's Raymond. It's the son

16:06.500 --> 16:10.100

16:25.780 --> 16:33.020
Myriad screens on the wall in front of him with this range were made by myriad. There's a little logo and

16:34.260 --> 16:37.060
He's watching tiktoks on his phone. He's just like

16:40.900 --> 16:46.280
And you hear the tiktok voice over the top like walking with my partner in

16:47.820 --> 16:50.020
Frisco Julius walks over

16:51.020 --> 16:54.180
Julius has never really it when you call it Frisco

16:54.660 --> 17:00.300
Julius has never really liked ray ray so he goes over and he sees him screwing off and

17:00.540 --> 17:05.340
Just kind of like pushes his feet off the desk and makes his chair like swivel around school

17:07.940 --> 17:11.240
Julius Julius Julius Julius. Hey, what's up, man?

17:12.060 --> 17:18.940
We ray ray we need to see some some footage from from yesterday anything from my Lucy. What's up?

17:18.980 --> 17:23.460
No, no, just just now right? No, I would have been last night. It was like calm down everybody

17:24.380 --> 17:26.780
Wins it wins it wins it

17:26.780 --> 17:30.860
It's like it's like last night at like with with it like midnight or something

17:30.860 --> 17:33.500
I think is when we left with it was shortly after we left

17:33.580 --> 17:40.060
Where are we looking for okey all over but we're naming like the parking lot. Mostly we just came in here

17:40.060 --> 17:47.760
So what can you please just I just was wondering like maybe give me a little backup and he's like kind of spooling through

17:48.320 --> 17:52.860
It's all digital. So he's by spooling. I mean he's going backwards

17:53.760 --> 17:57.800
Hey, hey, Zach. What time was this you guys left around like midnight?

17:57.800 --> 18:02.360
So you're probably looking at like 12 15 12 30 except it was like even later

18:03.320 --> 18:08.160
Because I went to the hospital cuz you're like everything's negative 40 if you do anything else

18:08.560 --> 18:13.720
So I was like, I'll go sleep. So it's like 3 so you guys are looking at like 3 15 3 30

18:13.720 --> 18:15.720
We

18:16.600 --> 18:18.940
Left the offices like a roundup

18:20.040 --> 18:22.040
Here's you guys leaving?

18:22.200 --> 18:28.560
Okay, it would be shortly after this. Yeah, we're looking for two men and a he plays it at regular speed

18:28.560 --> 18:32.520
Can you go quickly Ray Ray? Yes, please fast fast Ray Ray

18:33.080 --> 18:35.760
Beck is gonna push him out of the way because he knows how to use this equipment

18:36.840 --> 18:42.600
Come on, man. At least let me do it. It's my only job. You do well Ray Ray Beck is the best and time is of the essence

18:42.600 --> 18:45.600
You just got to turn the knob it it sets it up to be 1.5 speed

18:45.600 --> 18:47.600
It's good. We might even want to go to at this point

18:48.960 --> 18:57.320
Okay, let's take a double and he goes to two times speed pushes it through and we see Vivica sneaking back

18:57.960 --> 19:04.800
into the city action news station after you all have left looking over her shoulder the whole way through as she

19:05.000 --> 19:10.600
Crosses into the foyer. She digs deep into her pocket. She pulls out this thumb drive

19:11.600 --> 19:18.560
And there's this determined look in her not grainy face because it's pretty decent quality

19:18.880 --> 19:21.660
This quality is amazing even five years ago

19:22.120 --> 19:26.600
She would have been grainy as fuck and then she puts the thumb drive back in her pocket

19:26.600 --> 19:33.960
It shows it in there and heads back into the editing Bay surely in your minds to delete the footage or at least take it

19:33.960 --> 19:36.540
What was my character's name when we played with?

19:36.980 --> 19:42.440
Can I say the name and don't has it has it been played already? No, it hasn't come out yet her name is

19:43.200 --> 19:48.940
What's up? What was my guy's name? He owned a security company. So you see the the security system is made

19:48.940 --> 19:55.440
We just looked it up. What's who's the security system made by Vincente boring? Yeah, so it's the security system called like

20:00.900 --> 20:05.340
Yeah, it's on there yeah, you'll have to wait to hear Luke's character who chokes every line out

20:06.980 --> 20:12.100
Oh, wow, this is the best security system in the whole city. I

20:14.740 --> 20:21.980
Actually had these people install some security in my home and both my my Peabody and three local Emmys were stolen in that time. I

20:22.820 --> 20:27.500
Ended up going with Shakira toss. Well for your home, you should go with a ring doorbell

20:30.980 --> 20:35.700
Target oh, I do have a ring doorbell found a target but for for the office, it's a fun story

20:35.740 --> 20:41.780
We actually used it to some effect earlier to see Stevie running away from my basement with her brother. That's that's right

20:41.780 --> 20:47.020
I remember on that beautiful ring doorbell crystal-clear picture every time hold on. Hold on

20:47.020 --> 20:50.320
I could see the shame on her face. That was a present from my daughter

20:50.640 --> 20:55.660
She gave me a gift receipt in case I didn't want it that gift receipt was to a store called

20:56.780 --> 21:02.860
Target, huh? That's it. That's it. It was Target. Hmm. I love shopping in Target for all my holiday needs

21:02.860 --> 21:09.040
I I got you and back such wonderful presents two individuals walk through the doors

21:09.580 --> 21:16.800
Are they revolving doors into the can station? Why not? I can't yeah, of course feels like they are the old west saloon doors

21:17.260 --> 21:19.260
one of these individuals

21:22.340 --> 21:24.340
The can piano players

21:24.340 --> 21:26.340
I

21:29.660 --> 21:36.420
Immediately slumps over two individuals walk through the front door of the can station one is tall

21:37.280 --> 21:41.740
Mousey is wearing glasses and the other one is short jacked and bald

21:41.900 --> 21:46.420
They walk forward scoping out one takes the left side one takes the right side

21:46.420 --> 21:53.180
They're looking through the windows on either side. They see the editing Bay you follow them they head into the editing Bay

21:53.500 --> 21:56.620
Ray-ray, you remember every face that's coming in out of here, don't you?

21:59.140 --> 22:04.940
We can zoom enhance zoom and enhance we zoom in enhance you can do that on boring security cameras

22:05.460 --> 22:06.660
We pull back

22:06.660 --> 22:13.060
we zoom out to see these two as they walk in once again and zoom in on their faces and

22:13.460 --> 22:15.460
Something it's weird. It's like

22:16.060 --> 22:21.380
Something that they're wearing maybe seems to be obvious skating their face

22:21.380 --> 22:26.660
It's like it's too well lit like pauperizing around their shirt paparazzi clothes

22:28.180 --> 22:33.900
Paparazzi stuffs like the anti-paparazzi shirts. Can I roll to see if Julius would like associate that with?

22:34.580 --> 22:37.860
Fuck, what is the bet? Well, who are the bad guys bad guys?

22:38.540 --> 22:45.480
Got a little girl. I don't know. Does it look like God all Corp close gottel tech gottel that some gottel tech

22:45.960 --> 22:52.280
That total does it look like any of the gottel clothing we've seen no, no, no, I mean it's not gottel tech

22:52.280 --> 22:54.280
I mean, uh, well Sharon I spent

22:54.800 --> 23:00.600
Several weeks together in the in the mid 80s and and she employed a similar device against the paparazzo

23:00.600 --> 23:03.560
I bet you wish you could turn back time, dude

23:04.400 --> 23:08.600
I'm sorry. What you know like never mind mamma Mia

23:08.600 --> 23:10.600
Oh

23:12.800 --> 23:19.780
Yes, mamma Mia Abba share was in the mamma Mia sequel

23:22.720 --> 23:26.160
Mamma Mia 2 here we go again mamma Mia 2 look who's talking now

23:28.880 --> 23:30.200
Ray Ray

23:30.200 --> 23:31.600
It's it's hard to see their faces

23:31.600 --> 23:36.680
But it's like they're wearing some sort of mask have you have you ever seen anything like this or seen them before? Oh

23:37.120 --> 23:42.560
I heard about it on the internet. I heard about what on the internet. It's kind of like clothes

23:43.480 --> 23:46.840
That okay. Yes. I mean, I'm familiar. What would you google?

23:47.560 --> 23:48.960
anti

23:48.960 --> 23:50.300
face

23:50.300 --> 23:53.140
Camera, can you zoom into the car that they arrived in?

23:54.680 --> 23:56.680
Anti face camera

23:58.200 --> 23:59.320
Shirt

23:59.320 --> 24:01.520
Go ahead and zoom into the car that they came in

24:01.520 --> 24:08.880
He whips around with the digital analog knob and shows that they head into the editing bay

24:08.880 --> 24:10.760
They're in there for a couple minutes

24:10.760 --> 24:16.840
They leave the editing bay just the two of them as they're walking out one does a classic like

24:17.400 --> 24:22.520
Flicks the thumb drive in the air off their thumb. It makes a noise. Oh

24:24.440 --> 24:25.480
And

24:25.480 --> 24:27.440
Catches it throws it back in the pocket

24:27.440 --> 24:35.340
they head back out to their police car the external camera on the building looks out and you see that this is

24:36.040 --> 24:39.180
CPD number eight three six. Oh, come on

24:43.480 --> 24:48.200
Is it TC I read the spoilers discord

24:52.280 --> 24:54.280
I should have asked you what number it was

24:56.480 --> 24:58.480
Is it a

25:01.840 --> 25:09.240
Is it a city police car or contingent police car ooh interesting question, I don't know what contingent is this is season two

25:09.240 --> 25:14.920
It's a city police car. We need to find out who that police car is registered to which which officers

25:16.240 --> 25:18.720
How do you even do that Beck can do that?

25:18.720 --> 25:23.840
I mean I can I can sort of do that but like I'm not a reporter like

25:24.040 --> 25:28.440
It seems like you guys would know more about how to like investigate things

25:28.440 --> 25:33.120
Is there another way you could figure out like a way to follow them? What's that?

25:36.120 --> 25:42.160
I know that that the the Bori security company runs almost all the security around here

25:42.160 --> 25:46.480
Maybe if we call one of the higher-ups we can get access to the buildings around us

25:46.480 --> 25:49.880
I have a couple of trusted contacts in the city police force

25:49.880 --> 25:53.600
They might be able to look these badge numbers up for me this car number

25:53.600 --> 25:53.920
Yeah

25:53.920 --> 25:57.840
I think that'd be the way to go just like see if they have like who was driving the car

25:58.000 --> 26:01.260
Just like that alone would get us on the right track sick. Yeah

26:01.260 --> 26:06.640
Let's go to the giant phone in the can offices the red phone that goes straight to the police. Yeah

26:08.600 --> 26:10.600
No, no, that's that's

26:10.800 --> 26:16.000
Too obvious my contacts in the CPD prefer me to contact them more discreetly

26:17.000 --> 26:23.960
Is it like a like a secret drop situation are we doing like by stuff yes, it's very cool. Oh shit

26:23.960 --> 26:29.160
Yeah, it's very fun. I mean, it's not so like we do talk face-to-face, but there is an elaborate and

26:29.800 --> 26:34.240
Fairly pointless system of message drops and exchanges before that process can begin

26:34.240 --> 26:40.560
Are we gonna like put an X on a window Julius is googling the Bori security company hotline?

26:42.800 --> 26:44.680
Everyone roll on

26:44.720 --> 26:46.720
Intelligence or

26:49.360 --> 26:53.200
Bureaucracy 18 on the 75 I pass an intelligence role

26:55.760 --> 26:57.760
Yeah, they're ring

26:58.720 --> 27:04.000
System I'll try to do that again at Target God I went to Target the other day

27:06.640 --> 27:10.840
Classic thing where you go in for one thing and the deals are so hot you end up just

27:11.200 --> 27:13.320
You get your whole week's worth of stuff

27:14.040 --> 27:18.840
That they have at the front. I just like one dollar two dollars three dollars five

27:19.040 --> 27:23.760
Yeah, and I know before Thanksgiving. I bought a stuffed felt turkey there

27:23.800 --> 27:27.960
I'm gonna go back to Target and try to find myself a reindeer in that little front section

27:27.960 --> 27:32.680
Do you think maybe stop by this? Maybe stop by the Starbucks that's always at the front of the target

27:32.680 --> 27:35.940
I kind of feel like everything in that front section has been felt. This is crazy

27:36.460 --> 27:42.060
You bought a stuffed turkey I bought a real strict like turkey and they're extensive grocery section Wow

27:42.660 --> 27:48.940
Yeah, that is crazy. Well, and I didn't know where I was gonna get a turkey and a ham for Christmas

27:49.140 --> 27:56.380
But at Target they have it and you should go to Target if you check on Target's website. They have recipes for holiday meals

27:57.580 --> 28:01.420
late lunch time late lunch alert and you see that

28:01.740 --> 28:06.900
Thai shitty son Raymond pulls his phone back out of his pocket and he's like

28:08.940 --> 28:11.820
Deborah over traffic hit me up for that lunch time

28:12.320 --> 28:17.140
Me and Deborah from traffic over here at City Action News are gonna head out to lunch

28:17.140 --> 28:21.740
So you guys can have at this but like whatever this feels like an everybody loves Raymond joke

28:21.740 --> 28:23.980
But I don't know enough about that show to know if it's accurate

28:28.220 --> 28:30.220
What a good show

28:30.660 --> 28:35.420
Yeah, I had a real good dog named Murphy he used to sound like he was on everybody loves Raymond

28:41.060 --> 28:48.700
I passed my intelligence. So did I yes in me three successes and when Raymond brings up the debt

28:48.700 --> 28:52.700
Oh my god. I just got that. I just understood the jerk

28:53.280 --> 28:57.080
Raymond and Deborah. Yep. This is this is me. I'm Zach. What's up?

28:57.760 --> 29:04.840
It's nuts how brands work it's like two people who are so in some way like have a relationship that sounds good

29:09.360 --> 29:16.700
As as Raymond starts talking about having lunch with Deborah from traffic at City Action News you think

29:21.040 --> 29:25.980
Julius puts his phone down realizing. I don't want to talk to the boring hotline

29:27.080 --> 29:33.620
We can just use the traffic cameras and Cal has already texted his contact. How's the weather?

29:36.680 --> 29:40.920
You immediately get a text back this is Beck gets a text it says, how's the weather?

29:49.520 --> 29:54.460
It's you don't even have to be old to make a mistake like that like hey, you don't have to be that old

29:57.080 --> 29:59.080
Oh

30:02.320 --> 30:09.520
Cal it looks like you texted me. It's it's it's fine. The weather's fine. And but I think that this was probably for fuck anyway

30:11.880 --> 30:16.120
Yes, yes, yes, he scrolls down like several bees and gets to his contact

30:17.960 --> 30:19.960
How's the weather

30:19.960 --> 30:21.960
I

30:22.880 --> 30:30.200
You do you get a text back that says stormy something's brewing we need to be at City Park at 3 15 p.m

30:30.200 --> 30:32.200
It's like three right now. Oh

30:35.440 --> 30:37.440
Shit Cal we're not gonna make it

30:37.720 --> 30:43.960
You need to drive the can van like you've never driven it before or my sweet Mercedes. Whatever we took here. I

30:43.960 --> 30:45.960
I

30:46.320 --> 30:49.920
Listen we'll take my Mercedes I get out of tickets all the time

30:51.000 --> 30:56.880
Can I search the security like for like one of the like little red lights you can put on top of a car?

30:57.960 --> 30:59.960
Yeah, go ahead and roll search

31:03.040 --> 31:08.080
That's past 47 on a 70 you find a little red topper

31:08.480 --> 31:15.660
That's got a siren on the top that's got audio and visual aids and siren

31:16.160 --> 31:18.160
Let's get it

31:19.840 --> 31:21.840
Well said

31:26.760 --> 31:32.440
On the way to the can van Julius is going to hook his phone up via bluetooth to this

31:32.680 --> 31:37.640
Oh, you guys are out. You guys are out. You're in the can van. You got this topper on top everyone

31:38.920 --> 31:41.160
That's what I meant by the can van

31:41.720 --> 31:43.720
the C class

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
C is for city Caesar can

31:51.280 --> 31:55.120
Julius slaps that on top of the car and gets in the back

31:55.440 --> 31:55.940
Yeah

31:55.940 --> 32:02.680
He wants to finish watching some of cloud atlas Cal Cal baby drivers into the the front seat and most

32:08.720 --> 32:11.920
It's amazing, yeah, I'm so well buck and why

32:23.400 --> 32:29.120
Get out of the way get out of the way get out of the way Harry the Henderson out the door

32:33.040 --> 32:35.040
Oh, you're just making that noise yeah

32:36.040 --> 32:41.680
Julius is hooked up in harmony a bluetooth to the speaker that's in the topper get out of the way

32:41.680 --> 32:44.680
Oh the bluetooth speaker. That's smart

32:44.720 --> 32:50.600
Cal is like cows eyes are wide and he's speeding down like one of the main city like thoroughfares

32:50.800 --> 32:53.960
He's laughing and he turns to you guys. It was like, where are we going again?

32:54.760 --> 32:59.040
You said the park it was it was you Cal we were following your lead. That's right. He takes a sudden

33:00.040 --> 33:02.040
And

33:03.200 --> 33:10.480
Through the gates of the city park we see etched no not etched rot in iron

33:10.480 --> 33:12.480
I

33:18.400 --> 33:20.400
Got tingles

33:25.840 --> 33:32.000
Cow cow like sheds a single tear as he passes under the gates and thinks about like the brave like proud working men of

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
the city who rot

33:35.800 --> 33:37.120
120 years ago

33:37.120 --> 33:39.040
twisted it says

33:39.040 --> 33:41.400
The city park. I

33:42.240 --> 33:48.440
Love this goddamn city rolling through you see on either side of you trees

33:48.960 --> 33:53.400
Must have been why don't laugh right away. I must have been why?

33:54.000 --> 33:59.600
That's I don't know you see trees must have been planted here must have been 30 of the fuckers

34:10.040 --> 34:14.820
Must have been purposely planted here at least a hundred two hundred years ago

34:15.240 --> 34:22.320
Massive trees lining the roads on either side as you curve and make your way through this park

34:22.320 --> 34:26.480
You see picnic tables. You see ponds you see fountains

34:26.480 --> 34:33.960
You see a little boathouse where a dock has paddle boats the happy couples and families

34:34.560 --> 34:35.840
and

34:35.840 --> 34:37.160
Rangers

34:37.160 --> 34:39.720
There's a medical NPC and there's a long

34:40.240 --> 34:45.120
Green dawn on either side past the the medical person there

34:45.120 --> 34:46.760
That's adjacent to the pond

34:46.760 --> 34:54.160
Of course and the big green lawn stretch is up in a hill sort of fashion up to the top

34:54.160 --> 35:00.640
where there is a large statue of an old military general on a horse in front of a

35:01.080 --> 35:06.680
Massive building with columns in front of it major general means major gentle means

35:07.240 --> 35:09.540
major general beans major general

35:11.240 --> 35:14.140
And you know for that guy he looks like a cop

35:17.100 --> 35:22.800
You see a police officer on a bike in front of you is that our guy no hit him

35:23.100 --> 35:25.100
Where

35:25.960 --> 35:32.980
Are you meeting your contact probably under the major general being statue where you can also access the docks to one of the

35:33.400 --> 35:35.080
myriad ponds

35:35.080 --> 35:41.680
And there's there's some like duck boats that you can paddle as you pass the police officer that's on a bicycle

35:41.680 --> 35:48.980
He gives you a kind of stink eye as you head into the the double lanes you as you pass the bicycle

35:48.980 --> 35:53.940
It's the appropriate way to pass someone on a bicycle mind you but he gets a kind of hair

35:54.380 --> 35:59.500
Tingles up on the back of his neck and then decides. I don't really want to do anything right now

36:00.100 --> 36:05.020
Cal is cows in a you know cows in an odd mood these past few days

36:05.020 --> 36:11.380
But he chuckles and he says don't worry boys. We're off to meet that those bosses boss damn Cal

36:12.260 --> 36:14.260
That's only two rings up

36:19.780 --> 36:21.780
Guys still makes coffee

36:23.140 --> 36:26.580
Julius through the speaker on the roof of the car just says oops

36:28.780 --> 36:30.500
Sorry

36:30.500 --> 36:36.420
Yeah, I didn't take into account the siren on the top of your car. Did I know that guy was an idiot

36:37.140 --> 36:43.400
Let's go meet our man. Let's go meet this man as you approach the statue at the top of this hill

36:43.760 --> 36:47.760
There's like a circle drive around it and Cal pulls the Mercedes over

36:47.960 --> 36:52.480
He kind of looks over it back in the passenger seat looks it was starting to get the camera out

36:52.600 --> 36:55.860
looks at Julius and the in the back and he says um

36:56.660 --> 37:03.880
Unfortunately, there's only room for two on the on the goose paddle boats, but could you follow discreetly behind me?

37:04.080 --> 37:08.080
Yeah, hey Cal is it cool if I mic you up very cool back

37:09.080 --> 37:13.440
Also, give me one of your tik-tok phones and I could

37:15.200 --> 37:18.800
Hide it in my pocket square and and lean towards

37:19.240 --> 37:21.240
Julius gives him his tik-tok phone

37:21.560 --> 37:27.880
And Julius is stoked because he knows that he can paddle the shit out of these boats with his fucking huge legs

37:32.080 --> 37:37.740
Discreetly but you could pull alongside us at some distance and zoom in. Oh, yeah with the audio

37:38.200 --> 37:41.280
You're mostly gonna be going in circles though from what I can hear from

37:44.400 --> 37:46.560
Julius is gonna sit in the middle and paddle both

37:49.680 --> 37:53.380
That way back can straddling like the goose's neck

38:00.200 --> 38:06.760
Hey Cal I can you know, I can splash you if you want no, no, no, don't get too close. He'll know something is up

38:06.800 --> 38:07.960
Okay, okay

38:07.960 --> 38:10.920
Should we go first that would be best if you go before us?

38:10.920 --> 38:16.280
You could we'll get a good we'll get a good spot your pace and advantage you behind that's much easier than trying to I'll get

38:16.280 --> 38:20.180
A lot of footage of like the trees and stuff. So it looks like we're just tourists making making videos

38:20.200 --> 38:23.520
They do call you the b-roll bastard. I

38:24.940 --> 38:31.000
Was hoping that was gonna catch on fuck. Yeah. Oh, did you start that back? Yeah, that's a good one. It's working

38:31.000 --> 38:34.960
It's yeah, I heard it from like I heard it from a couple people. Oh, yeah

38:35.520 --> 38:42.800
That doesn't usually work great job back as you're buying the admission tickets to hop on Julie you think about curious cow

38:44.200 --> 38:48.600
Curious cow I like it. That sounds a little weird

38:52.400 --> 38:58.480
Don't spread that one I'll think on it Julius flashes his season pass which allows a guest

38:58.480 --> 39:00.480
We

39:03.200 --> 39:06.440
Have your boat waiting for you right here, mr. Summers it

39:08.240 --> 39:13.120
It's a goose with sunglasses on and on the side it's gilded it says summers

39:21.240 --> 39:24.920
Which it I turn on to work against my legs and this is my

39:28.480 --> 39:30.480
I

39:30.920 --> 39:36.480
Let's go will you be having the regular with it today make it the VIP right away, sir

39:36.480 --> 39:38.920
and as you guys are getting on the

39:39.800 --> 39:46.800
Spectacle goose a platter arrives and is sat down in front of you. It's got a top on it. Would you do the honors Beck?

39:46.920 --> 39:54.440
Yeah, man. Do you like do this a lot as he pulls up the Julius just slaps his thighs and kind of like duh

39:59.480 --> 40:02.760
So I'm thinking it's just protein it's a

40:03.320 --> 40:07.200
Like one of those like muscle powder like shaker things

40:07.920 --> 40:12.920
And then like a charcuterie board, but it's mostly it's like two full summer sausages

40:17.760 --> 40:19.760
Plus like four ounces of vodka

40:21.800 --> 40:25.800
Like a big Slim Jim just snaps into

40:25.800 --> 40:27.800
One of the summer sausages

40:27.960 --> 40:34.620
Beck you better hold on. Yeah. Oh, yeah, and I'm kind of I'm doing what we said just kind of holding on for dear life

40:36.360 --> 40:38.360
Getting into a good angle

40:38.960 --> 40:40.960
and

40:42.520 --> 40:47.080
Julius flips the motor in reverse and starts pedaling forward quickly

40:47.080 --> 40:49.080
And

40:51.500 --> 40:55.840
You guys make your way out into the middle of this pond

40:55.960 --> 41:04.080
He's like make it like creating like a wake making you awake out to yeah, like it's like bouncing. It's bouncing the other

41:04.840 --> 41:06.840
bird

41:08.000 --> 41:12.880
All right, so the two of you are out there in the water and Cal Cal

41:13.520 --> 41:18.640
Cal is approaching his contact who is in like a classic kind of trench coat

41:18.640 --> 41:24.520
Yes, of course any any taps is he taps his lapel and it's like a back. Can you hear me?

41:24.520 --> 41:26.520
And we've got we've got our headphones

41:31.960 --> 41:37.440
Doesn't zoom just like goes to the focus of like the very obvious boat with these two with their boom

41:37.440 --> 41:41.320
I say to Julius I didn't set up a way for us to communicate with him

41:41.640 --> 41:43.640
Julius gives a big thumbs up

41:51.120 --> 41:53.460
That's funny for a minute and he turns around

41:57.800 --> 42:05.240
He gives you a big thumbs up too and approaches police chief McMillan Oh police chief McMillan who is a

42:06.040 --> 42:07.000
Broad-shouldered

42:07.000 --> 42:10.400
gentleman with a big ol walrus

42:10.980 --> 42:17.140
Mustache that is gray and salt and pepper. What's his head look like shiny? Yeah

42:17.280 --> 42:21.520
Yeah, very shiny since he's got a walrus stash. He has to be bald

42:27.000 --> 42:33.480
Haircut and a walrus mustache looks strange. Yeah, he's got he's got these crazy like schoolboy locks

42:35.600 --> 42:40.760
Like fifties, yeah, but his but his mustache is is is more gray than red

42:40.760 --> 42:44.360
But it still twitches weirdly like a walruses almost like whiskers

42:44.880 --> 42:49.660
Mr. Colorado was a pleasure back. I can see that guy sweating from over here

42:51.880 --> 42:53.880
Mac are you okay?

42:56.480 --> 43:01.060
What I don't get out on the boat, oh, yes, I definitely agree

43:01.820 --> 43:05.580
By the way, this is a two-party consent state, so I

43:07.700 --> 43:12.420
Just need to tell you this conversation is being recorded is this normal for the two of you

43:12.420 --> 43:13.540
This is abnormal

43:13.540 --> 43:15.060
but in real life

43:15.060 --> 43:20.460
It might not be abnormal if you just always guaranteed him that he was on what I think it's called deep cover or deep background

43:20.460 --> 43:23.560
That they on background on background. Is that what it is? Can't be quoted

43:24.300 --> 43:28.700
Background is but you are deep back your deep background. You can't be quoted in

43:29.100 --> 43:32.540
It like is very meaningful hello, mr. X

43:33.620 --> 43:37.340
You're on deep background. Oh, then I can use this voice

43:40.500 --> 43:42.980
It's hard easier to understand for sure, please

43:43.700 --> 43:48.220
Just for the sake of journalistic integrity. Could you please speak as clearly as possible?

43:48.420 --> 43:52.380
So there's no issue with the with the transcription. Yes, of course

43:53.120 --> 43:55.120
Thank you

43:55.840 --> 43:59.560
That was as best as I could do that was very good for me

44:09.520 --> 44:11.520
Back I think this guy's having a stroke

44:13.680 --> 44:19.360
He keeps shaking his head as he talks, I think that might be the issue sweat is just flying off of him

44:20.360 --> 44:28.160
I'm very nervous cow Mac. You're my best source. I need to know about two of your officers. He

44:29.280 --> 44:36.000
Walks, he looks at you with that big mustache. He walks off the side of the goose boat that we're battling

44:37.600 --> 44:39.600
We've got a goose but not a swan boat

44:41.480 --> 44:43.480
It's a little uglier

44:44.600 --> 44:47.200
Ours has sunglasses on so it's inconspicuous

44:49.360 --> 44:51.360
On the eyes

44:53.120 --> 44:59.680
Let's damn got always button to us that's that's what I want to know or do you do you have reason to believe and it?

44:59.680 --> 45:03.600
Seems that you do that. Some of your rank are perhaps compromised by the gaudel Corp

45:06.600 --> 45:08.600
Never come percentage about

45:19.800 --> 45:21.800
I've never

45:32.680 --> 45:34.680
Mocking you

45:36.240 --> 45:42.160
Speak clearly man, you know, I know your father got you this job, but it's time to show some spine

45:42.840 --> 45:44.840
City is in danger

45:45.360 --> 45:48.880
Persuader bureaucracy or laws is a 20 year old kid

45:56.720 --> 45:58.720
Have no fucking clue where my dice is

45:59.560 --> 46:04.800
While you're rolling Julius you receive a text from tife Rayland your uncle and it reads

46:05.760 --> 46:07.760
Need to see you in my office

46:08.520 --> 46:12.940
Bring Beck and cow. What was I rolling? You are rolling on law

46:13.540 --> 46:15.340
Bureaucracy or

46:15.340 --> 46:19.540
Persuade I win them all with a 29. I win the mice

46:20.860 --> 46:27.180
Julius doesn't respond right now. Well, you say that's just a type of the God all company is

46:28.180 --> 46:32.220
When that's where me 10 films all through the city police department

46:32.820 --> 46:37.220
And it's hard to know who you can trust anymore. Who's a real cop and who's a cop?

46:37.260 --> 46:39.940
What percentage roughly would you say are cops?

46:40.940 --> 46:42.940
Mm-hmm

46:43.260 --> 46:47.460
Unfortunately, it's hard to tell these days, but I say it's somewhere between

46:49.140 --> 46:50.740
15 and

46:50.740 --> 46:53.460
25% this thick is a poison is poison

46:53.460 --> 47:00.060
That's going like a virus not poison unless a poison cause a poison that grows maybe a

47:00.900 --> 47:02.900
poison that grows

47:03.500 --> 47:08.040
Mac you may have just given us the name of the segment that wins the next Peabody

47:08.120 --> 47:13.760
Bob what's all in the name to get it all out and make sure that the good people of the city are being taken care

47:13.760 --> 47:19.360
Of and being watched over whether it's by the funny police department or the city. I can news or whatever goes out

47:25.640 --> 47:29.240
Beck turns to Julius. I'm just getting plosives dude. It's all

47:38.040 --> 47:40.040
a

47:40.320 --> 47:42.320
Make sure you're getting the spit flying

47:47.080 --> 47:50.080
Becca zoomed in on the lips to try to better understand him

47:52.960 --> 47:54.960
I'm already there

47:59.040 --> 48:02.240
Back I can feel the water level of this pond raising just

48:09.040 --> 48:11.840
Mac that's what I'm trying to use the dire straight

48:11.840 --> 48:16.000
I have known you since you were just a beat cop and I was a beat reporter

48:16.800 --> 48:20.800
We would get drinks at suds and buds the bus sides of buds

48:20.800 --> 48:25.600
I have they were the best suds of buds could have and you were my best, but

48:26.440 --> 48:28.440
Do you remember those days Mac?

48:30.520 --> 48:32.520
Well, of course I go

48:32.520 --> 48:34.520
I

48:34.680 --> 48:40.120
It's amazing, I feel like my voice has grown deeper or more

48:41.680 --> 48:43.680
Distinguished

48:45.360 --> 48:50.800
Except for the gray in your beard Mac. I'd swear you had an age today

48:56.800 --> 48:59.440
Julius is giving back the craziest look

49:00.440 --> 49:02.440
He's returning it

49:03.840 --> 49:07.560
My father was a Mac his father was a Mac his father father

49:08.680 --> 49:11.560
I'm a Mac. Oh, this is where we see he has like

49:12.200 --> 49:14.200
Fishman gills

49:15.360 --> 49:20.220
Okay, I'm laughing too hard. Yeah, this is nuts. Let's get to the let's get to the point here

49:20.220 --> 49:24.840
I mean you just keep doing it for a little bit. Well, I don't remember what that is

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
You can break that what to do

49:29.440 --> 49:31.440
Hold on

49:42.120 --> 49:47.760
You're right Mac we should get to the point I pass him like a little sheet of paper that has the the

49:48.320 --> 49:56.400
CPD 836 license plate on it and I say two of your officers were spotted entering the can offices last night and

49:56.840 --> 49:59.480
Leaving with the biggest story of my career

49:59.480 --> 50:03.400
I was hoping you could tell me who they were and where they might have gone

50:03.680 --> 50:07.640
But I do think there are certainly one of those 15% that are

50:08.040 --> 50:10.240
Gops, not cops role

50:10.880 --> 50:12.880
law or bureaucracy

50:13.920 --> 50:16.540
17 big ol pass yo

50:17.880 --> 50:22.780
He's like basic platelet and he pulls out his phone cop that

50:26.840 --> 50:29.580
What is your query I am

50:31.480 --> 50:35.840
6c PD 8 3 6 8 2 6

50:46.320 --> 50:51.600
Hold up two fingers to Thomas like okay, there's two people

50:51.600 --> 50:53.600
It's

50:54.240 --> 50:56.240
826 say 3 6

50:57.880 --> 51:05.840
CPD 8 3 6 2 officers assigned to vehicle officers Richard Riley and

51:06.520 --> 51:08.920
Wilson Wiley, well, why do you have it?

51:08.920 --> 51:14.520
Which are violent and was compiled they show officers. What did they do? They stole the biggest news story since 9-eleven

51:15.360 --> 51:16.760
Whoa

51:16.760 --> 51:22.040
What do Karen to go into any details place? Tell me anything that won't get me into too much trouble

51:22.040 --> 51:25.200
I yearn to learn you should have been a journalist my friend

51:25.200 --> 51:28.080
I tried to get you to go into J school when we were roommates

51:30.080 --> 51:32.080
Like it was yesterday

51:32.120 --> 51:35.320
See me those dawn looking over a single tear trust

51:36.160 --> 51:40.320
Cal's face. I know exactly what you mean Julius is once

51:41.040 --> 51:43.040
once again looking it back like

51:43.720 --> 51:45.720
You know what

51:45.960 --> 51:48.040
We've got a boom hour like organically

51:49.920 --> 51:55.800
If he's like vaguely, uh, like a nautical creature, right? He's a walrus in my head

51:57.960 --> 52:04.440
Mac I can't thank you enough for this information. I know I did with some give me a little tease, baby. Oh

52:04.440 --> 52:06.440
Oh

52:12.280 --> 52:16.320
Mac you know, I can't do that. Hey, also, maybe next time just text me

52:25.560 --> 52:28.040
I'll get a burner. It'll be easier

52:28.840 --> 52:35.720
But you know these swan boats tire out my legs I you look down and he's just got calves for dogs

52:35.920 --> 52:41.440
He's got the calves that like Julius Summers wishes he had with his thighs. Oh, yeah

52:42.520 --> 52:44.620
We have just been going around in circles

52:47.360 --> 52:49.360
The can boat circles

52:51.360 --> 52:55.400
While Julius is like looking at back just dumbfounded

52:55.400 --> 53:02.240
He is kind of not paying enough attention and goes right by them like a foot away

53:02.640 --> 53:04.640
What is the back to shore?

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Cal just like glares at you

53:08.040 --> 53:10.040
Like Tanya and Porsche

53:10.240 --> 53:12.240
My Tanya Porsche

53:13.120 --> 53:15.120
reference

53:15.200 --> 53:18.720
I did think it would be funny. No right now. Well, yeah

53:18.720 --> 53:21.360
Also kind of people will be catching up then over the holidays

53:21.400 --> 53:26.280
And I thought it would be funny if we like just tease Joe about the things he hasn't seen watch it

53:26.280 --> 53:28.280
I don't think that'd be funny

53:31.200 --> 53:34.760
You guys parked the swan back at the dock and

53:35.600 --> 53:42.240
Hop on out and he immediately goes to the person who's working there that the young person behind the counter

53:42.240 --> 53:44.240
Thank you so much for an excellent

53:46.040 --> 53:47.600
And heads up

53:47.600 --> 53:54.600
For a what experience max on excellent got it Cal didn't catch that but he does tip the kid like 80 bucks

53:59.800 --> 54:05.760
Julius finishes up his summer sausages and hops onto the deck and

54:06.280 --> 54:11.320
Is just like stoked at what he just experienced but also very confused

54:11.360 --> 54:18.120
Yeah, Cal Cal is waving goodbye to Mac as he gets like he walks back to the parking lot and he he turns around and

54:18.200 --> 54:20.940
Runs up to you guys and is like well you heard the man

54:28.360 --> 54:30.360
Yeah about that Cal

54:31.360 --> 54:37.620
What the way he talked like is he like is that just like a thing with him Beck?

54:37.620 --> 54:38.940
I don't know what you're on about

54:38.940 --> 54:45.260
You know what sometimes I tell you hey watch those peas and I say the word plosives like he had a lot of the plosives

54:45.260 --> 54:47.260
dude plosives plosives

54:48.380 --> 54:50.380
Plosives that is a fun word

54:51.180 --> 54:56.100
No, I don't know what it means. It's just the audio wasn't great, but I think we got most of it

54:57.820 --> 55:03.620
Okay, I mean I you know, that's really your department back so that's a little disappointing to hear

55:03.820 --> 55:09.420
Did you remember what the names the cop net said Richard Riley Wilson Wiley

55:09.820 --> 55:12.340
Julius is gonna start googling those names. Oh

55:13.940 --> 55:19.960
You're gonna be able to find some social media pages some would cops have LinkedIn

55:21.140 --> 55:23.540
No cops have problematic Facebook's

55:24.740 --> 55:32.160
Like no Instagram like no look at the groups. They're in so Julius is Julius finds a blue lives matter

55:32.760 --> 55:38.120
Banner yep sticker thing with a frame. That is the Punisher. Yes

55:39.560 --> 55:46.360
50 Wilson Wiley's yeah, but most of them are like, okay a third of them are the same like happy dad

55:46.360 --> 55:49.880
He's like recreated all the photos like all the profiles

55:51.660 --> 55:53.660
Every time we forgot his login

55:55.600 --> 55:57.600
And then there's that one

55:57.640 --> 56:04.000
Yeah, you scroll down through a bunch and you get to the the Punisher and the the blue lives matter Julius knows that this

56:04.000 --> 56:09.540
Is who he's looking for? Oh, man, look look who's there in his featured photos. It's Richard Riley

56:09.540 --> 56:13.220
Do they look like the guys I saw on the security ad so

56:13.740 --> 56:19.280
Lutely and the the one that is tall mousy and wears glasses is

56:20.460 --> 56:24.620
Wilson that is right. It's Wilson Wiley and the short jacked and bald one

56:24.940 --> 56:31.500
That's Richard Riley Richard Riley shout out to Cameron from Kansas City for

56:32.360 --> 56:39.340
Wilson Wiley one of our $10 patreon patrons. Hold on. Hold on Kansas City, Kansas or Kansas City, Missouri

56:39.340 --> 56:41.940
It just says Cameron from Kansas City

56:42.900 --> 56:46.740
Well, then I guess we'll see Cameron one has to assume, Missouri

56:46.740 --> 56:48.740
You

56:56.100 --> 56:58.100
Now a target

56:59.540 --> 57:05.220
You guys are standing in the middle of City Park we were looking at the Facebook you were looking through the Facebook

57:05.220 --> 57:12.460
I want to see if he's posted his like posted a status like with his his location accidentally on that's it

57:12.460 --> 57:19.940
Just says an address of like maybe a house. He lives in interesting or like his militia meetup. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead and real search

57:22.320 --> 57:28.460
57 on a 70. Yeah, absolutely one of the most recent photos that has been snapped is

57:28.980 --> 57:36.260
Actually of him and of Wilson it is of both Richard and Wilson together peeking behind a fence over a fence

57:38.180 --> 57:40.180
They are peeking over a fence

57:40.580 --> 57:43.800
It does have the geotech locked on there

57:51.100 --> 57:57.780
And it is a location that is in the city in the warehouse district look nice

58:00.460 --> 58:05.580
Dude does one of you live in the browser that seems like a cool place Julius might live

58:05.740 --> 58:12.340
He is renting a house in the center place, of course, we know what kind of neighborhood the warehouse district is. Oh, yeah

58:12.340 --> 58:14.340
Yeah, it's actually it's down by

58:14.740 --> 58:17.780
It's down by the docks. It's like the warehouse district

58:18.300 --> 58:23.660
Which is like specifically that's yes, but is it cool or is it not it depends on who you are

58:23.660 --> 58:27.460
I suppose for someone like you it might not be cool for someone who is

58:27.900 --> 58:34.860
Maybe Beck speed but ten years speedier might be cool. I mean younger or older

58:34.860 --> 58:39.060
I think it means young it's cool. Yeah, it could be cool. It's up-and-coming cool

58:39.060 --> 58:44.340
I mean clearly these guys aren't hanging out at a cool place guys. I I I think I went to a

58:44.940 --> 58:48.220
Show in a warehouse around this area in college

58:49.060 --> 58:51.060
Which was not that long ago

58:51.060 --> 58:53.060
I

58:55.660 --> 58:57.660
Been doing like a bar

59:03.540 --> 59:06.700
Wait, seriously, you two are you want to go to the warehouse district?

59:06.700 --> 59:12.340
I mean, that's it's where the guys are. I did a lot of reporting in the warehouse district in the 80s

59:12.340 --> 59:19.220
It's it's actually a kind of a up-and-coming spot. There's a restaurant there called the black widow

59:20.220 --> 59:22.220
Interesting, it's all eggs

59:22.980 --> 59:26.900
Spider egg shaped foods. It's where a cool young person might live

59:26.900 --> 59:32.740
It's kind of like two blocks where you would actually live and then the rest is, you know less up-and-coming

59:33.260 --> 59:37.180
Exciting but this is definitely right off one block over from where it's cool

59:37.260 --> 59:44.100
Well, let's let's go check it out. Joy is to get another text. This just says ETA. Oh fuck guys. I forgot

59:44.100 --> 59:46.100

59:47.020 --> 59:53.220
My uncle texted us while we were filming that and he wants us to come in but yeah, I mean like I

59:53.860 --> 59:59.140
Don't know. We can't like disobey our boss, but I can't show my face in there without that footage

59:59.340 --> 01:00:03.780
We've got to show it tonight Julius. I think you're right. We've got to go find the footage

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:09.980
Can you like hold off your uncle tell him we're pursuing a lead and we'll be there in an hour and a half. I

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.740

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:17.300
Picture that I took while we were on the boat and I'm gonna say get in a workout in

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:27.060
Our 1.5 HR question mark and send that to off to oh, oh Julius

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:33.180
He's gonna think you're not applying yourself. He knows about my my routine. We talked about it before I got hired

01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:37.580
Like he's like listen if you want to be on TV

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:42.060
You're gonna have to give a little Hemsworth

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:51.180
My worth is good. My worth my worth is my legs. Your Hemsworth is Hemsworth

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.640
So Julius, that's your cock and your pecs

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:05.540
Julius sends that text off worriedly and let's get there really fast

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.540
We

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:12.700
Which is what Julius is saying into the phone

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:19.540
Yeah, he's holding like a Bluetooth speaker no, it's the topper has one in it

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:25.820

01:04:58.660 --> 01:04:59.900
It's not bumping

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:06.540
there's an empty patio and you can see like through the windows from the outside that the place is

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:13.560
Empty and there's a massive truck sitting all by itself in the parking lot nuts for days

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:18.580
For sure, and it's got a big bumper sticker on the back that says in God

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:22.980
Oh, we trust my god. What happened to this place. This used to be Gintim and cellar

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:29.360
The finest wine bar in the city and now it's what is it called? Well

By the cattle family becoming shallower and shallower
