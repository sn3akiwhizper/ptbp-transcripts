00:00.000 --> 00:07.920
Hello, my talk show audience. It's your host with the most advice, Dr. Wolf the dog.

00:07.920 --> 00:16.080
I always believe in quantity over quality when it comes to talking people through their complex problems.

00:16.080 --> 00:23.040
The more words I say, the more likely you are to believe I know what the hell I'm even talking about.

00:23.040 --> 00:30.400
And I am chatting at you live from 694.2 PTBP as always.

00:30.400 --> 00:35.120
But not as always. We got a different type of episode today.

00:35.120 --> 00:41.520
Well, them boys from pretending to be people ain't seen each other in person in so long.

00:41.520 --> 00:44.560
But today I got a real sweet treat for y'all.

00:44.560 --> 00:50.400
Those five fine fellas use the internet to have a remote conversation with each other.

00:50.400 --> 00:56.080
During this talk, they attempted to answer every single question sent in from y'all.

00:56.080 --> 01:00.240
Our beautiful and charismatic listeners.

01:00.240 --> 01:03.840
I only have remote conversations with everyone.

01:03.840 --> 01:08.080
So I don't know what the big hubbub is over all this stuff.

01:08.080 --> 01:13.760
My voice reaches beyond the stars into other dimensions unknown.

01:13.760 --> 01:18.720
I ain't never had to shake no hands to get my point across.

01:18.720 --> 01:22.480
But I digress. So I can digest.

01:22.480 --> 01:30.640
We here at 694.2 PTBP are proud to present another Q&A for our next episode.

01:30.640 --> 01:33.840
Episode 74 if you're keeping track.

01:33.840 --> 01:41.840
However, this next one will be less focused on the players and more focused on the story and characters.

01:41.840 --> 01:46.960
Wolf knows the expanse of the webs in place from contention to the city,

01:46.960 --> 01:50.880
from the future to the past and all times in between.

01:50.880 --> 01:58.880
Our dear cops are merely cogs wrapped up in something so, so, so much bigger than themselves.

01:58.880 --> 02:06.400
Let's try to take a more objective look at what has unfolded here on 694.2 PTBP

02:06.400 --> 02:11.920
as we head into the final few fables of this, the story of contention.

02:12.720 --> 02:19.280
So head on over to the subreddit at reddit.com slash r slash pretending to be people

02:19.280 --> 02:23.280
and find that Q&A thread to submit your questions.

02:23.280 --> 02:26.560
Understanding the nature of this being a closed game,

02:26.560 --> 02:30.240
we are going to shy away from secrets between players

02:30.240 --> 02:35.680
and focus more on details that have been glossed over or just plain forgotten.

02:35.680 --> 02:40.240
I'm not saying this puzzle doesn't currently have plenty of missing pieces,

02:40.240 --> 02:46.160
just that some of them were forgotten under the table and dragged away by an inquisitive kitty.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.120
Or time.

02:47.120 --> 02:52.960
Or it's just thick fluffy clouds of that good good that are merely fogging some memories.

02:52.960 --> 02:58.720
Either way, now's a good time to get loose, shake it out, maybe do some light stretching

02:58.720 --> 03:02.560
because this next tune, it'll give you the Pringles Tingles.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.480
You will pop.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.400
You will not stop.

03:06.400 --> 03:14.400
Stop me if you've heard this one before, but don't because it is kudzu with no back.

03:15.440 --> 03:28.400
Boom.

03:32.560 --> 03:47.040
Hi, Zach.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.040
What's up, everybody?

03:49.040 --> 03:49.520
What up?

03:49.520 --> 03:49.840
Hello.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.480
I'm in my home and I'm wearing sweatpants.

03:54.080 --> 03:54.720
That's gross.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.400
I'm in my home and I'm wearing jorts.

03:57.440 --> 03:58.560
Ooh, I like that.

03:58.640 --> 04:02.080
And half in for the majority of this ordeal.

04:02.880 --> 04:04.480
Jorts has been the go-to.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.320
Yeah, too hot for sweatpants.

04:07.040 --> 04:11.040
I keep going back and forth between joggers and corduroy short shorts.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.680
Ooh, short shorts.

04:13.680 --> 04:14.560
Short shorts.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.080
How short are these short shorts?

04:16.080 --> 04:17.920
Five inch inseam, baby.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.040
I don't know what that means, but it sounds tight.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.240
It sounds uncomfortable.

04:26.240 --> 04:30.000
It's really nice because you get a breeze.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.560
Oh, under your dong.

04:33.440 --> 04:33.680
Yeah.

04:34.480 --> 04:34.800
Nice.

04:37.920 --> 04:38.480
Yeah, dude.

04:39.120 --> 04:39.440
Yeah.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.160
This is weird breeze.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.200
The recording over the...

04:44.080 --> 04:45.520
I can see all of you.

04:45.520 --> 04:46.240
Windy Wang.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.800
I don't have to side-eye any of you anymore.

04:50.800 --> 04:54.000
I can see you all in one place without really moving my eyes at all.

04:54.960 --> 04:55.440
Stop moving your eyes.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.720
I'm just doing it out of habit.

05:01.280 --> 05:08.720
So today we are taking this experimental trip into remote recording to record a Q&A.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.000
Luke just sent a chat to the group in Zoom.

05:14.000 --> 05:14.560
It says,

05:17.680 --> 05:22.720
My friends, I've missed you terribly over the past few weeks.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.120
It's honestly, I can't read the rest of it because it's going to make me cry.

05:27.120 --> 05:27.920
It doesn't say pee.

05:32.640 --> 05:33.680
Just kidding, it's Luke.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.160
It says pee.

05:37.280 --> 05:40.000
I'm not eloquent enough to write anything more than that.

05:40.000 --> 05:40.800
I knew what you meant.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.920
Yeah, we all remember the vibe.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.560
Hey, this is the wrong time to do it, but I'm going to grab a glass of water and a weed cookie.

05:50.560 --> 05:51.120
All right, bye.

05:51.120 --> 05:51.620
Bye.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.760
And this is the Thomas List Q&A.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.840
He just like doesn't come back for the rest of the time.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.560
He never said he was coming back.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.040
He just said he was going to go grab that stuff.

06:03.040 --> 06:03.920
You know where he's going.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.880
He's going to go sit on his porch.

06:09.440 --> 06:09.760
And talk to his dog.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.040
It's a nice porch to sit on upon.

06:15.040 --> 06:15.440
What else?

06:15.440 --> 06:18.480
Oh, I hope Murphy talks at least once or twice.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.320
Oh, he might.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.840
Thomas is set up in the kitchen.

06:21.840 --> 06:29.040
I can see that because his life-size Ozzy Smith poster is right behind him.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.000
The one that Zach has an intimate relations with.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.520
Oh, look, Thomas is back.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.360
Oh, my God.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.400
Oh, God damn it, Luke.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.880
Luke has the ability to screen share, which is nice.

06:40.880 --> 06:41.600
Yeah, that's good.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.400
I just typed in weed guy and that came up.

06:44.960 --> 06:45.840
It's great.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.960
His fingernails are bad and hurt me to look at.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.120
He's pretty gross.

06:52.720 --> 06:53.920
I'll stop sharing that.

06:53.920 --> 06:54.160
Sorry.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.160
Thanks, dude.

06:56.160 --> 06:56.560
Thank you.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.240
There's definitely won't be the last one though.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.120
Yeah, I still miss you guys.

07:03.920 --> 07:04.480
I do too.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.520
Yeah, I get misty in my downs.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.480
You guys have been watching.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.680
You guys have been watching anything to pass the time.

07:15.680 --> 07:16.400
All the things.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.880
Obviously, Tiger King.

07:18.880 --> 07:19.200
Yeah.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.120
Dude, I just finished it.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.880
I know everyone's talking about it.

07:22.880 --> 07:24.800
It's so crazy.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.600
Yeah, if you haven't watched it yet, you should watch it.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.320
Boy, howdy.

07:29.040 --> 07:35.840
It is so bizarre in a way that I was not even prepared for already knowing how bizarre it was.

07:35.840 --> 07:41.840
Dude, I could not help but laugh out loud when they were showing the pizza that they made at the zoo.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.160
Oh, no.

07:44.640 --> 07:45.140
Yeah.

07:46.080 --> 07:49.920
Imagine if you'd been there and you saw that and you had eaten one of those pizzas.

07:49.920 --> 07:50.160
Right.

07:53.520 --> 07:57.840
So I saw somebody on Facebook was posting about it and one of the comments was like,

07:57.840 --> 08:00.240
dude, you know I got married there, right?

08:00.960 --> 08:06.640
And then he posted a picture and said, Carol Baskins was our officiant.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.160
And it was a picture of them getting married.

08:08.160 --> 08:08.320
No way.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.360
Carol Baskins with the flower crown marrying them.

08:11.920 --> 08:12.880
Yeah, it was wild.

08:12.880 --> 08:16.320
Oh, Chip, I really wish I'd been here for the start of this conversation because

08:17.200 --> 08:18.720
I don't know about you guys personally,

08:21.200 --> 08:25.520
but y'all are fucking wrong about Tiger King and Carol Baskins.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.480
She's the only good one in the whole fucking documentary.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.320
She killed her husband to save those tigers.

08:32.080 --> 08:36.400
And the hero worship of Joe Exotic is really disturbing to me.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.880
Wait, is there hero worship of him?

08:38.880 --> 08:40.160
Oh, yeah, dude.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.920
I agree that that's disturbing to me too.

08:42.320 --> 08:42.960
He's a shithead.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.240
He's a horrible person.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.360
He's a terrible, terrible person.

08:45.360 --> 08:48.320
Watching that fucking wedding scene, I was like,

08:48.320 --> 08:51.840
dude, Danny McBride's whole career was just invalidated by

08:52.720 --> 08:57.120
the most insane piece of nonfiction I've ever seen.

08:57.680 --> 08:59.840
Are the wedding or the funeral?

08:59.840 --> 09:01.360
Sorry, the funeral where he's seen.

09:01.360 --> 09:05.040
He's talking about the kid's balls right in front of his mom,

09:05.040 --> 09:07.760
who was just clearly on so much fucking meth.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.200
Yeah.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.600
Then the wedding immediately afterwards,

09:11.600 --> 09:14.000
where she was one of two people he invited

09:14.000 --> 09:18.080
just so he could post on social media that she was there two months after he died.

09:18.080 --> 09:18.560
Oh, boy.

09:18.560 --> 09:19.920
Yeah, fuck that guy.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.800
I wonder how long until Carol Baskin is in jail.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.200
I think she rubbed him down pretty good and that's sardine oil.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.080
I think the evidence is gone.

09:30.720 --> 09:34.320
Well, guys, we have a crazy amount of questions to get through.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.080
I don't want to do any of these guys.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.280
Let's talk about Tiger King.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.360
This is a Tiger King spoiler cast now.

09:39.360 --> 09:39.860
Exactly.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.600
We're talking Tyg.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.080
Let's do episode by episode.

09:44.080 --> 09:47.280
Honestly, if you can have it spoiled for you by now,

09:47.280 --> 09:51.440
that clearly means that you are not social distancing, you're not staying at home.

09:53.440 --> 09:58.240
Do you like, you've done bad and you deserve to have it spoiled

09:58.240 --> 09:59.680
if you haven't seen it at this point.

09:59.680 --> 10:04.480
Our first question comes from crush36 over on the subreddit.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.800
I think it's K. Ruse36.

10:06.800 --> 10:07.760
It's crush.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.280
K. Cruz.

10:10.080 --> 10:10.720
It's Cruz.

10:10.720 --> 10:14.080
Crux36 is the mod.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.680
He's a dude who started listening a while ago.

10:17.680 --> 10:23.120
He lives on the other side of the country and he is kicking ass modding the subreddit

10:23.120 --> 10:26.880
as well as co-modding the discord for pretending to be people.

10:26.880 --> 10:27.680
Very fun.

10:27.680 --> 10:33.520
Someone changed his name to crush316 in the Google doc.

10:34.480 --> 10:43.920
So crush asks, who would win in a round robin style and championship match thumb wrestling

10:43.920 --> 10:49.280
game you do right after reading this question and then immediately commented, oh fuck, never

10:49.280 --> 10:50.320
mind coronavirus.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.440
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

10:52.640 --> 10:55.440
Yeah, we can't do it live, but that's an easy one.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.160
Obviously me.

10:56.720 --> 10:56.880
Yeah.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.400
I was going to say Thomas.

10:58.400 --> 10:58.560
Yeah.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.640
I've seen Thomas's thumbs and they frightened me.

11:00.640 --> 11:02.560
I think I would give you guys a run for the money.

11:02.560 --> 11:05.040
I've got tall thumbs and they're double jointed.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.800
I can pop it.

11:06.800 --> 11:11.200
I've got, I've got kind of short, but like stout boys.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.600
I think, I think we'd be an interesting fight, Joe.

11:13.600 --> 11:14.320
Yeah, for sure.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.720
I think Thomas would play a little dirty though.

11:16.720 --> 11:17.200
I would.

11:17.200 --> 11:21.920
I'd, uh, throw some, oh, I was going to say throw some tickles in.

11:22.800 --> 11:23.300
Okay.

11:23.600 --> 11:29.440
The tenacity of Thomas would really pull through, uh, moving, moving right along.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.280
We got that one answered pretty quickly.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.080
Joe, give up.

11:32.560 --> 11:39.600
Uh, so, uh, Jayhawk asks, let's say your character gets a do over.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.640
What one thing would you change?

11:43.280 --> 11:45.520
And then in parentheses row, you can answer twice.

11:45.520 --> 11:49.520
If for some reason the player and the character would want to change different things.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.520
Bonus points of the GM can give an idea.

11:51.520 --> 11:54.080
The GM just say Zach, come on, man.

11:54.080 --> 12:01.200
Uh, if the GM can get an idea, if the Zach, uh, can give an idea of how things would be

12:01.200 --> 12:04.000
different from that point forward, which I acknowledge could be difficult for the sake

12:04.000 --> 12:05.600
of avoiding campaign spoilers or whatever.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.560
That makes sense.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.960
Let's start with, I've got an answer.

12:08.960 --> 12:14.320
Um, I saw this question earlier today and I realized like I had no, I hadn't ever even

12:14.320 --> 12:21.280
thought of that and I felt a little disappointed because people like go so in depth and do

12:21.280 --> 12:25.440
their notes and shit and we just kind of play it once a week.

12:26.080 --> 12:26.800
So I don't know.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.240
I have no idea what I would change.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.720
I'd have to really like what Thomas would change.

12:30.800 --> 12:31.680
I don't think anything.

12:31.680 --> 12:34.960
Cause that's kind of like antithetical to the, to play in the game.

12:34.960 --> 12:40.720
But John Lee Pettymore, uh, would definitely just have fucking booked it with his $5 million

12:40.720 --> 12:44.160
in Coke money and left town, left the state.

12:44.160 --> 12:45.440
He'd be on a beach somewhere.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.720
Like that's good.

12:48.720 --> 12:49.120
Yeah.

12:49.120 --> 12:49.600
Yeah.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.520
That's, that's what he would have done differently.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.440
How long would you have been on that beach though?

12:53.440 --> 12:58.800
Before you realized maybe you weren't on a beach all along and you've been trapped.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.200
I don't know.

13:00.240 --> 13:01.280
He wouldn't fucking care.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.880
How long have we been cops in contention?

13:05.600 --> 13:12.000
Like four days, five days, December 1st to December 6th.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.800
And then back again, who's up next?

13:14.800 --> 13:15.920
I got one.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.200
I have to talk about it cryptically because the other guys don't know about this.

13:19.200 --> 13:24.240
But in this very last arc, I would have gone to a different place when I, when it was,

13:24.240 --> 13:27.760
when it was brought up both Joe and Clark, I think, think that.

13:27.760 --> 13:30.320
Oh, not this, not comp camp.

13:30.320 --> 13:30.560
Sorry.

13:30.560 --> 13:30.720
Yeah.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.440
Not comp comfy.

13:31.440 --> 13:35.840
The one, the one at the, uh, the university, there was an opportunity for Clark to maybe

13:35.840 --> 13:37.440
go to city state university.

13:38.080 --> 13:38.720
Yeah.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.960
Go hit Luke.

13:40.960 --> 13:41.600
His name's Luke.

13:42.480 --> 13:42.720
No.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.080
Does anyone remember their mascot?

13:47.760 --> 13:52.320
Was the miners won it, or we, he was a flower to the mascot.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.280
Oh, that was high school.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.320
That was the contention.

13:54.320 --> 13:55.440
High school is the miners.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.280
Oh, was that, was it a poinsettias?

13:57.280 --> 13:57.600
Yeah.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.600
No, it was the, uh, the other ones, right?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.200
It was the, uh, Edie guys.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.080
Venus flytraps?

14:02.080 --> 14:02.880
Venus flytraps?

14:02.880 --> 14:03.600
Perhaps.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.320
The Edie guys.

14:04.320 --> 14:04.800
Doesn't matter.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.320
Feed me Seymour.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.240
I call my dick the Venus flytrap.

14:11.120 --> 14:11.600
Wow.

14:12.880 --> 14:13.200
Why?

14:14.800 --> 14:19.360
Because it's Chris and Vanny and green for some reason.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.640
Green and it eats flies.

14:23.360 --> 14:27.280
I think if, if Keith was going to change anything, he would have really milked the

14:27.280 --> 14:32.240
wheelchair aspect of it more, um, after he got shot in the foot.

14:32.800 --> 14:33.600
Yeah.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.520
Gone full Ray Gillette.

14:35.520 --> 14:35.840
Yeah.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.320
I would have, uh, I don't remember.

14:38.320 --> 14:43.440
I think I got like a drone or something instead of a, like a military wheelchair.

14:43.440 --> 14:44.720
I would have changed that.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.280
The drone worked really well for me, man.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.000
You should have got one.

14:49.120 --> 14:53.120
I don't remember what my thing was, but yeah.

14:53.120 --> 14:53.360
Yeah.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.120
That didn't work out too well for you.

14:56.080 --> 15:01.520
If anybody listening, uh, wants to send us all in quarantine drones and 3d

15:01.520 --> 15:09.200
printers, that would, I would have a lot more fun if I could fuck around with both

15:09.200 --> 15:09.760
those things.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.600
I've followed subreddits for both of them for years.

15:14.400 --> 15:15.200
Oh, wow.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.040
Wait, how much do you know about dude?

15:19.040 --> 15:20.720
Not as much as I know about 3d printers.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.480
What would you print first?

15:24.480 --> 15:27.760
That's my, well, you've got to, you've got to print benchy, which is the little,

15:27.760 --> 15:32.000
uh, it's this little boat model, this adorable little boat that you print to

15:32.000 --> 15:36.400
like, and it it's for troubleshooting like your initial setup and it's really

15:36.400 --> 15:40.000
easy to tell based like it puts it through all the paces, does a bunch of

15:40.000 --> 15:42.800
different things and you can tell really easily what needs to be fixed.

15:42.800 --> 15:47.680
You do know a lot about 3d printing and people print giant benches and shit all

15:47.680 --> 15:47.920
the time.

15:47.920 --> 15:48.240
It's fun.

15:49.120 --> 15:52.880
Here's a benchy that didn't get printed for the audio format.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.160
No more screen sharing.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.040
Boom.

15:55.040 --> 15:58.000
There you can see some fucked up benches too.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
So you can see some good benches here.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.480
Yeah.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.760
3d printing's dope.

16:01.760 --> 16:05.040
What if your 3d printer has thalassophobia?

16:05.040 --> 16:05.680
What is that?

16:05.680 --> 16:08.400
The fear of like the ocean loss.

16:11.360 --> 16:15.360
Anyway, thank you for what would you change about howling with Wolf?

16:16.080 --> 16:16.480
Yeah.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.080
Would Wolf the dog change anything?

16:18.080 --> 16:20.240
I think he's perfect the way he is.

16:20.240 --> 16:24.720
And I think he thinks he's perfect the way he is.

16:24.720 --> 16:25.920
I agree.

16:25.920 --> 16:26.160
Yeah.

16:26.160 --> 16:26.400
Yeah.

16:26.400 --> 16:26.880
I don't know.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.440
There's there's not much to change about perfection, baby.

16:32.560 --> 16:32.880
All right.

16:32.880 --> 16:33.040
Yeah.

16:33.040 --> 16:36.800
I'm going to say the opposite because if I could change anything about

16:44.320 --> 16:46.800
would have canceled him after the first episode.

16:47.280 --> 16:55.280
No, like as a GM, I constantly look at things and I'm like, Oh, I could have done that better.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.960
But that's just like how you grow.

16:56.960 --> 17:01.600
And like, as the person who actually like is the only one who knows what's going on.

17:02.560 --> 17:09.600
Sometimes, you know, it's like a, it's, it's always like a thought in my mind of like,

17:09.600 --> 17:10.480
Oh, I could have changed that.

17:10.480 --> 17:16.000
Oh, I could have changed that to do the finish of like, what would change in the campaign

17:16.000 --> 17:18.080
if you guys had done the things that you had changed.

17:18.080 --> 17:23.440
Thomas, if you would have left with the money, I definitely would have had someone stop you,

17:23.440 --> 17:24.320
obviously.

17:24.320 --> 17:27.120
And perhaps imprison you likely.

17:27.120 --> 17:27.600
Oh yeah.

17:27.600 --> 17:30.320
I know that's not a, that's not like a real viable option.

17:30.320 --> 17:33.440
That's just what Don Lee anymore would try to do.

17:33.440 --> 17:33.680
Yeah.

17:33.680 --> 17:40.000
And then they would have had to like, uh, you know, uh, come and capture or not capture.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.440
What's the opposite of capturing someone?

17:41.440 --> 17:45.040
What's Mario trying to do for save rescue.

17:46.240 --> 17:46.560
Bounce.

17:48.720 --> 17:55.760
So any of those things, uh, to you, uh, Joe, if you would have gone to a different location,

17:56.640 --> 17:59.760
uh, then yes, a lot would have changed.

17:59.760 --> 18:02.880
The last arc might not have happened the way it happened.

18:02.880 --> 18:08.960
And, uh, I, I actually had completely other plans that I decided to change.

18:08.960 --> 18:15.840
Uh, so that, that entire past arc in 26 years ago at calm, comfy campground,

18:16.080 --> 18:17.520
was going to be something else.

18:17.520 --> 18:21.680
So, um, because Joe went to a different place.

18:21.680 --> 18:22.320
Yeah.

18:22.320 --> 18:22.800
Wow.

18:25.840 --> 18:32.720
Luke, uh, if you would have worked the wheelchair angle more, I would have made sure that

18:32.720 --> 18:33.840
Contingent had ramps.

18:35.600 --> 18:36.800
Contingent had ramps.

18:36.800 --> 18:37.840
Is that what you said?

18:37.840 --> 18:38.080
Yeah.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.520
I would just would have made sure that Contingent was like, uh, compliant.

18:41.520 --> 18:41.840
It is.

18:41.840 --> 18:42.320
It does.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.200
Disability friendly.

18:43.200 --> 18:43.600
Oh yeah.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.000
Of course.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.880
Like all the businesses, they're super chill about that.

18:46.880 --> 18:52.400
So, uh, Jayhawk Inc also asked what made you choose the specifics for this Delta green

18:52.400 --> 18:55.840
game and went on to say, you're playing a group of police officers who are stumbling

18:55.840 --> 19:00.720
into mythos rather than a group of seasoned agents on a sanctioned DG mission or a mix

19:00.720 --> 19:05.600
of seasoned rookie agents or agents based on expertise agents in general, right?

19:05.600 --> 19:09.440
So really there's a broad scale in how much Delta green lore and specifics you use and

19:09.440 --> 19:11.040
how much you deviate and homebrew.

19:11.040 --> 19:16.160
And I'm curious how we ended up in contention PD as opposed to anything else that could

19:16.160 --> 19:17.280
have been, you know?

19:17.280 --> 19:23.040
So why did we start as novices to the mythos, not seasoned professionals like you do in

19:23.040 --> 19:24.640
a lot of Delta green scenarios?

19:24.640 --> 19:25.280
Exactly.

19:25.280 --> 19:31.440
And why are we playing in like a place we made up, I guess maybe in like a sandbox town

19:31.440 --> 19:35.200
instead of like a mission, like where you are sent somewhere?

19:35.200 --> 19:40.240
Well, I'll answer part of it cause I remember you, cause the character stuff obviously I

19:40.240 --> 19:45.600
can't help with, but I remember you saying that the, the idea of the small town thing

19:45.600 --> 19:48.640
was always like really appealing to you.

19:48.640 --> 19:54.720
And we kind of all liked those stories being from the Midwest and having been to some very

19:54.720 --> 20:00.240
small towns in our lifetime where just like weird crap kind of happens all the time, but

20:00.240 --> 20:05.600
taking it to like the super extreme and how would a small town react to like the supernatural

20:05.600 --> 20:09.040
elements and stuff like is just, I think that's just fun.

20:09.040 --> 20:09.440
Yeah.

20:09.440 --> 20:13.440
And I've wanted to run a sandbox for a while, like right, right.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.480
And run a sandbox.

20:15.040 --> 20:20.800
So that definitely had some to do with it, but also we just like, I think we came together

20:20.800 --> 20:22.000
with that idea, right?

20:22.000 --> 20:26.320
Like it was already going to be a small town when we met for the session zero.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.200
I think so.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.640
And I don't know.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.720
I personally think it's a lot more fun this way.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.320
Yeah, I agree.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.880
Delta green missions are great.

20:34.880 --> 20:38.160
They're just not really how we've played campaigns in the past.

20:38.800 --> 20:44.320
And we, so, Oh, that's something we can say that this is pretty much how we did two full

20:44.320 --> 20:49.280
like year long campaigns just around our table and kind of a little bit sandboxy.

20:49.280 --> 20:52.960
Not, we didn't have a whole made up town or anything, but sure.

20:52.960 --> 20:53.280
Yeah.

20:53.280 --> 20:59.440
It was basically just like, I would take pre-written adventures from either call of Cthulhu or

20:59.440 --> 21:00.480
Delta green.

21:00.480 --> 21:07.440
And then I would mess with them and then make little like connecting scenarios to play in

21:07.440 --> 21:12.000
between to kind of make the overall thread of whatever story we were telling connect

21:12.000 --> 21:14.560
to itself, spiderwebs and all that.

21:15.280 --> 21:20.240
I also think having a stumble into mysteries is fun from an audience standpoint that they're

21:20.240 --> 21:25.200
learning and freaking out about things along with us that you maybe not, you maybe wouldn't

21:25.200 --> 21:29.600
get if our characters were so hardened that none of this was new to them.

21:29.600 --> 21:33.120
It's kind of fun that we're freaking out with weird shit in character and out.

21:33.120 --> 21:33.600
Agreed.

21:33.600 --> 21:40.320
I also love introducing the lore of Delta green, like whatever bits I choose to use

21:40.320 --> 21:41.840
from the actual Delta green.

21:41.840 --> 21:48.080
And then the ones that I make up and add, I love like sneaking that in slowly to a story

21:48.080 --> 21:50.560
of people who are relatively normal.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.960
I mean, it's, it's also fun.

21:52.960 --> 21:59.680
This is it's fun as a player because I personally have never done any research about Delta green

21:59.680 --> 22:03.600
lore or it's fun to, I've read a bunch of Lovecraft.

22:04.240 --> 22:10.320
So, you know, I'm obviously familiar with Lovecraftian themes, but I don't own a Delta

22:10.320 --> 22:11.600
green handbook or anything.

22:12.480 --> 22:13.280
Keep it that way.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.640
Have we just been running the default scenario?

22:21.600 --> 22:23.760
Welcome to conviction USA.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.360
A small town like any other.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.840
Everyone on the threads are like, we don't play that one.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.040
It's not very well written.

22:33.840 --> 22:39.120
I actually wanted to say one time I played a Delta green mission and because someone

22:39.120 --> 22:44.480
was like, so up to date with a lot of the Delta green lore, some weird monster of some

22:44.480 --> 22:49.520
kind was spawning somewhere and they were already like, Oh, I know what this thing is.

22:49.520 --> 22:54.560
But it was weird that their character would like, their character shouldn't know that.

22:54.640 --> 22:59.840
And so it became this weird thing of them being like, Oh, I have to like pretend I don't

22:59.840 --> 23:00.480
know this.

23:00.480 --> 23:00.880
I don't know.

23:00.880 --> 23:05.280
It's kind of more interesting to use the rule set, but then kind of be able to insert your

23:05.280 --> 23:07.120
own fiction within it.

23:07.120 --> 23:11.200
And then that way there's not people who are like, Oh, I know what's coming.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.400
Like, yeah.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.600
And I guess it's, that's not really a problem if you're playing somebody who is supposed

23:15.600 --> 23:18.240
to be a seasoned Delta green agent, right?

23:18.240 --> 23:18.880
Yeah, totally.

23:18.880 --> 23:23.200
But their, their character was like just a small town, like park ranger or something.

23:23.680 --> 23:28.160
Which I just, I think it's way more fun to play normal people exposed to this than it

23:28.160 --> 23:28.720
is to.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.320
Yes, I think so too.

23:30.320 --> 23:36.400
One of my favorite ways to play is as a Delta green agent who has gone on one mission before

23:36.960 --> 23:44.400
and has like one experience, but that's the interesting thing about a seasoned quote unquote

23:44.400 --> 23:50.640
Delta green agent means they've probably like been doing it for not that long and not been

23:50.640 --> 23:56.320
on very mission, very many missions, because if they had, they're probably loosey goosey

23:56.320 --> 23:58.400
or a deady wetty.

23:58.400 --> 24:09.120
And so as this virus ravages our nation, a lot more people are going to wind up deady

24:09.120 --> 24:09.520
wetty.

24:09.520 --> 24:13.680
So let's try to be respectful.

24:14.480 --> 24:17.600
We've got another question here from feared reindeer.

24:17.600 --> 24:23.280
It says, if you each had to give one bit of advice to someone, what would it be?

24:24.400 --> 24:24.960
Don't listen to me.

24:24.960 --> 24:29.280
First off, I just want to say, yeah, none of us are in any position to give any advice.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.080
I think I am.

24:33.760 --> 24:36.800
No, just be patient with everyone you meet.

24:36.800 --> 24:42.960
Try to be, if they don't, if they do things that seem irrational or not understandable

24:42.960 --> 24:46.080
to you, just know they're probably coming from a really different place.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.680
And yeah, just don't be a Dick.

24:47.680 --> 24:56.800
Don't, I don't like people who get like angry, like my stepdad perception is reality.

24:56.800 --> 24:57.300
Mark.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.160
I have a good one.

25:00.160 --> 25:06.320
If, if some, unless someone else wants to step up, if you're already talking, just like,

25:06.320 --> 25:07.840
stop interrupting me.

25:10.480 --> 25:15.200
My advice is so like I was saying, yeah, yeah.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.240
That's what I'm saying.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.760
Justin, this is a year.

25:19.280 --> 25:19.920
He's mean.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.240
Hey, do you see what's happened?

25:26.800 --> 25:27.280
You know what?

25:27.280 --> 25:29.440
It's worth it to break free of your oppressive.

25:32.880 --> 25:33.520
My advice.

25:33.520 --> 25:42.000
This is something I said in, in the discord is, uh, is nevermind.

25:42.000 --> 25:42.480
I forgot.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.880
It was a bitches get paid.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.640
He realized that he probably shouldn't say it.

25:51.440 --> 25:51.840
Yeah.

25:51.840 --> 25:52.720
It's not cool.

25:52.720 --> 25:53.440
Cause he doesn't.

25:56.320 --> 25:57.040
Oh my God.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.160
I'm a fucking idiot.

25:59.760 --> 26:02.960
I was really ready for some shit.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.520
Like I was ready to be enlightened.

26:05.520 --> 26:05.920
Luke.

26:05.920 --> 26:08.720
Do you have any advice for the listeners at home?

26:08.720 --> 26:10.560
Find a therapist you like.

26:10.560 --> 26:11.200
Yup.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.000
It helps.

26:12.000 --> 26:12.400
Nice.

26:12.400 --> 26:13.360
Mine's Mark.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.160
Shout out to Mark.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.000
Oh, nice.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.400
Thomas's stepdad is Luke's therapist.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.840
Uh, I yelled marker earlier.

26:25.840 --> 26:31.760
Uh, so my, what's your advice?

26:34.320 --> 26:35.600
My advice.

26:35.600 --> 26:36.240
Oh fuck.

26:36.240 --> 26:37.360
Am I going to Justin it?

26:37.360 --> 26:38.240
I remembered mine.

26:39.200 --> 26:40.240
Perfect timing.

26:40.240 --> 26:41.440
Do you want me to go?

26:41.440 --> 26:42.160
Yes.

26:42.160 --> 26:42.880
Okay.

26:42.880 --> 26:47.200
So mine is a, it's kind of like a mindfulness based thing, which is, uh,

26:47.200 --> 26:52.160
take control of what you can and what you can control, make plans of action,

26:52.160 --> 26:57.680
begrudgingly accept what you can't control and move on and be kind like Thomas said.

26:58.320 --> 26:58.640
Yeah.

26:58.640 --> 27:03.520
Everyone like, just be kind to each other, no matter what the haps are.

27:03.520 --> 27:07.360
Unless someone's being a real big piece of shit, then you can be a dick to them.

27:07.600 --> 27:13.920
But like the average person, you don't know what's, you don't know what's going

27:13.920 --> 27:14.640
on in their life.

27:14.640 --> 27:16.320
Like we do know what's going on with Zach.

27:16.320 --> 27:17.760
He's just mean and malicious.

27:17.760 --> 27:18.260
Yeah.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.360
We met his nice parents.

27:21.360 --> 27:22.800
We know it's just genetic.

27:22.800 --> 27:23.300
Yeah.

27:24.400 --> 27:27.040
I mean, not, we know it's, yeah.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.520
Like you got it from a grandpa or something.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.360
They definitely nurtured you, right?

27:31.360 --> 27:33.920
Oh, my grandpa's a dick.

27:33.920 --> 27:34.320
Yeah.

27:34.320 --> 27:34.720
Like you.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.360
It's good to see you guys.

27:39.360 --> 27:39.600
Yeah.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.200
It's really good to hang out again.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.000
But yeah, I want to amend my answer.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.680
Don't be be patient with everyone except for Zach.

27:52.800 --> 27:53.520
Oh man.

27:54.320 --> 27:58.480
My advice is to, uh, to ask questions.

27:58.480 --> 27:59.200
Good one.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.400
Like, what did you touch?

28:02.880 --> 28:03.680
What's that smell?

28:04.640 --> 28:06.240
I like, uh, what's wrong with you?

28:06.960 --> 28:11.360
When I was in high school, I think like, is your face stuck like that?

28:12.560 --> 28:17.120
When I was in high school, my face was stuck in this really, like I thought

28:17.120 --> 28:20.800
attractive position, but that's just because I looked in the mirror all the

28:20.800 --> 28:23.600
time and they say, the more you see something, the more attractive you

28:23.600 --> 28:30.560
think it is, uh, which I'm finding in marriage, but no, it's, uh, it's,

28:30.560 --> 28:35.040
it's just a, like when someone like talks about a band and asks if you've

28:35.040 --> 28:39.360
heard of them and you like have heard of them, but you haven't listened to

28:39.360 --> 28:45.440
them, like, just ask, I don't know, like, don't act like you know everything.

28:45.440 --> 28:45.680
Okay.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.440
So that's, that's wrong.

28:47.440 --> 28:48.720
That's wrong listeners.

28:48.720 --> 28:51.760
You should, you should be like, oh yeah, I've heard of them.

28:51.760 --> 28:52.800
I've heard of them.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.080
I prefer their earlier stuff.

28:56.080 --> 28:59.040
Just like ask people questions and learn more.

28:59.040 --> 28:59.440
Nice.

28:59.440 --> 28:59.920
I like that.

28:59.920 --> 29:00.560
Good advice.

29:01.120 --> 29:03.680
Or front like, you know,

29:06.000 --> 29:06.480
shut up.

29:08.240 --> 29:09.440
Front it till you crown it.

29:12.160 --> 29:12.880
That was good.

29:12.880 --> 29:13.440
I liked it.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.160
Joe.

29:14.160 --> 29:14.880
Hey Joe.

29:14.880 --> 29:15.200
Yeah.

29:15.200 --> 29:15.920
Hey Joe.

29:15.920 --> 29:16.240
Hi.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.960
Give us some really good advice and don't embarrass yourself.

29:18.960 --> 29:19.840
Like Zach just did.

29:21.920 --> 29:22.800
Fin for yourself.

29:28.000 --> 29:28.800
You heard it here.

29:29.920 --> 29:33.840
Fucking number one, numero uno, baby.

29:34.560 --> 29:36.000
Figure it out for number one.

29:36.000 --> 29:36.960
It's Joe Terry.

29:38.560 --> 29:42.480
I absolutely adore this next question.

29:43.200 --> 29:47.440
We got it on Twitter and it's from at crane song.

29:47.440 --> 29:53.440
And it says, if contention had continued to be boring and normal and the boys had

29:53.440 --> 29:58.800
just kept on their normal person trajectory, what would their future have looked like?

29:58.800 --> 30:01.600
Would they marry, have kids retire early?

30:01.600 --> 30:05.200
And then they also, they said, I humbly offer unto you this blep.

30:05.200 --> 30:09.360
And they had a nice picture of the cat with a little blep and that was very nice.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.240
Cute cat.

30:10.240 --> 30:16.640
Clark would definitely still be at the station and he would be eternally waiting for Maggie

30:16.640 --> 30:21.120
to vacate her position position so that he could take over.

30:21.120 --> 30:25.680
But I foresee it being like a Prince Charles thing that he, she would be there forever

30:25.680 --> 30:28.400
and he would grow old and probably never get his goal.

30:29.760 --> 30:30.720
That sounds right.

30:30.720 --> 30:31.680
That's so sad.

30:32.400 --> 30:35.360
That might be sadder than what actually happens to Clark Bishop.

30:38.320 --> 30:40.320
Oh no, he's definitely living his best life now.

30:42.480 --> 30:46.960
I think also something Clark would be doing in five years is probably arresting John Lee

30:46.960 --> 30:54.320
Pettymore for like either John Lee Pettymore would have devolved into like the same

30:54.320 --> 30:59.920
criminality he got up to in the podcast or he would have really gone hard on the cop

30:59.920 --> 31:03.840
thing, gotten into some pretty questionable Facebook groups.

31:03.840 --> 31:04.960
Oh God.

31:04.960 --> 31:05.440
Yeah.

31:05.440 --> 31:08.960
It's not a, it's not a bright, uh, it doesn't look good.

31:08.960 --> 31:11.920
Let's hope John Lee Pettymore stays the path.

31:11.920 --> 31:16.720
You know those people who are like, who hate AOC, but also clearly are like obsessed with

31:16.720 --> 31:16.960
her?

31:20.240 --> 31:23.760
I don't go to that part of the internet or at least I try to stay away from it.

31:23.760 --> 31:26.800
I go to the parts of the internet that make fun of that part of the internet.

31:27.520 --> 31:28.080
There you go.

31:29.040 --> 31:33.280
Do you think John Lee Pettymore would have like a bunch of kids with multiple women or

31:33.280 --> 31:36.000
is he a little more like, I'm a one woman kind of guy, man?

31:36.880 --> 31:37.680
I really don't know.

31:38.560 --> 31:45.760
I think, I think he, uh, I met a guy once who was, um, extremely just like Missouri

31:45.760 --> 31:47.360
in a lot of ways, this electrician.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.160
And we were talking when I was like 23 and he was like, so you're not going to get like

31:52.160 --> 31:54.160
married or have kids anytime soon.

31:54.240 --> 31:58.240
And I was like, yeah, I never, uh, I never really wanted kids.

31:58.240 --> 32:01.520
And he like stopped and he was like, Oh, huh.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.800
I never even thought about not having kids.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.600
I think John might've been a little bit like that.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.080
He's just like, yeah, it's what you do, right?

32:14.080 --> 32:14.880
Like, sure.

32:14.880 --> 32:15.600
That's good.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.720
What's Keith's story?

32:16.720 --> 32:19.840
Keith, uh, works there for about a year.

32:19.840 --> 32:20.960
Gets fired.

32:20.960 --> 32:27.920
Um, can't, uh, hold down a job eventually becomes homeless until his brother finally

32:27.920 --> 32:29.120
takes pity on him.

32:29.120 --> 32:31.040
Um, lets him live at his house.

32:31.760 --> 32:41.200
And then Keith becomes like a manager of some small part of the beans Corp and probably

32:41.200 --> 32:42.720
kills his brother at some point.

32:42.720 --> 32:50.560
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if, if, if he like hired you as security or something

32:50.560 --> 32:53.440
and then you accidentally shot him in the head.

32:53.440 --> 32:56.880
I think that's like what happened to John F.

32:56.880 --> 32:57.440
Kennedy.

32:58.320 --> 32:58.820
Yeah.

32:59.440 --> 33:04.480
There's a 30 rock bit where Tracy says he knows his dad is dead because he's a celebrity.

33:05.360 --> 33:10.640
And if his dad wasn't dead, he'd be paying him 250,000 dollars a year to mow his lawn.

33:12.880 --> 33:15.520
That's such a good job.

33:15.520 --> 33:21.520
So yeah, Keith, Keith is, uh, probably better, better off with the shit going down now.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.760
Drew Andrews, I think would eventually.

33:24.400 --> 33:24.640
Okay.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.160
First of all, no one asked Zach.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.120
Oh man, did they not?

33:30.480 --> 33:31.520
That's another question.

33:33.200 --> 33:34.080
Tell us about Drew.

33:34.080 --> 33:34.800
I'm just being a dick.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.320
There's another Drew Andrews question.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.520
No, you're right.

33:37.520 --> 33:39.120
It didn't, it didn't ask.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.240
Yeah, not now.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.600
Wait your turns.

33:42.880 --> 33:43.440
I'm sorry.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.880
Guys, I feel so bad.

33:51.200 --> 33:52.000
Say it like Drew.

33:53.040 --> 33:56.480
Guys, I feel so, I mean, contention police office.

33:56.480 --> 33:57.760
This is Drew speaking.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.280
Oh, I love him.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.640
Yes, that makes me miss that.

34:00.640 --> 34:01.360
I love Drew.

34:01.920 --> 34:02.480
He's dead.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.360
We got another question here.

34:09.440 --> 34:12.960
That dude, no one knows says, is there a PO box?

34:12.960 --> 34:14.160
We can send you beer.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.480
We'll be setting one up shortly.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.240
Yeah, just because you said that.

34:19.040 --> 34:19.840
Hey, shut the fuck up.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.120
And we got another one.

34:25.120 --> 34:26.720
When are you coming out with merch?

34:26.720 --> 34:28.320
Cause I need that shit.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.720
That is also very soon.

34:30.720 --> 34:36.160
We've got some really cool shit lined up and I'm very excited for you all to see it.

34:36.160 --> 34:37.680
Every size of cock ring.

34:40.000 --> 34:44.480
The colostomy bags with, with the logo on them.

34:44.480 --> 34:45.520
Pet caskets.

34:47.600 --> 34:50.560
Dude, pet caskets is so good.

34:50.560 --> 34:50.960
Yeah, I know.

34:50.960 --> 34:55.600
That's why we're going to be shipping them out pretty soon to everybody's who's already

34:55.600 --> 34:56.880
pre-ordered a pet casket.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.040
Which is most of you.

34:59.040 --> 35:03.920
Thank you so much for going to my best friend died.

35:03.920 --> 35:04.800
What do I do now?

35:04.800 --> 35:05.840
Dot com.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.440
Thankfully we were able to get that.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.560
Uh, so yeah, that'll be out soon.

35:12.560 --> 35:13.520
I'm really excited about it.

35:14.080 --> 35:19.680
What is your favorite system for quick one shot slash introducing people to RP?

35:20.480 --> 35:24.320
I mean just right off the bat, Delta green, Delta green, and it's the best one.

35:24.320 --> 35:28.080
And it's, I think the best way to introduce people to role playing.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.680
It's super easy to play.

35:29.680 --> 35:30.880
Super intriguing.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.080
I fucking love it.

35:32.080 --> 35:32.480
I agree.

35:32.480 --> 35:33.040
A hundred percent.

35:33.040 --> 35:36.960
And the one shots are just always a fucking blast and you can get them done in three or

35:36.960 --> 35:38.640
four hours usually.

35:38.640 --> 35:39.040
Yeah.

35:39.040 --> 35:39.920
What about you, Justin?

35:39.920 --> 35:44.160
Uh, don't do what I did, which is try and learn an entire new system you've never played

35:44.160 --> 35:48.000
and then try and run brand new people through it while you're also learning it.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.800
Cause I tried that with dungeon world and it became a mess.

35:50.800 --> 35:55.760
Even though dungeon world seems super dope, having all new people with like a more complex

35:55.760 --> 36:00.320
system than like others, like the dice rolling mechanic was really easy, but like all the

36:00.320 --> 36:04.000
other character building and other stuff was what is dungeon world.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.720
How's it different from like D and D you, uh, gosh, I haven't played it in so long,

36:08.720 --> 36:13.440
but the crux of it is like most roles are accomplished with two D six if I remember

36:13.440 --> 36:13.760
right.

36:13.760 --> 36:16.720
And a third of them are you get to do what you want.

36:16.720 --> 36:22.080
A third are you kind of succeed, but I get, but I get to take something from you.

36:22.080 --> 36:25.680
And then the other third are like you fail, which I thought was really cool, but it can

36:25.680 --> 36:26.640
be a little confusing.

36:26.640 --> 36:30.960
I think Delta green is really good for most people to start on.

36:30.960 --> 36:32.160
It's easy to wrap your head around.

36:32.160 --> 36:33.200
It's just percentages.

36:33.200 --> 36:36.560
So you kind of get an idea right off the bat, how good or bad at a thing you are.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.240
So you can kind of role play that a little easier.

36:38.240 --> 36:40.320
It's easier to build the characters too.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.240
I feel like, Oh, absolutely.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.080
I think Delta green's like awesome.

36:44.080 --> 36:46.400
I'm about to probably run some friends through it.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.880
And I was like, this seems like the way to go.

36:49.840 --> 36:50.320
Yeah.

36:50.320 --> 36:59.200
I also think that the mechanics of a game are always the part I care least about and

36:59.200 --> 37:02.960
the mechanics get in the way as little as possible.

37:02.960 --> 37:03.520
Exactly.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.800
That's my thing too.

37:04.800 --> 37:08.960
I want to tell a cool story with my buds, not play a tactics.

37:08.960 --> 37:09.360
I'm sorry.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.440
You want to tell a cool story with your butt?

37:13.200 --> 37:14.640
Dude, you fucking got me.

37:17.440 --> 37:17.840
Sorry.

37:17.840 --> 37:18.240
I'm real.

37:18.240 --> 37:18.720
I'm real.

37:18.720 --> 37:19.680
COVID caddy.

37:19.680 --> 37:20.080
I'm real.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.640
I'm real quarantine caddy tonight.

37:24.640 --> 37:25.840
Quarantine caddy.

37:26.480 --> 37:32.080
Final question from that dude no one knows is will drew ever get his teeth fixed and

37:32.080 --> 37:34.640
be as successful as his paramedic cousin?

37:34.960 --> 37:38.320
Oh, yes and no.

37:38.320 --> 37:40.480
He's just as successful in our hearts.

37:41.200 --> 37:45.440
I mean, he is not good at what he does, but he's a good friend.

37:48.320 --> 37:49.760
He was always there for me.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.280
He was actually, yeah, he's fantastic.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.360
I made $5 million with that motherfucker.

37:56.560 --> 37:58.000
So he could get his tooth fixed.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.280
That's not an issue.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.160
Our next question is

38:02.160 --> 38:06.240
is from room service nachos.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.040
That's me.

38:07.040 --> 38:10.160
That's like, that sounds familiar.

38:11.600 --> 38:12.240
Yes.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.440
What's in my pocket?

38:13.440 --> 38:14.160
Oh, it's a ring.

38:14.880 --> 38:16.160
I've read that book.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.600
Yeah, it's pretty good.

38:17.600 --> 38:26.720
Harry Potter number three, I think number three, Harry Potter number three, Harry Potter

38:26.720 --> 38:27.440
and Luke.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.400
What's in your pocket right now?

38:28.960 --> 38:29.840
Let's see wallet.

38:29.840 --> 38:30.560
I'm calling wallet.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.560
Like just a bunch of condoms.

38:34.560 --> 38:34.880
Fuck.

38:34.880 --> 38:38.240
If we'd actually been playing, we could have super one.

38:38.240 --> 38:39.360
That would have been really easy.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.760
Yeah, that would have been my passport.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.240
Are you all like ready to evacuate?

38:47.120 --> 38:49.120
Just in case, baby.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.320
Some people have go bags.

38:50.320 --> 38:51.280
He has go pants.

38:53.840 --> 38:57.200
And a salt rifle tweezers tweezers.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.800
Now you take care of that unibrow.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.680
I know I was picking nose hairs out of my nose.

39:01.680 --> 39:03.680
Oh, you pull them.

39:03.680 --> 39:04.640
Yeah, I don't have many.

39:04.640 --> 39:05.920
So I just do it.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.200
It's kind of fun to pull them.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.120
If you're a pervert like me and Luca.

39:12.400 --> 39:13.680
It makes me sneeze.

39:13.680 --> 39:14.960
I know I like it though.

39:14.960 --> 39:15.760
Oh, okay.

39:15.760 --> 39:16.000
Yeah.

39:17.040 --> 39:19.200
I can't come unless I sneeze.

39:19.200 --> 39:20.240
Oh, there it is.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.040
Dude, that.

39:23.040 --> 39:23.280
Okay.

39:23.280 --> 39:29.440
There was this dumb ass like book of facts that was given to me for Christmas one year.

39:29.440 --> 39:30.640
This is in there too.

39:30.640 --> 39:33.040
And it's holding up his driver's license.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.160
Go ahead and screen cap that.

39:34.160 --> 39:34.720
Put it on there.

39:34.720 --> 39:35.440
Audio.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.800
Audio medium.

39:36.800 --> 39:41.760
So in this book of facts, it was like your brain can't tell the difference between

39:41.760 --> 39:43.200
sneezing and an orgasm.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.160
And it's like my brain can.

39:46.160 --> 39:47.200
Obviously it can.

39:47.840 --> 39:55.120
Obviously you're never like, oh, I've got to go change my pants when you sneeze.

39:55.120 --> 40:01.120
It was always like a rumor going around when we were kids that a sneeze was an eighth of

40:01.120 --> 40:02.160
an orgasm.

40:02.160 --> 40:02.400
Yeah.

40:03.120 --> 40:08.240
And so if you sneeze twice, you'd be like, oh, a quarter of an orgasm.

40:09.440 --> 40:09.920
Yeah.

40:09.920 --> 40:14.720
And then if you got the elusive eight in a row sneeze, then you had to leave.

40:14.720 --> 40:15.440
You completed.

40:15.440 --> 40:16.080
Yeah.

40:16.080 --> 40:16.720
That's different.

40:16.720 --> 40:19.040
Like eight sneezes in a row sucks.

40:19.040 --> 40:19.680
Oh God.

40:19.680 --> 40:20.560
Can you imagine?

40:20.560 --> 40:27.680
I think the closest thing you can get is like, you can get, I think like a third of an orgasm

40:27.680 --> 40:30.000
is like taking a really long, satisfying piss.

40:30.560 --> 40:30.960
Ooh.

40:30.960 --> 40:31.520
Yeah.

40:31.520 --> 40:34.240
Oh, after a movie or something, maybe a quarter.

40:34.240 --> 40:35.200
What about just, all right.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.480
You got another question here.

40:39.120 --> 40:39.280
Yeah.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.280
If you push your pants twice, you're halfway there.

40:43.120 --> 40:44.320
I'm living on a prayer.

40:44.320 --> 40:44.640
Okay.

40:44.640 --> 40:50.000
Nothing for asks is Alan Grimes based on Walter Mathau.

40:50.000 --> 40:57.280
So here's the thing I really fucked up because Alan Grimes was originally based on Walter

40:57.280 --> 40:59.040
Cronkite and Walter Mathau.

40:59.600 --> 41:06.400
But then like, as Thomas pointed out, definitely turned into, um, Nixon and Nixon and Mathau.

41:08.400 --> 41:08.720
Yeah.

41:09.600 --> 41:15.360
But that is why I kept calling him Walter, even though Luke's character's name was Walter

41:15.360 --> 41:21.120
because I had set him up as a Walter in my head and then made his son or not son's name

41:21.120 --> 41:22.080
Walter.

41:22.080 --> 41:22.560
Yeah.

41:22.560 --> 41:25.200
That was a silly, silly call on my end.

41:26.640 --> 41:28.080
They got another question here.

41:28.080 --> 41:28.960
I liked this one a lot.

41:28.960 --> 41:34.240
Each person name and describe their favorite tourist attraction in or around Springfield,

41:34.240 --> 41:36.240
Missouri difficulty level.

41:36.240 --> 41:39.200
You may not give the same answer as someone else.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.600
Ooh, I'm going to go for the obvious one then.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.680
Cause I think it's legitimately awesome.

41:43.680 --> 41:47.920
The new aquarium in town is legitimately world-class.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.680
It's uh, it's the best pro guy.

41:50.720 --> 41:51.520
Johnny Morris.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.760
Wonders of wildlife aquarium.

41:55.760 --> 41:56.640
Still haven't been.

41:56.640 --> 41:57.520
I've been twice.

41:57.520 --> 41:58.240
It's really cool.

41:58.240 --> 41:59.360
Go to the aquarium.

41:59.360 --> 42:01.280
Don't go to the other part.

42:01.280 --> 42:03.280
Which is animal trophies.

42:04.080 --> 42:04.480
Yeah.

42:04.480 --> 42:07.360
It's like under the guise of conservation.

42:07.360 --> 42:11.360
It's just like, look who all these like rich fucks have shot.

42:11.360 --> 42:11.680
Yeah.

42:11.680 --> 42:18.800
And literally the signs next to the giraffes or the elephants say this animal was taken

42:18.800 --> 42:25.920
by and then the name and then sometimes there's pictures of like Johnny Morris is like shit

42:25.920 --> 42:29.040
eating nephews, like next to dead rhinos and shit.

42:29.040 --> 42:30.480
And it's like, what the fuck?

42:30.480 --> 42:30.720
Yeah.

42:30.720 --> 42:32.320
It's really, it's really creepy.

42:32.320 --> 42:34.640
But the aquarium is great.

42:34.640 --> 42:36.960
The aquarium is super duper dope.

42:36.960 --> 42:43.040
You should go to a Casper's when you, I'll avoid the, the like obvious tour tourist traps,

42:43.040 --> 42:44.960
but you should go to Casper's.

42:44.960 --> 42:50.720
It's this cool old, uh, burger joint in a, uh, in an authentic old Quonset hut.

42:50.720 --> 42:54.080
That's a cool part of like Springfield LGBT history.

42:54.080 --> 42:56.800
And they have dope burgers.

42:56.800 --> 43:00.320
Wait, I didn't know it was, uh, I didn't know it was an ally.

43:00.960 --> 43:06.000
Uh, the guy who ran it forever, uh, from like the seventies until the early two thousands

43:06.000 --> 43:07.360
or even a little later.

43:07.360 --> 43:08.160
Oh, that's sick.

43:08.160 --> 43:11.760
Me and my dad used to go there for lunch every week and get Frito pie.

43:11.760 --> 43:12.080
Yeah.

43:12.080 --> 43:14.000
The chili there was dope.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.600
I do like how they serve the chili in the bowls where it's like totally overflowing.

43:17.600 --> 43:18.160
Yes.

43:18.160 --> 43:22.080
It's completely overflowing.

43:22.080 --> 43:23.280
Like slopped in there.

43:23.280 --> 43:25.600
I have one also food adjacent.

43:26.160 --> 43:28.480
Try some cashew chicken when you come here.

43:28.480 --> 43:28.880
Yeah.

43:28.880 --> 43:30.240
Yeah, we invented it.

43:30.240 --> 43:31.280
Motherfuckers.

43:31.280 --> 43:32.000
It's really good.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.880
If you just want some weird fried chicken breast or thigh or whatever battered and with

43:36.880 --> 43:41.840
just like a salty soy sauce over it, it's decadent and delicious.

43:41.840 --> 43:46.560
If you go to a Chinese place near your place and you ask for cashew chicken, you will not

43:46.560 --> 43:48.000
get what we're talking about.

43:48.000 --> 43:52.240
Hers is very specific to Springfield and it's, yeah, it's like fried chicken and gravy.

43:52.240 --> 43:52.720
It's great.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.320
It's a nap maker.

43:56.320 --> 44:01.120
But you can pretty much go to any good, cheap Chinese place in Springfield and get a pretty

44:01.120 --> 44:02.880
good version of it, which is kind of fun.

44:02.880 --> 44:04.320
For $4.50.

44:04.320 --> 44:04.720
Yeah.

44:04.720 --> 44:07.280
$4.50, a little side of rice and an egg roll.

44:07.280 --> 44:11.360
But there's really good places too if you want to actually get a little more.

44:11.360 --> 44:13.600
It's on the end that had the $4.50 forever.

44:13.600 --> 44:14.160
Yeah.

44:14.160 --> 44:15.120
What's your go-to Chinese place?

44:15.120 --> 44:17.920
I drove by the other day and they're like $5, $5.50 now.

44:17.920 --> 44:18.880
What the fuck?

44:18.880 --> 44:19.360
I know.

44:19.360 --> 44:19.840
Damn it.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.520
What's your go-to Chinese in Springfield?

44:24.080 --> 44:32.800
My favorite tourist attraction in and or around Springfield is not a Chinese food place, but

44:32.800 --> 44:36.720
it is exotic animal paradise.

44:36.720 --> 44:37.840
Oh yeah, dude.

44:38.880 --> 44:41.360
Well, which hasn't been called that for years, right?

44:41.360 --> 44:42.560
And is it even still open?

44:42.560 --> 44:43.360
I don't think so.

44:43.360 --> 44:44.880
Wait, is that the one where you drive through?

44:44.880 --> 44:47.920
It is open and you do drive through it.

44:47.920 --> 44:51.120
I think it's called Wild Animal Safari.

44:52.080 --> 44:59.120
The reason that it's my favorite, besides the animal abuse, is on a real note, it is

44:59.840 --> 45:01.920
probably some fucked up shit going on.

45:01.920 --> 45:06.240
But when I was a kid, I went there a lot and I have a lot of really good memories with

45:06.240 --> 45:12.240
my grandpa who passed away, who is the only grandparent who passed away when I was younger

45:12.240 --> 45:17.120
and therefore holds a really nice memory in my heart because I didn't get to find out

45:17.120 --> 45:18.320
that he was probably racist.

45:18.960 --> 45:25.520
And so all my memories of him are pure and he would always bring leather gloves with

45:25.520 --> 45:32.320
him so that he could unroll the window and pet the ostriches who would then peck at his

45:32.320 --> 45:34.960
hands and grab onto his gloves.

45:34.960 --> 45:36.080
And it was very fun.

45:36.640 --> 45:41.680
One of my favorite memories growing up was driving through there and him rolling the

45:41.680 --> 45:47.360
window all the way down and leaning the seat back in a buffalo put its entire head inside

45:47.360 --> 45:52.800
the minivan and started licking the ceiling and my grandma was just like freaking out.

45:52.800 --> 45:53.840
It was so funny.

45:55.200 --> 45:55.840
That's dope.

45:56.720 --> 45:59.120
Don't go there though if you come to Springfield.

45:59.120 --> 46:03.040
It's not as, well actually I haven't been, I haven't even seen the place in like 15 years

46:03.040 --> 46:06.480
so I can't, I don't know if the new owners are like Joe Exotic bad or not.

46:06.480 --> 46:08.160
They do have two tigers.

46:08.160 --> 46:12.400
Back in the day it was not like Joe Exotic's weird fucking zoo.

46:12.400 --> 46:14.160
They were like roaming around.

46:14.160 --> 46:19.040
There's also a real zoo where you can go and see the animals and they're well taken care of.

46:19.040 --> 46:22.160
Yeah they have like a medical team that takes care of them all at the ad.

46:22.960 --> 46:24.960
And the peacocks running around.

46:24.960 --> 46:26.880
All right we've got, did anyone?

46:26.880 --> 46:27.440
Hold on.

46:27.440 --> 46:28.000
Hold on Luke.

46:28.000 --> 46:28.800
Yeah we've got more.

46:30.080 --> 46:32.400
Fantastic Caverns is pretty cool.

46:32.400 --> 46:32.880
Oh hell yeah.

46:33.760 --> 46:36.640
Silver Dollar City, not really Springfield but close enough.

46:36.640 --> 46:37.920
It's so dope.

46:37.920 --> 46:40.240
Food is great and you gotta ride the rides.

46:40.240 --> 46:41.920
Are you a roller coaster guy?

46:41.920 --> 46:43.920
You gotta ride the rides or they won't let you eat the food.

46:44.160 --> 46:47.120
Yeah you have to throw, do the loops and throw.

46:47.120 --> 46:50.000
It's always fun to throw up on the people behind you as a goof.

46:50.560 --> 46:51.280
As a goof.

46:51.280 --> 46:52.320
As a good goof.

46:52.320 --> 46:53.040
I goofed you.

46:54.720 --> 47:00.320
We went there, Zach and I and our and our partners went there last year on acid and

47:00.320 --> 47:04.960
had a really fun time watching the old-fashioned glass blowers.

47:06.640 --> 47:07.920
That would be incredible.

47:07.920 --> 47:10.880
I was melting alongside the glass.

47:10.880 --> 47:11.600
It was really chill.

47:12.560 --> 47:14.960
I still have a knife that I bought when I was a kid.

47:14.960 --> 47:17.040
Like a pocket knife that was made there.

47:17.040 --> 47:18.080
It's pretty cool.

47:18.080 --> 47:25.600
We then took Thomas on a roller coaster that you sit in and it goes around like a like

47:25.600 --> 47:30.960
a carnival ride does but then it also goes on a roller coaster track so you're going

47:30.960 --> 47:35.040
spinning around while you're going upside down and doing corkscrews.

47:35.040 --> 47:39.040
Right like the car you're in itself like just spins all around on its axis.

47:39.920 --> 47:41.120
Which is my favorite.

47:42.640 --> 47:44.720
Yeah everyone loved it but me.

47:47.520 --> 47:49.920
I don't want to ride a roller coaster on acid again.

47:51.520 --> 47:53.520
Yeah I think that's really fair.

47:53.520 --> 47:54.800
It was scary.

47:54.800 --> 47:56.480
Did everybody say their favorite stuff?

47:57.280 --> 48:01.120
Oh we also have the world's biggest fork in Springfield.

48:01.120 --> 48:02.320
Do we really?

48:02.320 --> 48:04.800
Yeah it's over in Chesterfield village.

48:04.800 --> 48:09.520
What was the restaurant?

48:09.520 --> 48:13.600
I have to pee so I'm gonna ask I'm at my parents house I'm gonna ask them they probably

48:13.600 --> 48:13.920
remember.

48:13.920 --> 48:14.480
If you can pee.

48:17.200 --> 48:18.960
Hey guys would be cool if I did this.

48:18.960 --> 48:21.360
We're gonna we're gonna need to wrap this up because my parents said no.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.080
We have to watch they have to watch me do it.

48:24.080 --> 48:30.480
It's like my mom used to work in prison for a while so I'll be right back.

48:30.480 --> 48:35.840
Luke has a huge urethra so it's easy to smuggle contraband in with.

48:36.880 --> 48:39.120
It's more like splashing a bucket of water on the ground.

48:40.960 --> 48:41.520
No one talk.

48:42.160 --> 48:44.960
I'm also gonna go pee so I'll be right back.

48:44.960 --> 48:46.800
Is this it's pee break time it sounds like.

48:46.800 --> 48:47.520
Sounds like it.

48:47.520 --> 48:48.880
I might as well take advantage.

48:48.880 --> 48:50.000
I don't have to pee.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.200
I don't have to pee either.

48:51.200 --> 48:52.800
I'm just gonna stare down.

48:53.440 --> 48:54.160
Hi Justin.

48:54.880 --> 48:55.120
Hey.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Hey it's just you and me.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.920
It's just us now us two guys.

49:00.480 --> 49:01.760
Two fancy boys.

49:01.760 --> 49:03.280
Your beard looks incredible.

49:03.840 --> 49:04.240
Thank you.

49:04.240 --> 49:05.120
It's doing pretty well.

49:05.120 --> 49:05.840
I'm loving it.

49:05.840 --> 49:09.760
I went I went the opposite direction where I was like I need to change something about

49:09.760 --> 49:11.920
my life and I have control over my hair.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.280
It looks very sharp.

49:17.280 --> 49:17.760
Thank you.

49:17.760 --> 49:22.480
My mom was whenever I first shaved I'd like did like the more clean shaven thing and she

49:22.480 --> 49:26.880
was like she's like you look like you're 18 again and it's weirding me.

49:27.760 --> 49:32.000
It's like I'll take that as a compliment being a 30 year old boy.

49:33.520 --> 49:38.960
There's finally enough years on my face that I don't look like a total child when I shave

49:38.960 --> 49:43.840
but I do still have like weird baby face so it's like man baby.

49:47.200 --> 49:51.680
Have you been playing any dope games or anything or are you just watching a bunch of stuff or.

49:51.680 --> 49:55.440
I've been playing the fuck out of Total War Three Kingdoms.

49:55.440 --> 49:57.200
Oh I'm so jealous.

49:57.200 --> 49:58.080
It's super fun.

49:58.720 --> 50:01.440
My cousin actually bought it like gifted it for me.

50:01.440 --> 50:02.800
Oh wow that's awesome.

50:02.800 --> 50:03.680
Which was super nice.

50:03.680 --> 50:09.040
Yeah I just woke up and like got on my computer and was like your dope ass cousin has sent

50:09.040 --> 50:09.840
you a gift.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.120
Oh that's awesome.

50:11.120 --> 50:15.120
Because she bought her brother like the DLC for it the new DLC and she's like you guys

50:15.120 --> 50:18.560
should play multiplayer together which we haven't I've just we've both racked up like

50:20.560 --> 50:24.800
I can see his play count rising along with mine as we're just like at home alone.

50:24.800 --> 50:30.800
I've heard what game Total War Three Kingdoms the newest Total War game it's a lot of fun

50:30.800 --> 50:34.080
and the setting is really cool like ancient China.

50:34.080 --> 50:38.880
Yeah I love that whole setting I used to play all the Dynasty Warriors games just because

50:38.880 --> 50:44.160
I love that like the idea of that setting yeah and then realizing it was like actually

50:44.160 --> 50:48.800
a thing makes it even more interesting it makes me want to play the Total War stuff because

50:48.800 --> 50:53.760
I feel like they're a little more historical while still making the heroes more hero like

50:53.760 --> 50:56.560
but it's more a little grounded in a lot of other aspects.

50:56.560 --> 51:02.080
So you can play it like two ways which is kind of interesting romance or records is

51:02.080 --> 51:02.560
what they call it.

51:02.560 --> 51:03.600
Oh interesting.

51:04.400 --> 51:09.440
So romance is based more on just like the novels the romance of the three kingdoms yeah

51:09.440 --> 51:15.120
yeah and or just novel but and so it's it's also kind of inspired by the the war hammer

51:15.120 --> 51:16.240
Total War games.

51:16.240 --> 51:21.040
Yes yeah which are fantastical abilities and stuff and and and that your generals are just

51:21.040 --> 51:27.040
like single units who have like superhero level powers yes yeah or you can play it more

51:27.040 --> 51:29.680
old school Total War which is what I do.

51:29.680 --> 51:33.840
Both those sound interesting to me for like different reasons but it's like yeah yeah

51:33.840 --> 51:38.720
that's that that one's on my list for sure once it goes like just enough on sale it's

51:38.720 --> 51:42.720
going to be one of those ones I just like instant buy and probably put like way too

51:42.720 --> 51:43.920
many hours into.

51:44.720 --> 51:50.960
So they asked another question Okay Nothing Four asked are you going to set a new Patreon

51:50.960 --> 52:02.480
goal one million dollars you're the guy you tell us yeah I mean we will when we decide

52:02.480 --> 52:09.200
what we want it to be we'll probably come up with two or three ideas and let the patreons

52:09.200 --> 52:15.040
decide the patrons decide in a poll what the next goal will be so if your patron look out

52:15.040 --> 52:19.120
for that that'll be coming up shortly you will figure it out.

52:20.000 --> 52:25.360
They also asked for the players how much time do you each spend thinking about this campaign

52:25.360 --> 52:31.680
outside of recording sessions it just Thomas don't answer first it'll make it sound bad

52:36.320 --> 52:42.480
it just kind of depends on what you've told us to think about some specific things but

52:42.480 --> 52:49.680
I legitimately think about it a whole lot and sometimes I pull out my notebook and refresh

52:49.680 --> 52:57.920
myself on stuff okay sorry Thomas yeah yeah I mean you're right the answer the answer

52:57.920 --> 53:03.680
is not much I think about the act of I think about us spending time together and stuff

53:03.680 --> 53:09.600
like that but and like look forward to it yeah the act of physical love that we exactly

53:09.680 --> 53:13.600
that we engage in well that makes sense I'll think about like cool stuff we did or like

53:13.600 --> 53:21.360
things I might want to do or try to figure out but I am more with Thomas in this boat than uh

53:21.360 --> 53:27.200
Joe a lot of it is like it I it'll be cool to do this next week also this might suck for like the

53:27.200 --> 53:32.240
DM and like invested listeners to hear but I'm totally just here for the ride I'm have like

53:32.240 --> 53:36.240
it's really fun to experience the mystery like washing over you yeah if we think about it too

53:36.240 --> 53:43.760
much we might figure stuff out my animal yeah exactly how smart can how smart can Zach be

53:44.560 --> 53:51.520
if you actually go back and listen to it um pretty pretty fucking good at this man

53:53.360 --> 54:01.520
we know we know I would say even I think about it a lot while like making music and shit like

54:01.520 --> 54:06.240
I think about like what moments could possibly come up or like what would have been cool for

54:06.240 --> 54:12.080
another moment and also wolf wolf the dog in it every week obviously I'm like always kind of

54:12.080 --> 54:16.880
caught up on what's going on and then being in the show even it was like it's so it's so many like

54:16.880 --> 54:21.600
weird different angles that I feel like I've approached it from which is kind of kind of fun

54:21.600 --> 54:25.600
if I haven't been thinking about it at some point within the week I will start thinking about it

54:25.600 --> 54:31.200
again you know yeah yeah because I leave oh hit me I was gonna say this next question can

54:31.760 --> 54:37.200
lead into whatever your answer is to both this and the next question oh oh bless you Joe that

54:37.200 --> 54:41.680
was such a good transition I fucked it up immediately by thinking about it uh we got

54:42.480 --> 54:50.720
Joe Tapa Joe Tapa Joe Tapa jot a paw anyway asks Zach what does your session slash campaign

54:50.720 --> 54:56.160
preparation look like everyone how much time do you spend playing PTBP are you playing any other

54:56.160 --> 55:02.480
TT RPG real quick I'll just hit the what does my prep look like when I was first writing the

55:02.480 --> 55:10.480
campaign I would go to the public library so I didn't get distracted and I would sit down at a

55:10.480 --> 55:18.240
google doc and I would write out characters who lived in contention and then I like not at the

55:18.240 --> 55:24.240
very beginning like once I already had like the plots kind of slightly like the plot that happened

55:24.240 --> 55:30.880
before the podcast started essentially so I wrote all that out almost like a short story first and

55:30.880 --> 55:40.640
then I created NPCs out of that and then for week to week I do I actually like I write the campaign

55:40.640 --> 55:46.880
week to week now because I have no idea how their actions are gonna affect what we do next so I try

55:46.880 --> 55:54.720
not to plan too far in advance outside of like big moving pieces within the setting that's pretty

55:54.720 --> 55:59.840
much same here nice do you have any do you guys did that make sense to you guys no yeah yeah

56:02.640 --> 56:08.640
uh basically like if I if I have an idea of what their plan is or something I'll try to prep

56:09.200 --> 56:14.240
places people and motivation and that's it and then I've talked about bangs before on the other

56:14.320 --> 56:21.520
Q&A's yeah always having a few of those in back pocket is good so we've got are you guys playing

56:21.520 --> 56:28.000
any other RPGs I guess that question would have been maybe different before I'm still playing

56:28.000 --> 56:38.000
another delta green campaign I'm zooming it in tomorrow but he nobody else had ever played it

56:38.080 --> 56:41.920
and the guy running it is not me so I'm helping him out a little bit

56:42.880 --> 56:46.800
but it's fun it's called we're calling it the moldy worm campaign

56:48.080 --> 56:54.960
gross nice but yeah it's fun but it's no it's no PTBP wow way to downgrade your

56:56.000 --> 57:00.640
yeah that's rough shout out to I assume by everybody that listens to this

57:01.200 --> 57:04.560
so Tyler

57:07.200 --> 57:13.600
um I am actually haven't been playing any others but as I've vocalized a couple times here I've

57:13.600 --> 57:19.760
been wanting to to dip in a little bit with running some stuff and I think I'm going to try

57:20.400 --> 57:26.800
I didn't realize the core rule book of delta green and the one of the missions is free online it's

57:26.800 --> 57:31.760
called need to know and you can download it and it gives you all the information that you need to

57:31.760 --> 57:38.320
play your first game as well as a dope intro scenario exactly one we've ever done uh yes it's

57:38.320 --> 57:43.760
the one with Clyde Bauman I believe Joe is the only one who has not played it so I'm thinking

57:43.760 --> 57:48.320
of running some of my friends through that since uh we were kind of talking about doing it anyway

57:48.320 --> 57:53.920
and a great social distancing thing is a role playing online so I think that's going to be a

57:53.920 --> 57:59.280
big thing for me because I was like man I really would like to do this and it's fairly simple to

57:59.280 --> 58:03.360
set up stuff online especially delta green you don't need a board or anything

58:03.360 --> 58:07.200
to look at you just need your character sheets and your imaginations

58:14.080 --> 58:19.840
why I just think I'm the luckiest role player in the world because PTBP is my weekly game

58:19.840 --> 58:27.200
oh that's just so sweet of you Thomas why it is just so nice I appreciate the words that you say

58:27.200 --> 58:35.360
to me every time yeah I think I definitely got spoiled by this being my first uh roleplay group

58:35.360 --> 58:43.040
yeah like once we clicked and found each other uh especially reading horror stories on the internet

58:43.040 --> 58:49.120
and just like normal stories on the internet I was just like oh fuck we once we finally booted

58:49.120 --> 58:59.120
Alex really came together yeah happy birthday Alex oh no is it his birthday today it is I

58:59.120 --> 59:04.880
meant to call him I didn't fuck I didn't either oh no he's gonna take that very personally let's

59:04.880 --> 59:09.280
all text him right now I'll text him at the same time but how I'm I didn't get on Facebook how

59:09.280 --> 59:14.960
am I supposed to know uh because he's your friend I don't know it's not my fucking calendar

59:15.520 --> 59:23.440
yeah I don't either I said happy birthday cuck I said happy birthday dude exclamation point wow

59:23.440 --> 59:28.640
I said happy birthday my sweet babe oh I'm texting him from an unknown number and saying I'm gonna

59:28.640 --> 59:40.080
find you I have a very particular set of skills you guys like my Irish accent yeah that's really

59:40.080 --> 59:49.600
good I have a daughter oh no I still remember it like an early comedy bang bang where Kevin

59:49.600 --> 59:54.080
Pollock came on he was showing off his bit of like one word impersonations he's like can you

59:54.080 --> 59:59.120
find one word that gets to the uh like absolute essence of the person you're trying to uh

59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.160
impersonate sure and for Liam Neeson it was banana

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:10.480
oh that's really good he was like a little too proud of himself and he just kept saying it

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:14.720
yeah well that'll happen fun I've been thinking about it for like five years

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:22.720
worth it yeah hypothetically uh Joe Taba also I don't know how Joe Taba also asks

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:29.760
uh hypothetically if a gorilla uses sign language and asks that you eat it does the

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:35.440
gorilla's consent make the meat vegan or are you more worried that the gorilla might have

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:42.320
poisoned itself and is trying to kill you I don't trust anybody who's into vore uh gorilla or not

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:55.360
vore is the sexual fetish of being eaten I don't understand the issue I know you've asked me

01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:01.680
several times so you know like you're like just a toe just nibble the toe I just want you to draw

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:07.280
it all right so we already talked about the guy who made tacos out of his foot yeah we did yeah

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:15.600
we did that well is dry uh we got another question here I didn't I I wouldn't eat it and it's not

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:22.080
vegan yeah I don't know if I would eat gorilla um it seems fucked up how tasty is it that's that's

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:30.240
a good question it'd be like eating a really strong man I know oh yeah it'd be sinewy the

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:37.120
closest we can get is to like eat how tasty is it how tasty is the rock I think like a big fat

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:42.000
gorilla would taste better yeah you gotta get some like you're gonna let's move on

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.800
you gotta get some you gotta fat that gorilla

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:56.080
feed you and feed you and feed you I want to eat a girl on a diet of like old meat from walmart

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.240
that joke wasn't bad it was jane goodall

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:09.200
oh my god yeah when they bust out the walmart truck

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:20.800
oh my god it's so fucking sad all right uh we got uh damn guardian uh dom guardian on reddit asks

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:27.440
how long do you usually play for like how long are sessions two to four hours depending on if we do

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:38.720
one or two yep yeah hour and a half to yeah nailed it moving on j sake or j sake i i don't know uh

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:46.800
so joe faved one of my tweets casting the pt bp tv series good stuff which led me to click on his

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:53.680
twitter profile which leads me to the following question joe why the fuck does obama follow you

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:59.760
on twitter oh and then we had a follow-up of j-hog inc said might as well ask why britney

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:05.520
spears follows him while we're at it is that real that is real the verified accounts i checked it

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:09.840
earlier today because i'd never seen that the verified accounts of both barack obama

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:16.800
and britney spears were two early followers of joe's twitter account yeah so me and barry go way

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:23.440
back uh i introduced him to michelle and brit brit has been a fan of mine forever back when we were

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:27.760
in the tall dark and handsome she was a fan of our band uh great answer moving on wait how did

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:33.520
that actually happen though the real answer is that obama follows i think anybody who follows

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:38.560
him i i haven't checked but that's i think he's probably got a million follows also joe's just

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:44.320
assumes that but really like barack has been for like a decade like well i won't fucking joe like

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:50.960
i just want him to notice me i wish joe would dm me slide into my dms he's got 115 million followers

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:58.960
but only 600 000 follow he's only following i'm in the top 600 000 baby yeah you're a great

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:03.840
american that's pretty good uh this next question is from barry obama

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.520
and it's just the complete uh lyrics to stan

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:20.720
i was when i was in a like elementary school maybe middle school i was i had a huge huge

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.320
huge crush on britney spears so maybe she sensed that through the net and was like

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:30.400
i'll throw that kid a bone did you ever like retweet something of hers or no i mean i probably

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:35.280
follow her that's probably where the accounts crossed paths but no i don't know why she's

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.720
following me there's a really cool dude named joe terry who's friends with both of them

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:46.640
it's his dad to be honest i don't want to meet the kind of person who's friends with both

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:53.440
britney spears and barack obama they've been looking at him they've seen some

01:04:54.080 --> 01:05:01.200
dog shit i don't know man those both seem like very uh kind-hearted celebrities to follow yeah

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:07.120
britney's like leading the revolution now so i guess i should get on board uh we've got another

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:12.320
question from jay saki he says now that dennis detwiller has released an entire absolutely

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:18.480
amazing campaign around the king in yellow called impossible landscapes which starts this with the

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:24.000
scenario night floors will you get ross paton to run y'all through the whole thing pretty please

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.120
it's a wild fucking ride i think i should be the one that goes on there and none of you guys and

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:36.800
i'm just really combative the entire time with yeah i think that's a good i'd like that i won't

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:42.640
leave until it's finished but i make it as hard as the campaign yeah well frankly this town's not

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:50.400
big enough for uh for both of our podcasts so uh rppr watch your back

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:59.360
i would i would love to do that yeah that would be great i don't sounds fun yeah if ross has the

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:05.200
time that would be a huge commitment yes it would it would be really fun and really nice i absolutely

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:12.080
loved playing in uh night floors and to go back into that world would be a lot of fucking fun i

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:17.760
think that's such a cool weird scenario uh yeah i would love to love to do more of it that would be

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:25.520
super i would too super cool yeah i mean once we get the patreon up there's it's not out of the

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:31.680
realm of possibility if we hit a goal that was high enough to run a second campaign on the patreon

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:39.920
we also have to do get pins uh before we do that to give to him he was kind enough to give us all

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:47.280
enamel pins the rppr logos super cool and we got another question it's from xylopia on reddit said

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:52.720
did they ever finish the road construction work around zach's house parentheses yes we saw you on

01:06:52.720 --> 01:07:00.880
the news zach mwahaha which is horrifying docs um i was on the news uh they are doing construction

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:07.040
in front of my house it was uh i got a letter that said it would be done november of 2019

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:13.280
and it just got asphalt two days ago yeah i when i came to get all my stuff from your house i

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:27.760
drive through it no they had cones up i just literally didn't i didn't think why they would

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:33.840
have put cones up i thought some idiot left cones in the middle of the room i just stepped right in

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:42.800
and i'm like what the fuck luke ginsman valedictorian of ozark high school yeah if you google my

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:52.320
name and go to videos my speech is on there uh nice wow yeah we should maybe we can live stream

01:07:52.320 --> 01:08:00.080
and watch along yeah we can do that at the end how how long is it like it's three minutes okay

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:07.920
oh then yeah it's really bad too we got another question here uh colonel damanche colonel

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:14.720
underscore damanche colonel oh that's my bad tylenol i showed taylor clue last night she'd

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:19.840
never seen the movie clue i haven't i haven't either last night it's streaming on netflix and

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:26.800
it's an absolute delight uh this question is what does drew do in his free time he plays minecraft

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:33.280
the mouth harps yeah yeah is he a twitch streamer probably before and after the money

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:39.360
oh yeah yeah he actually what if he was like a legit twitch streamer yeah

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:45.200
he does like how-to videos on minecraft but he's like not good at all

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:51.680
oh i think drew would be really good at people just watch it to hear his voice

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:58.320
uh so maybe he is more successful than what was his uh cousin's name emmit yeah yeah the emt

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:06.800
he also i was looking at his videos the other day and uh he favorited uh he actually has a

gotta say my favorite all time is alien oh hell yeah it's such a perfect movie and then uh my

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:46.000
favorite recently is probably uh uncut gems i get a horror i consider it oh yeah man watch it again

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.080
like the first reaction you get from the movie is exactly like a great horror movie i saw it

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:58.080
three times and loved it i also before we went and saw it watched good time which is like good

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:03.120
time is awesome even crazier i still haven't seen that one it's really good it's on netflix it's on

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:09.600
my heart attack dude it's stressful he is our greatest working actor though i like honestly

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.680
believe that about this better than michael shannon yeah i think he's got more wrench oh

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:19.600
i can't wait for his batman did you see michael shannon play comedy in that christmas movie with

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:26.880
joseph he's really good and seth rogan and anthony mackie no it is it's really delicious uh justin

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:31.440
i saw that one together in theaters justin you got a favorite horror movie i don't i don't do a

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:37.600
lot of horror movies even though i'm always super interested in them uh i have trouble with the the

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:42.480
expectation of jump scares taking all the enjoyment out for me just like being like

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.880
there's probably going to be a jump scare because this camera angle is this way and it's edited this

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:51.440
way and then i just like yeah i have a lot of trouble actually getting to just sit there and

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:58.880
like get myself into it i think uh but best like horror like adjacent thing the hannibal tv show is

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:04.160
really fucked up and weird wonderful wonderful answer that's a really good answer that's so

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:10.320
good horror thing and it's really well done yeah it's like it's like is it horror it's like parts

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:15.840
of it are horror and parts are like this there's a lot of drama and it's like it's so also

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:23.680
soundtrack wise some of my favorite weird creepy soundtrack shit ever oh um actually uh i really

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:29.840
liked enemy a lot and a lot of that was soundtrack that was good it follows was like one of those

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:35.200
things though too where i i really liked it like thinking about it but watching it i just was like

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:40.000
always waiting for a jump scare and because of that i feel like it's harder for me to actually

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:45.600
just enjoy it for whatever reason if that makes any sense it's just like i'm waiting for that

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.880
noise to fuck me up instead of like focusing on the horror of what's actually happening

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:57.360
so dude i have so many horror movies in my mind i love that genre it's even the shitty ones are

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:03.840
great yeah luke showed me my favorite horror movie is my own mind man that's my favorite

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:09.040
horror picture luke one night we were hanging out and he was like have you seen drag me to hell

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:15.440
and i was like oh that one is really had a blast it was so fun uh it's like my favorite is the

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:21.600
shining like i i don't think i've seen anything that rivals that experience for me because i saw

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:29.040
a little too early and so it it's on like sixth or seventh grade and it it left a real mark

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:37.120
the scariest movie i've ever seen is sixth sense when i was 10 oh holy shit every time i went to

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:42.480
the bathroom at night same dude i was the other thing is i was like really into ghosts at the time

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:47.360
and i never thought about them being scary and like wounded and then i was convinced i was just

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:52.880
gonna see like a bloody fucking ghost like right i was like dude my mom is gonna be uh the bathroom

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.680
is at the end of this long ass dark hallway and i would just like sit at my door there was like

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:04.400
a few months when i would just like weigh if i really needed to go when i was in the second

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:10.480
grade i watched the ring and that terrified oh shit the ring is really fucking good yeah did

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:17.520
you just say second grade second grade it came out in 2002 i was in the second grade oh my god

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:22.400
you were probably in the third grade i was a super duper scaredy cat kid and horror movies

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:29.040
freaked me the fuck out to like crying hysterics and we were trying to watch uh the faculty

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:35.440
and john stewart in that movie gets all of his fingers cut off at one point and i ran screaming

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:41.280
out of the room and i was kind of like huddled in a corner and my evil sister comes running in

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:45.280
and going look my fingers are gone and she's holding down her fingers into her

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:51.040
at like she she had to have been you know six years old maybe and she was fucking with me the

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:58.480
older brother it was uh it was horrific that is exactly what i imagine your relationship with

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:05.440
your sister is still like exactly i call her in to kill the spiders for me and she tortures me

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:12.880
about it i got one more before we move on oh hit it okay the house of the devil or anything that

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:19.760
ty west directs all i've heard those are really good he did one of the in that movie vhs he did

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:27.680
one of those oh yeah yeah i would say recently mandy was like mandy's wonderful maybe not horror

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:33.680
like it's a thriller i guess technically oh it's pretty thrillers are definitely my like jam more

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.320
than horror same that's if we're doing thrillers i can run there's too many like thrillers are

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:44.000
definitely yeah the way it goes for me gotta say hereditary to hereditary i was just about to bring

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.600
up because that is like if we want to talk about like horrific movies yeah that's the scene with

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:55.600
the i'm gonna transition because i haven't seen that one yet just finally oh my god dude it's

01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:04.480
gonna fuck you up it's so much let's move on to the next one marie x lupin marie x lupin asks

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:10.480
everyone what is your favorite piece of lovecraftian media books movies comics etc

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:15.920
or is playing tabletops your main slash only exposure to the genre thomas can you please

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:20.880
start since you said that you read lovecraft earlier uh yeah in my early 20s uh i read

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.000
uh a lot of the lovecraft stories i don't know if i really had a favorite because they're kind of at

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.000
this point just like interesting historical artifacts yeah oh there's one that is not

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:40.880
lovecraft but it's from like the 1890s or something uh the willows 1907 uh by algernon

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:46.880
blackwood um it's just a really name it's just a really creepy story about like these two guys

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:53.680
going down um the daniel river like on a canoe trip anyway it's it's just really it's it was

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:59.680
really influential for like the the tone of a lot of the things we all enjoy so that's my that's my

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:04.640
out of left field answer i don't remember if it really went anywhere i remember kind of being

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:09.760
dissatisfied in the ending maybe but i i did enjoy the ride and it's just like it's got atmosphere

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:17.520
out the fucking ass um and it's not uh racist like all of lovecraft stories so that helps my

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:21.760
answer my answer actually so i haven't read a whole lot of lovecraft i think i've read maybe

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:26.000
three or four of the short stories uh but one of my favorite pieces of media is called the the

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:33.200
ballad of black tom and it's one of his stories it's the uh horror at red hook from the viewpoint

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:39.360
of his black servant in that story whoa oh that's cool i've heard it's really really good it's a

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:46.080
novella you can read it in a night it's really really well done i read really slow uh i've

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:56.160
i've never read anything by hp lovecraft i haven't either uh i know that's kind of like uh

01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:02.160
maybe fucked up but uh you should when we when we get off of here you should read like call it

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:08.800
gathulu because it's not that long and it's really cool for just the the world of like

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:14.000
unnatural horrors that it introduces and you'd understand you'd have more context to say

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:22.400
photography all the time which i do so probably my favorite lovecraftian media has got to be

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:29.280
the yellow wallpaper which i just recently brought up during one of the integral scenes

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:36.560
of the last episode of this last arc and what's cool uh for me like that story means a lot to me

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:43.680
personally uh because i once went insane and was trapped inside a room that my husband had locked

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:50.480
me in because i was anxious uh no uh so like i was obsessed with that book ever since i or the

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:56.560
since that short story ever since i read it for the first time when i was in sixth grade and then

01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:06.320
i studied english in college the first time and i read it in two other classes actually and it

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:14.000
brought it back for me and then uh turns out that the girl i was dating who then uh was also named

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:23.600
taylor and is also my wife now uh she uh that is actually her favorite short story and so she

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:29.520
teaches it in her english classes i think she finds a way to push it in there and so it's

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:35.680
always on my mind anyway love that short story it's very creepy yeah i've never read lovecraft

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:41.680
but i've seen some like movies based on his stuff um when i was a kid i didn't realize it was

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:49.680
lovecraft but i saw um from beyond it's like a 80s like kind of b movie uh but it was scary when

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:55.040
i was a kid and i remember it being good and then i recently watched color out of space with nick

01:19:55.040 --> 01:20:01.360
cage oh hell yeah that was really fun i want to that's on my list of quarantine movies i'm gonna

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:08.480
yeah it's i check out so i enjoyed it a lot um and then i recently played the uh call of cthulhu

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:15.120
game on the switch which was fun but took me like five hours to beat so not really worth the price

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:22.080
so one of my favorite lovecraft adjacent things which actually kind of got me more into it was

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:27.440
like the weird true detective season one shit where they talk about carcosa and the yellow

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:32.480
king and it's like kind of in the weird background and shit that actually was like one of the first

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:36.800
times i was like oh what is all like what's the yellow king what's this what's carco like i don't

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:42.400
i didn't really know anything before watching that and it added this weird like supernatural

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:48.560
tinge to uh what is more kind of grounded in reality and all the cultists and stuff like so

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:53.680
oh shit i'm gonna rewatch that yeah i've been thinking about it a lot lately for some reason

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:57.520
i don't know but that's mine i have actually we have a lot of time on our hands yeah

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:03.520
but yeah that's mine i actually like i'm kind of like some of the other people i haven't read any

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:07.600
lovecraft stuff i've actually been meaning to read the willows also that's on my list so when

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:12.160
thomas brought that up i was like oh someone i know actually has read this i added a bunch

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:18.320
of horror books to my to read list so i'm excited to dive into some it's a it's a good one when i

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:22.240
was i haven't done it in a few years but for a while i was really in the habit of reading like

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:27.280
our no sleep stories before bed and stuff interesting i've been doing that they're

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:32.400
perfect for it because they're like they're short they're spooky and engaging the only problem is

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:38.720
it's it just gets so hard to like find an actually good one for sure and i feel like the writer base

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:45.120
has gotten maybe younger yeah uh so there's just a lot of bad writing mistakes i literally last

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:49.680
night i hadn't been to no sleep in a long time but i just went to top of the year and started

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:54.080
reading that's always good yeah this is something i don't know if you guys have but like i said with

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:59.760
like horror movies specifically it's like prepping for that jump scare is like too much for me

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:04.800
sometimes for whatever reason i don't know if it's because i know video editing and camera work and

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:08.880
other stuff and kind of like the technical details of how they're prepping to do certain

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:12.400
things and horror stuff sometimes it's like oh they're probably going to do a jump scare and

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:17.440
then i get like more psyched out instead of like just kind of like soaking in the the ambiance or

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:23.280
whatever but reading horror does not have that effect on me at all and so i find myself when i

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:29.600
read scary stories or like a comic book or other stuff i really enjoy that and so i think i'm going

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:35.120
to start diving more because i love like the story of horror it's just the way so many horror

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:40.880
movies are shot is so jump scare heavy or you're even if it's not jump scare heavy i've been like

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:46.560
my mind is expecting it constantly so it like takes it it takes me out of it instead of like

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:52.800
just getting to like wallow in the the weirdness or whatever i get really annoyed when non-horror

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:59.360
movies have uh like set up shots over somebody's shoulder in a mirror or something yeah exactly

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:04.400
i was watching walking dead recently uh because my parents watch it and i was just kind of like

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:07.920
i was like i guess i'll hang out and watch it with you guys or whatever and it's like one of

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:12.000
those things where it's like oh there's going to be a jump scare here and almost every time

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.560
there is but it's still like it's because they always put like a stinger with audio and the other

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:21.600
stuff it always gets me because it'd be the same as like if someone just yelled at you randomly

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:27.120
out of nowhere in your everyday life you'd be like it's just like that sound and the way it's

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:33.040
usually cut and edited it always like it always works on me like it's really hard to get a good

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:38.000
one a good jump scare yeah i think they have their place for sure had my absolute favorite

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:44.560
jump scare of all time it's so fucking well done yeah everyone talked about that jump scare and i

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:48.560
didn't want to spoil it for myself but i haven't watched the series yet the whole series i loved

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:53.680
but that jump scare was it's an all-time for me it's so well done is it more of a slow burn kind

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:58.960
of horror thing or is it pretty jump scare heavy or uh both it's a slow burn because it's a series

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:03.040
yeah they have to stretch out the horror for yeah episodes or whatever it was but there are some

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:08.080
good jump scares in it but like i said they're well done like it's it's it's i think they're

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:13.520
one of my favorite ones ever yeah it's so well done it made my soul fly out of my body in such

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:20.640
a great way it took me four episodes before i was like oh yeah that's the other thing it's it does

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:24.800
take a few episodes i agree and but then it became one of my favorite it's like a really

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:30.880
good it's like a really good family drama that's also a horror thing like it's not just scary it's

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:38.000
like actually like a well-acted there's also one episode that's all one take and it's really well

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:44.480
done yeah they did a good job on that yeah that's on my list how long is that shot well so i mean

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:48.960
it's there's trickery involved but it's the episode i mean they don't cut for the whole

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:55.600
oh that's right that's right but there is one sequence that is like 12 minutes long wow where

01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:00.240
they actually like don't have yeah like oh yeah you're right you're right uh i read that on the

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:05.600
mdb trivia that like that one of their longest not actually it's super long cuts yeah it's

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:10.080
super duper long they they did a whole thing where because that the whole show takes place

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:16.560
between two time periods and they they did a camera transition between sets to do the time

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:21.600
change there's a whole behind the scenes of that episode that's so so freaking cool well and that

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:27.920
leads us into to another question about whether or not clark bishop's character uh is based on

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:35.120
jonas convolt from dark oh yeah i i would never say sure but i've never seen it i know i i didn't

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:40.320
think uh either of you had um it's actually it's pretty good it would be a good quarantine watch

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:44.720
i've heard nothing but good things about that show but the first time that i put it on i was

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:53.120
too high to read it is it is all subtitles um i heard it described as grown-up stranger things

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.120
that's a pretty good way to put it actually what about grown-ups too and stranger things

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:04.320
that would be great it is it is like so there's this time travel thing going on in this town and

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:10.000
no spoilers they i'm i won't spoil it but they set it up so it's a certain amount of years between

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.240
like time-traveling windows and they just like very like carefully do it so it avoids all of

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:22.880
the unpleasantness that happened in germany during some certain years which is a good call

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:30.960
but it's a little like interesting no nazis in this store no nazis only before and after

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:37.360
millennium hand is who asked that question by the way millennium hand german is like a really uh

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:41.440
funny language to to read the subtitles of and then like hear it

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:45.360
because the subtitles will be like are you all right and they're like das ist in ordinung

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:56.000
uh yeah no i will watch that i'm excited to watch it and then i'll steal all the

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.800
ideas to finish up clark's ark all right it's good i think taylor would really like it too

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:08.400
probably uh she's also very into this exact kind of tv we actually watched uh haunted

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:15.200
hill house haunting the heil house uh twice didn't mean to say heil so uh

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:21.760
we got a question from the quiet shouter oh my god thomas has pulled down his shirt

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:30.000
so deeply to reveal all of his chest hair and both of his nipples which he is rubbing vigorously

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:36.000
well the podcast got us these nice webcams and i've got to make a little extra money somehow so

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:41.200
i honestly have been thinking about like would i get kicked off uh

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:45.280
like a porn campsite if i just went on like with my two kittens

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:52.800
oh hey guys look at me not if your dick's out there you go probably even just like one ball

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:58.720
would be fine one ball in it that's like what i'm into just some real lance armstrong hitler shit

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:06.080
don't take it out of context but they both have one testicle all right so uh all right

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:13.840
god well you guys didn't get that from just like the thing i said well i just i don't know you

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:20.560
said heil earlier and i got all confused yeah it was like i'm really sorry zach becoming a nazi

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:28.640
i don't think so uh so quarantine does strange things to us all not that thankfully we've got

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:36.640
a question now is all right uh the fun jojo rabbit nazis dude that movie was incredible

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:43.120
we got a question from the quiet shouter who asks what is each character's favorite musical

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:50.000
drew's is the producers mine is nice wicked i don't know about keith but john lee pettymore's

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.760
is uh guys and dolls because it was the one he was in in high school yep clark's is wizard of

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:59.920
us he likes the idea of getting the courage and the brains and the heart

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:10.320
wolf the dogs would be phantom of the opera because he likes how that guy lurks around

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:17.840
in the theater all the time oh my god that's perfect a personal personal yeah he's like he's

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:25.280
like this show needs a name there luke what about keith vigna do you think he's ever seen a musical

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:30.080
probably not i mean he's seen the wizard of oz so he would probably just hop on and say that

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:38.480
i don't know how would keith vigna pronounce lay miserab he would he wouldn't try

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:46.720
less miserables exactly we've got another question from quiet shatter asks what book

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:53.040
recommendations do y'all have for the fine folks in the contention book club uh right now i'm

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:59.120
reading the plague by kamu because it seemed thematically appropriate and it's good i think

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:05.680
i'm an anarcho-syndicalist now so not really so that's nice um i've been reading a book called

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:13.920
why buddhism is true by a behavioral psychology anthropologist that's really cool as i am on my

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:20.000
mindfulness bullshit basically talking about how like the teachings of buddhism are like actually

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.920
still ringing true in modern psychology and how they apply to humans as we have evolved from

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:30.800
living in villages and stuff but we still like freak out over the same things that we've always

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:37.840
freaked out over because our brains aren't that much evolved from those past times it is a very

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:42.400
cool book and he's very funny that's he's very funny otherwise it would not be fun to read

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:48.480
i would recommend house of leaves i always loved that and any fan of this podcast would probably

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:54.720
find something to like in it uh and then also the next question is from uh the modest light

01:30:54.720 --> 01:31:01.200
who brings up uh john dies at the end which is uh i love that book too and a fan of this podcast

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:06.640
would also find a lot to enjoy in there if you've found that um you don't read as much as you once

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:11.920
did or would like to because of the internet or just the world or whatever i just read uh

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:16.960
kitchen confidential by anthony bordain and it's you know it's a book i'd always heard about

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:21.920
uh but it was really entertaining it's a really quick read and it like really helped put that

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:26.240
reading habit back into my life and it became a lot easier after like having a book that i

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:30.240
could just that was like a page turner that i could just scorch through to like make time to

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:38.000
read each day now that's awesome so so did living in quarantine uh real quick to give a suggestion

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:44.240
for a book uh for the contention book club would just be uh Dianetics the modern science of

01:31:47.200 --> 01:32:01.920
it oh no and all your people here you're tremendous except the people in the left

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:09.440
when you're smoking on a big ass i think i'll probably read john dies at the end because

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:16.000
i've seen the movie like five times over the past many years and like the movie it's

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:22.160
did you like it are you so you've seen it many times because you like it yeah so i it it's the

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:28.480
weirdest thing that that movie starts out so perfectly stuck to the book like the first act

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:33.760
is is verbatim from the book and then it goes really wild at the end i wonder if they ran out

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:38.880
of budget or something it it really screws with the story and it leaves out a huge chunk that's

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:45.120
like a whole like arc in the book it's it's really wild how crazy that movie went i'm really glad

01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:52.480
that i didn't read it first then yeah because like it was fun i have not seen the movie or read the

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:59.440
book but i should so far in quarantine i went back and read uh cat's cradle again i anything

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:06.720
Vonnegut is always good yes read breakfast of champions and then i read uh the time machine by

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:13.920
hg wells it's really short and fun and then i've been reading a lot of Cormac McCarthy books so i

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:20.560
read uh shit i forgot the name of one of them uh child of god was interesting it's pretty short too

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:27.440
uh and i'm reading blood meridian right now and it's very violent and it's still cool i really

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:33.040
like uh douglas adams i think that's probably i haven't read john dies at the end but i'm guessing

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:38.560
that my favorite book by him uh which is dirk gently's holistic detective agency

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:46.160
probably has a super super fun yeah probably has a similar vibe i don't know also that was a

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:52.000
crazy tv series uh i don't know if you guys saw my list it's on hulu right now what is it

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:59.040
two seasons of very fun television with elijah wood if i'm not mistaken it is elijah wood indeed

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:07.840
uh really fucking silly and very very fun anon a no-no asks okay i've got a real scandalous one

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:15.920
kiss marry kill past present future i love kiss give a little yeah kisses give a little smooch

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:24.080
brother yeah you gotta you gotta kill your past gotta kill your past kill the past kiss the

01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:29.120
present marry the future boom yeah that's mine for sure no i think you gotta kiss the future

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:33.920
you gotta marry the present you gotta marry the present you gotta be grounded in that present

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:38.880
baby but but without without completely killing the possibility of the future you want to give

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:45.040
it a smooch you have to look forward to it with a gentle smooch but yeah sometimes a kiss can lead

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:54.880
to the future but uh right now my present is uh is coronavirus lockdown so i would kill it

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:59.120
i would kill it to do anything to the future

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:07.600
whatever you want future i'll do whatever you need baby whatever yeah to ride this wave uh

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:13.680
i've got some great news uh i mentioned last week's uh on last week's episode that my dad

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:19.920
uh went in and got tested for covid and his test came back negative

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.760
yeah

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:30.880
two days later his fever broke and he's feeling no symptoms and my mom has not gotten sick or gotten

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:37.840
any symptoms but they're both still doing a full 14-day quarantine to make sure and i am proud of

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:43.520
them both and super happy that they don't hopefully have it because it could be a false negative but

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:48.560
hopefully not yeah so it's wild how much the symptoms mirrored it and then to yeah be negative

01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:55.280
that's awesome dude it's also wild some of the like false the like the tests are kind of bad

01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:59.840
especially depending on where they came from like some of them fail up to like 30% of the time

01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:01.920
so yeah but your mom's fine probably

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:10.480
zach oh he was frozen i see i thought he was oh yeah i did too

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:15.120
did someone say something mean about my dad

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:23.520
nobody said anything about but the truth about your about your shitty fucking dad

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.160
denny denny is amazing maybe one of the best people

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:37.600
to have ever existed he's a good one uh hey question joe yo do do we need to wrap this

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:43.920
thing up oh no i can keep going okay i assume everyone else is on a uh similar sleep schedule

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:52.320
to me so let's keep pushing yes yeah yeah okay sorry not asking a question no sorry

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:59.040
when my statements are supposed to be questions um just so forceful we got a question from

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:06.480
at snuggles mcsquigg nice does each cast member have a favorite character they'd

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:10.960
created for a past campaign they wish they could bring into a new one oh yeah

01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:18.560
yeah yeah for sure doctor dr denny denison i really hope makes an appearance at some point

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:25.120
dr denny denison was great that was a character he was a cult surgeon yeah he was a doctor surgeon

01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:32.320
for a cult uh i think i got kicked out of it you did get kicked out of it uh i don't remember how

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:38.720
he was just nasty and gross he was always trying to collect bodies yeah he developed a poop fetish

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:46.160
at one point he sounds like a joy that was fun that one so yeah luke literally when i gave him

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:52.560
that fetish uh just ran with it he stood up and he said okay i'm gonna play this out i'll be right

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:58.320
back and he walked out of the room and we all sat there and then he walked back in and he set up a

01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:05.200
chair as the toilet which is like he got this fetish from like finding a clue inside a toilet

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:13.040
that was filled with shit he found it in a turd right yeah and then like as he found it like a

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:21.440
bunch of the brood worm yeah like yeah like came out of the the the fecal matter as well and so

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:28.640
he acted out like charade style him with this chair as the toilet and then him acting out the

01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:34.480
entire scene of pulling out and all the facial expressions to come with it and that's when i knew

01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:43.600
that i was in a very good fun role-playing group yeah so that's that's mine miss him forever i

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:49.280
have three actually from like three really different i'm fucking sorry joe but if you

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:54.800
can show the fuck yes joe some of us take role-playing seriously and i know you don't

01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:03.600
i've looked at joe's notes and it's just he just writes penis over and over again with diagrams

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:09.200
that's true you're really good at drawing all my plots just spent all his time role-playing

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:15.600
just trying to imagine what each character's penis looks like that's my style baby that's

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:23.120
the most excited thing like he's not listening to anything zach says except except for how it

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:29.280
might inform what like the dude's fucking junk looks like it's like describe this squamous tube

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:35.840
monster how confident is how confident is this guy what's his walk look like

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:41.920
i can tell you very confidently confidence has nothing to do with size

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:55.120
um no uh we talked about the scion campaign before i uh really loved my guy who uh killed

01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:02.480
saddam hussein and he was a curt he was a curtish rebel he was really fun to play as because he had

01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:07.520
a bunch of like weird skills and was like kind of a weird character to be with all those other

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:14.560
i mean in scion everyone's kind of but he had a lot of guns and knives and swords yeah which

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:21.920
was fun in a weird like magical god thing to be like yeah i have a fucking gun though and then uh

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:28.320
from the patreon episode i really loved my guy who had the little tiny teleporting cat

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:34.560
in his pocket yeah agent wolf i actually really liked him and uh more i just liked that he had

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:40.480
a little teleporting cat that lived in his like dress shirt pocket and then in one of my dnd

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:46.560
campaigns where i first got introduced to role-playing i had a weird minotaur blacksmith

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:52.880
character who had a big hammer and one of my other friends was a dragon person or whatever

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:58.240
i don't there's they're called dragon born is it okay he was a dragonborn or wait is that

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:06.880
no it might be i think it's dragonborn it's both right yeah yeah um but he uh our dm let us do a

01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:12.400
combo attack where he would heat up my hammer as though i was gonna do some sick ass blacksmith

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:18.240
shit with it and then like bash people away and he also had a bunch of grappling moves so he's

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:23.440
just like hitting people with this huge hammer that's almost like melted while like suplexing

01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:30.400
other dnt characters so that's really fun he was very fun character that you had on the same

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:36.720
patreon episode as agent wolf yeah it's one of my favorite characters that we've had on the show

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:44.000
oh thank you i liked him too he was uh he was uh he was psycho he was unfeeling

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:49.840
clark is definitely my favorite character i've ever played but i also really liked

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:53.360
the first time i ever played with you guys i had a character named stacy bloom

01:41:54.240 --> 01:42:00.480
and he was a wide-eyed new kid on in law enforcement let alone delta green so i it was i

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:06.400
was able to play my own real reactions to feeling you guys out about how to play this

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.920
new game i've never played before i could do it through the guys of this wide-eyed new character

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:19.840
and to give uh listeners an idea of what stacy bloom walked into uh he joined right after the

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:26.000
other players had just run through last things last into the shotgun scenario metamorphosis

01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.600
so uh last things last is the one we were talking about earlier and then metamorphosis

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:38.480
is a shotgun scenario for delta green and those two pair very very well and then joe came in and

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:45.520
they were all explaining what happened uh in the last session and his eyes were fucking massive

01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:52.480
it was quite the world to be thrown into you yeah thomas thomas i would i would agree with

01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:56.400
joe that john lee pettymore is probably the favorite my favorite character i've ever played

01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:06.000
um but uh that same scion game justin was talking about uh i played a david bowie inspired superhero

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:14.080
named aladdin sane uh who was like a legitimate pop star and uh in the world so i got to like make

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:20.320
up dumb little songs and stuff can you give us a taste it was so fun yeah the one we all the the

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:26.960
one people seem to remember the best one it was yeah we were playing this game at christmas time

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:31.600
so i was talking about like the profits from my from my numerous christmas albums and i brought

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:37.360
up the song christmas time in london town they're like well how does that go and it goes it's

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:46.800
christmas time in london town the skies are gray and the streets are brown the streets are brown

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:49.360
the streets are brown we all just kind of looked at it

01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:59.280
that was a really fun campaign and then my very first dnd character was uh an era kokra which is

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:08.400
a bird person oh yeah i named myself harvey birdman and uh my two uh would be my pathfinder

01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:13.600
character and the only game of pathfinder i played uh for like two or three sessions before i bailed

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:17.040
because we started making this podcast and i didn't have time for literally anything else

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:26.800
in my life ever again was his name was alexander iman and he was a bard halfling and his name was

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:37.680
alexander iman and if you shortened it his name was alex seaman yeah uh yep i think that got a

01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:48.320
yeah from luke like yeah uh-oh it took andy way longer to realize that i mean as soon as i heard

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:54.160
it i was like yeah that's dope yeah the other players and the gm didn't realize until the

01:44:54.160 --> 01:45:00.880
third or fourth session uh after which i andy andy's a sweet boy i stole all their gold and

01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:09.280
i left to go try to save my sister and ended up giving a virus like a disease to an entire town

01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:16.880
down river so uh yeah the other one was uh i really liked the delta green shotgun scenario

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:26.160
burner uh that ross paton wrote uh i played a brolo named brody and uh there was a fun

01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:34.240
scene in that one where i got to um uh you know make a bunch of molotov cocktails and bust open

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:43.040
the doors of a saloon while blasting eye of the tiger and i had taken like the grime from the

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:49.680
floor of the bar and like rubbed it underneath my eyes to to become a warrior and then i died

01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:55.120
that uh that is still one of the most fun uh sessions i've ever played in and your actions

01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:01.360
in it like opened up the insane possibilities of role-playing for me i'd never played delta green

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:06.800
and you were like so confident as like you're we we played all these people who came together when

01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:11.440
like shit hits the fan at this strip mall and i think you were just like the teenager who worked

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:16.800
at a cell phone store right yeah and you were just like really confidently like playing with

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:21.360
the world and what you were allowed to do and i was like oh that's dope thank you i hated a

01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:27.280
bathroom and posted on reddit a bunch at the beginning yeah you like it was like what's zach

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:30.960
doing and he's like yeah i'm just on my phone in the bathroom but then you were also like you had

01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:35.040
snuck into the bar and you made the molotovs without us like really knowing i was just passing

01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:39.840
sam notes and he was having me do like secret checks and then like he basically passed me a

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:43.920
note that was like all right narrate your cool scene of you like coming out of the bar with all

01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:52.240
your molotovs and um yeah molotovs didn't help uh the shotgun that i didn't have ammo for didn't

01:46:52.240 --> 01:47:01.360
help it was the fact that we all got real shit face didn't help yeah and there were like seven

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:08.160
players at the table and two people were sharing one player yeah that was wild that was wild god

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:16.880
bless sam all right uh very very much so yeah uh anyone else have any players i think that's it

01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:23.920
all right cool uh so they actually had another question snuggles mcsquig asked are there any

01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:29.920
other systems anyone is interested in trying something like never going home which is a world

01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:36.160
war one kathulu rpg with beautiful art well i've never heard of it until now but yeah that sounds

01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:41.360
dope as i've said before love to get more into dungeon world and really learn that system a

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:46.560
little bit better i have the book the book is also very cool and fun to read i've been really wanting

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:52.880
to get into uh like super stripped down rpg stuff uh sam actually ran us that weird like homebrew

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:57.520
thing where it was like the most stripped down ever i'd like to go like a couple steps above

01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:04.480
that where it's like yeah there's a thing called uh risus or r-i-s-u-s it's free on the internet

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:10.720
uh people said it's a really good introductory way to do role-playing stuff uh just in case

01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:17.200
anyone else was looking for that like i was a couple days ago is this the anything rpg

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:24.080
oh risus is latin for laughter it's uh i think it's just like a very like bare bones like you

01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:28.960
can kind of apply it to whatever stuff you want it to be which sounds really interesting to me

01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:33.680
i kind of like that like zach said i kind of what can i do that like i want to do like cooperative

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:39.920
storytelling more than like gameplay functionality it's like we can play a video game together if we

01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:46.800
really want to get down into that stuff but i'd rather have like the just a a loose set of rules

01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:51.520
to guide a story it's kind of what i like there's a lot of like single page rpgs that i'd love to

01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:58.960
play i'll do whatever zach runs same yeah i've always really wanted to play like a long-term

01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:04.320
sci-fi campaign uh same like the star wars one or something no no i really wouldn't want it to be

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:10.400
like in a star wars world just i got you bigs but like yeah having fun in a space opera setting

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:16.160
would be dope this is one that i would be interested in if zach would run it no stop

01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:24.880
sharing screenshots and it ruined ugo rpg does what exists anybody has a ugo rpg

01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:33.040
boy howdy i've been wanting to play in a deadlands it's the weird west one it sounds like it'd be

01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:40.000
super cool super cool dope did you guys uh did you guys listen to dad lands i did adventure time

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:47.040
live episode oh yeah i did yeah it's super funny wait oh gotcha yes that was really adventure zone

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:53.600
none of them yeah so i got super confused oh in adventure time rpg would be fun as fuck i bet

01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:58.400
there is one oh i'm a big star trek nerd i'd love to play the star trek role-playing game

01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:04.240
apparently it's super cool because you have like your character but also you have like ship traits

01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:09.200
that when you're on the ship like you have maneuver it and stuff it looks super cool that's

01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:12.800
exactly the kind of thing i want to play where we're like the crew of a spaceship going yeah

01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:21.120
different like well instead of that uh what we are probably gonna play soon is someone made a

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:24.400
play set for fiasco based on tiger king

01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:39.760
i just sent a message uh there is an adventure time uh tabletop rpg and this is the entire set

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:47.680
of rules and everything so that'd be fun very fun uh we've got another question here from dazed

01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:53.840
underscore wanderer asks one what the fuck zach spelled my name wrong so

01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:00.960
what the fuck dazed underscore wanderer back at you number two uh was everything

01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:04.400
in the storage lockers k-cells hmm

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:07.680
hmm

01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:18.720
interesting uh so next week or basically here's what i'm thinking is uh i would like to do another

01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:26.240
q a that is a plot q a where we can talk about like things that the characters have learned

01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:31.200
and connecting some of those dots together let's give the people what they want more q a's

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:43.040
so i think now is a really good time to uh get the plot like ironed out and have you guys ready

01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:52.480
to um head into the next arc of this story uh so we will answer that question on that episode

01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:58.800
number three how's ropo they still on that grind to lose weight they are i feed them less than

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:06.400
you're supposed to you're the correct amount for a diet and then they they chase each other around

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:11.440
uh so i'm hoping that's what does it any fitness tips from you guys yeah get ropo hitting the

01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:18.160

01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:23.120

film it and send it to me privately my my personal what do you want me to wear my personal

01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:34.480

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:18.720
12 our beloved chuckling boy asks if the next campaign you played could not be in the kathulu

01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:26.640
family of game systems rude dg csc pulp trail etc what would it be and why is it red markets

01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:33.280
i don't know what red markets is but let's do that one yeah red markets is apparently

01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:40.080
chuckling boy it's good enough for me i've heard only great things and i know ross paton

01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:46.560
is really into it which would make sense because it's written by caleb stokes who lives around here

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:54.240
and is on rpr rppr a fair amount and wrote a really he also wrote a really dope campaign

01:53:54.240 --> 01:54:01.040
called god's teeth that he ran on rppr that is being published currently are being worked on

01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:07.680
to be published by delta green currently and yeah red markets is basically a survival game

01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:14.400
where you are in a zombied world but then your supplies run low and you have to go out on

01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:21.040
missions and like the more intense the mission is the better like rewards are available on that you

01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:27.680
know and basically you're trying to survive and make a world for yourself so the description is

01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:35.120
really interesting online uh red markets a game of economic horror yes uh and red markets characters

01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:39.280
risk their lives trading between the massive quarantine zones containing a zombie outbreak

01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:45.360
in the remains of civilization that sounds markets uses the traditional uh zombie genre

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:50.880
to tell its story about surviving on the wrong end of the economy weird sounds that sounds really

01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:57.120
interesting that sounds close yeah that sounds dope thanks for the tip chuckling boy i hit up

01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:03.840
caleb on twitter and asked if he would run god's teeth for us when it and he said when it's

01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:12.000
published he will so that's fucking sick uh maybe he'll ride run some red markets for us before then

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:17.360
seeing as how he's the dude who wrote it i've seen him stream shit i bet he can do it remotely

01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:23.440
that'd be cool uh he also asked uh chuckling boy asked what is a question that you were surprised

01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:28.880
no one has asked i can answer this literally anything about the campaign i don't know why

01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:33.520
people don't ask questions about the story stuff it always surprises me it feels like

01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:38.080
the people on the subreddit have a much stronger grasp of the campaign than us so

01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:46.560
yeah they they don't need any questions yeah they know what's going on i don't understand why you

01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:54.560
guys don't can we do a q a where we get the cues you guys ask the questions and then the chat

01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:03.600
answers them yeah there you go so sad uh should the should the air uh light be on on my focus

01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:10.720
right yeah uh i think joe got you to turn it on before we started he totally pranked you because

01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:19.680
now you sound like you've been sucking in helium the entire time oh no great break though uh we

01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:27.680
got another question here from gwen egr and they ask how do you like to transition between

01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:33.920
campaigns do you prefer to build off an old thread or create something brand new create something

01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:40.240
brand new every time i think that especially in delta green most of the games i think all the

01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:47.440
campaigns that we've played in end with at least some sort of impact that would leave the globe

01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:53.520
reeling and therefore if we were to start another campaign in that same world the impact of the

01:56:53.520 --> 01:57:00.480
previous campaign would be evident and therefore i prefer to have a clean slate yeah in the uh

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:05.920
in the two previous like mega campaigns we've done with you uh we did not

01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:14.960
save things you put it off you put it off for a long time we tried

01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:20.480
we did our best that's all anyone could have expected from us i think we mostly go insane

01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:27.840
or die and and then the world ends yeah whose character like got killed and then came back

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:35.040
alive and killed over and over again that was thomas's professor character was trapped in a room

01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:39.520
it wasn't that you died though right it was that you had to watch your wife die over and over again

01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:47.920
wasn't that the thing yeah he had to watch a film of him performing a spell on his wife who had

01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:54.640
cancer trying to cure her and fucking up the spell and killing her and he had to

01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:58.960
watch that on repeat infinitely super fun do you remember her name

01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:12.160
times elizabeth uh yeah i believe uh the great old lord cthulhu came on up out of the ocean

01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:16.800
at the end of that campaign and stared joe's character right in the eyes we blinked at each

01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:20.000
other it's cute it's a meet cute

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.880
oh you come to this beach too cthulhu dropped something on the beach and you guys bonk heads

01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:36.640
for talking you talk funny bud

01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:40.560
but i think you're so cute

01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:48.640
uh we got another question this is uh oh man ain't on a no-no you've really truly

01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:54.160
outdone yourself here if you were stranded on a dessert island what kind of sentient

01:58:54.240 --> 01:59:02.240
confectionary treats would you hunt for survival gummy bears oh that'd be a truly horrifying one

01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:07.680
they're full they're full-sized like they're bear-sized

01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:14.800
yep uh yeah joe took the good animal and i would hunt whatever was brownies

01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:17.600
so

01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:27.920
and you know if they if they happen to like get like warm by being chased then maybe

01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:33.440
chase them around like directly toward the vanilla ice cream fountain or something like

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:40.480
god stop zach and uh and then that's all that's all i need for a perfect dessert uh you know if

01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:47.600
you want to drop a double shot of espresso on top of that be it since you're not um stop it

01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:57.360
i forgot to have one uh whatever weird critter i want like a turtle made out of chocolate chip

01:59:57.360 --> 02:00:04.400
cookies but his body is like a hershey's chocolate turtle body but his shell is a big chocolate chip

02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:10.720
cookie yeah i get you cut him i can like split him right down the half in front of his turtle

02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:21.920
family crack him open that yeah that's a good answer i want to hunt down uh a moose that is

02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:29.920
darker than dark and squeamish like oil and it writhes about in the air and i just like moose

02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:36.160
i like moose and pudding a lot i could do something like that uh would be good for me on

02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:40.720
an island you're a little pudding boy oh dude when the sun's out i've got to have my pudding

02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:50.960
i haven't had a a dessert pizza in like a decade yeah the godfather's m&m pizza is like the

02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:57.760
godfather's m&m pizza was so good i want one right now herman cain baby oh i forgot herman

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:07.120
started oh yeah was he the cigarette smoking ad um he was he was the stare and smile uh the stare

02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:11.520
and smile he might have also been the cigarette ad i don't remember oh what a character i want

02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:21.360
andy's that's andy's uh custard that's my answer just but what animal would it be would you have

02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:26.560
brutally kill while you i would be i would be stranded there with andy and

02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:31.760
i would force him to make me custard

02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:39.280
actually you guys have seen you guys have been to andy's you have to watch the the custard

02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:46.080
come the chocolate comes out it looks like and um and that's the joke yeah i get a brownie

02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:52.640
that's a fresh idea i get a stolen brownie pecan concrete every time oh no i got an idea you have

02:01:52.640 --> 02:02:01.120
to suck the custard out of zach's weird chocolate moose moose out of his bunghole i was thinking

02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:08.320
like oh teats no it's out of its butt because we said it looked like poop wow now we agreed to it

02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:19.840
all right uh i don't like this island so holy shit a pigeon well yeah fantastic name asks which

02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:26.960
player character has the nicest butt i think it's john lee pettymore i think i think canonically it

02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:32.240
is i think that in one of the early episodes you said that he has a magnificent ass he's got a

02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:38.080
tight ass he wears he wears two tight jeans yeah yeah in a good way to people like it

02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:44.320
holy shit a pigeon also asks who would you pick to play your characters and npc's if pt bp

02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:51.520
was a live action movie or show we are going to take our time with that question on the next

02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:58.320
episode how about that uh it was all a snow globe asks how much of the story right yeah that's fun

02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:04.080
uh how much the story writing process is influenced by slash influences the song you've

02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:08.880
chosen for the intros do you typically find that music influences you're writing a lot

02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:15.920
yes it absolutely does i remember specifically writing the plot for the silver spheres when

02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:20.240
i realized that john lee pettymore was the only one who had picked it up and then he put it in

02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:26.960
his pocket and i said okay well those balls have to do something weird and then i was like okay

02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:33.040
well why is john lee pettymore allowed to touch it if no one else is and no backbone was a part

02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:37.360
of that like when i was coming up with like the idea for that i was like oh shit this is this is

02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:45.280
perfect uh so literally that song made thomas's character's entire arc essentially nice super

02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:54.240
cool the theme song's about me guys uh and then when i was picking out the other songs

02:03:54.960 --> 02:04:01.680
yeah i find the lyrics like extremely important especially like uh moon dance i knew i knew what

02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:09.440
i was looking for plot wise uh for that arc before i got the song picked out but uh when

02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:14.640
that song happened when i came across it i was like oh yes of course this is absolutely perfect

02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:20.480
and then the next one this most recent one where we had dream girl uh that actually influenced the

02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:28.080
plot as well once i decided on that one uh that actually probably helped change joe's entire plot

02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:36.240
uh for that the line uh i swear i knew you before this yep yeah and then she says uh corner room

02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:44.560
and it was right so the room has no corners which is an allusion to a circle the hounds of tenderloose

02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:53.520
which is some nerd shit and a circle um okay moving on uh so a lot a lot and always and it

02:04:53.520 --> 02:05:00.720
always matters so uh ain't on a no-no once again how much filth could have wolf ah fuck i fucked

02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:05.200
it up how much felt could a wolf wolf down if a wolf could wolf down filth well done

02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:10.320
uh justin why are you asking me and moving on we've got

02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:11.360
a question

02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:23.920
lord dairy is wrong with you guys uh d-a-r-r-y lord dairy asks is jeremy pettymore still alive

02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:32.640
no right like no like no no like no he dead john lee pettymore shot him in the head

02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:39.920
yeah i answered uh one of my favorite moments from this podcast that ending to that was so

02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:46.640
fucking well done i had not planned that in any way and when thomas and i were role playing it it

02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:55.440
just fucking happened and i was on the edge of my seat with what he was going to do next and with

02:05:55.440 --> 02:06:00.640
what happened i was just so fucking so that's one of those moments in role playing where you just

02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:07.920
it's three eighths of a sneeze three eighths of a sneeze three sneezes

02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:11.760
three eighths of a sneeze is so much less

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:22.400
guys sneezing is so much better than role playing i swear uh so at ripsaw underscore unicorn applied

02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:29.200
with uh pet pics and a question uh those pets were very adorable and they ask a question that

02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:35.680
i cannot answer what anime tropes do y'all feel each player character would fall into you know

02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:42.480
how in some anime in some animes uh like they're in a fight and they keep revealing more and more

02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:46.720
powers and they're like getting stronger and stronger keith would be like the opposite of

02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:51.920
that where he just keeps doing stupider and stupider and stupider so keith keith would be

02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:56.000
like the anime character who just like is constantly eating all the time and that's

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:04.880
their only like yeah that's the brad pitt anime john lee pettymore is not an anime trope is is

02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:10.560
the best way i can put it everybody who's he's just not serious enough as a person

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:15.920
in the way that everyone in fucking anime is about every little fucking thing they do

02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:21.920
whoa wow such harsh language it's just uh it's just a little theatrical for me

02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:30.080
that's weird plus like plus i can't uh yeah i don't know i love theater clark bishops would

02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:39.680
be having huge titties yeah clark bishop yeah got them anime titties dig it

02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:47.040
i i don't watch like any anime so i will defer to you guys on what my trope would be i don't

02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:51.760
know what anime tropes there are i feel like a lot of our characters don't obey a lot of traditional

02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:59.200
anime tropes generally it's tonally so not that john lee pettymore i feel like is like the badass

02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:04.800
character that a lot of animes have yeah but that that badass character is always like has

02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:11.600
this dark past that they're like trying to atone for or like get revenge for or something yeah

02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:18.000
and john lee pettymore is just here to fucking ride wild yeah pretty much he just wants to now

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:23.520
that he has five million dollars yeah he's just a dude running around in his dad's body

02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:33.040
that'll animate i am my dad like john lee pettymore looks down he's looking at a dick

02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:42.000
that's fucked his mom that's cool wow nice holy shit clark has the like dead parents anime trope

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:48.320
oh that is true yeah you're the protagonist of every anime he's also the protagonist in this

02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:50.160
he's also the protagonist of the story

02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:55.920
okay that's my that's if that's true then why do i have the theme song the theme song is about

02:08:55.920 --> 02:09:05.920
thomas but the story is about joe and luke is uh keith is there there scraping by you're all

02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:12.080
very important i hope you know that uh so we've got another one here from at stories colossal

02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:18.640
says if you guys were playing with bonds in the main timeline bonds is a mechanic in delta green

02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:26.400
where uh you lose and gain a good relationship with three or four different people two to four

02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:32.160
different people in your life and you can like basically your sanity uh is affected

02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:38.240
or affects those relationships so who would they be for each of the pcs uh we started to

02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:43.600
touch on it i think in one episode and we i decided that clark is a real sad lonely guy

02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:49.920
so his bonds would be like the checkout guy at the grocery store who is in a dream of yours yep

02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:56.400
and uh probably maggie if if that was a thing that you could do have a bond with somebody who

02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:01.680
isn't in the story much totally like that would be definitely one of his bonds when we were thinking

02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:06.400
about maybe even having pawns i think as a mechanic i think john lee pettymore was going

02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:13.280
to use just the extended pettymore family as a bond and then like as as he called on them to do

02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:18.240
different things obviously that relationship would get strained as more of them were like taken by

02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:24.000
supernatural horrors but but thinking about it now john lee pettymore definitely has like an

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:29.760
ex-girlfriend who got tired of his shit but still cares for him that like if shit really went down

02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:34.640
he could be like shit like fuck and call her but she definitely doesn't want to be a part of his

02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:42.800
life on a day-to-day basis anymore oh for keith uh he's never dated anybody he killed his brother

02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:51.520
doesn't have much family to speak of so his one and only bond would be no spoilers

02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:56.320
i mean if they're listening to this they just listen to everything else i'm kidding

02:10:56.320 --> 02:11:03.600
uh so it would be bean my dog uh which leads us into the last question which is a very good

02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:11.680
question and it was brought up on the discord uh pretty recently and crush posted in the uh

02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:20.480
in the question thread what happened to keith's dog and then uh bx borei 9181 who is currently

02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:27.360
doing a re-listen while taking notes and posting the notes in the subreddit which is dope uh very

02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:32.960
cool and fun to fun to watch uh i think she might have even been the one who posted it in the

02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:38.640
discord but anyway uh she said also if keith was in the city before coming home to contention

02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:45.360
how did he miss all those dirty dog grooming locations especially since he had a dog um okay

02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:52.640
so what happened to keith's dog he is happily at at home in the motel hotel motel i'm sure

02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:59.120
it's only been a couple days he can fend for himself it's been five days yep yeah what if

02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:05.120
what if like uh maybe he was running around in the creek bed having fun with all the other dogs

02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:12.480
okay so guys he probably tore into that dead in a hotel room no he torn in my big bag of dog food

02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:19.200
and then chewed his way out of the hotel room and is swimming with the fishes

02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:26.080
and his and his stomach burst because of all the food he ate and now he's dead

02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:30.800
no he's alive i would hope we haven't been to contention in a while so i've got to check on

02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:40.400
him he should call him come here bean what do you guys think about playing animals in contention

02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:51.120
for like uh one hour one shot you guys play animals in contention who have to save bean from

02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:57.440
the room that he's locked in in hotel motel the stakes are simply too high uh

02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:05.520
the emotional devastation if we didn't like yeah if we didn't save beans and also it's not one hour

02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:13.120
it's an entire campaign also we're starting it now and it's as long as the quarantine is

02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:18.720
and if you go to sleep i'll come over to your house and kill you

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:28.720
what uh yeah you know you gotta keep playing continually yeah you can never stop oh no

02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:36.080
never stop never stopping bro uh so i will come up with a like uh you said you will come

02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:45.200
and i only speak the truth uh right and you guys will play different animals who are in contention

02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:55.120
