00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
Welcome y'all to the most rip-roaring radio show in contention.

00:04.800 --> 00:09.020
It's your friendly neighborhood DJ, Wolf the dog.

00:09.020 --> 00:14.800
We are broadcasting live and uncut from 694.2 PTBP.

00:14.800 --> 00:19.760
Welcome to one of only two segments on this show, Howlin' with Wolf.

00:19.760 --> 00:25.040
This listener wrote, hey Wolf, just wanna give a shout out to all my amazing DM Joe

00:25.040 --> 00:31.320
and my swashbuckling comrades Opus, Dick Buggsley and Wingapo.

00:31.320 --> 00:36.480
We have survived pirates, shark people and hurricanes raining blood and I wouldn't have

00:36.480 --> 00:38.920
wanted to go through it with anyone else.

00:38.920 --> 00:43.360
Thanks for a great adventure, love Blythe.

00:43.360 --> 00:49.240
You know, that was real sweet, except for that part about shark people and bloody precipitation.

00:49.240 --> 00:53.240
That sounds nasty, Wolf the dog kinda nasty.

00:53.240 --> 00:58.360
Your old buddy Wolf wants to hear all about your nasty, go ahead and submit a 5 star review

00:58.360 --> 01:04.100
on your podcast app, screenshot that shit and send it to us or tag us on social media

01:04.100 --> 01:09.960
at pretendingpod on instagram and twitter, pretending to be people of facebook.

01:09.960 --> 01:15.560
Now speaking of blood filled hurricanes, I'm about to make it rain some news on y'all.

01:15.560 --> 01:20.800
Officers Bishop and Pettymore headed to the suburbs to chat with Dr. Marie Jacobs when

01:20.800 --> 01:25.040
they saw an unkempt man frantically vacuuming his lawn.

01:25.040 --> 01:30.560
There are two more paragraphs here but they have been crossed out with a very, very thick

01:30.560 --> 01:31.560
sharpie.

01:31.560 --> 01:37.720
Our brave and heroic contingent police officer Keith Vigna was made unconscious by Billy

01:37.720 --> 01:44.240
Harrison, the man found tied up in the trunk of Charles Donovan, the drunk who threatened

01:44.240 --> 01:46.000
the woman at Forgotten Treasures.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.840
Both of these cats have told officers that they are friends of John Peters.

01:51.840 --> 01:57.160
Now speaking of cats, Dr. Marie Jacobs seems to be up to no good y'all.

01:57.160 --> 02:02.240
Officers Bishop and Pettymore found man sized fecal matter in the litter box and then doctor

02:02.240 --> 02:08.440
yelled Salem, prompting something to begin running up the stairs from the basement.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.720
Y'all ever take a shit in your cat's litter box?

02:38.440 --> 02:59.440
Keith, you wake up wearing a thin gown and both of your wrists have been handcuffed to

02:59.440 --> 03:01.880
the sides of the hospital bed that you are in.

03:01.880 --> 03:07.120
Billy Harrison, your uniform and your gear are nowhere to be seen.

03:07.120 --> 03:12.520
However, the door to this room is now open and a decent amount of the clinic staff is

03:12.520 --> 03:14.720
standing around outside it.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.960
Some of them are pointing their phones at you.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.280
All of them are laughing.

03:19.280 --> 03:25.520
Some more subtly than others, you overhear a few phrases like, no wonder William was

03:25.520 --> 03:30.240
so embarrassed by him and oh, isn't that, isn't that Keith Beans?

03:30.240 --> 03:32.300
What's he calling himself now?

03:32.300 --> 03:36.920
And they notice you wake up and awkwardly shuffle about as a young woman comes into

03:36.920 --> 03:42.360
the room with bolt cutters and breaks the links on your cuffs, leaving you with a pair

03:42.360 --> 03:44.760
of nice iron bracelets.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.240
And she says, ignore them, a bunch of gossip hounds.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.520
Are you okay?

03:49.520 --> 03:50.960
What the hell happened?

03:50.960 --> 03:52.720
We're not entirely sure.

03:52.720 --> 03:56.960
It seems that you may have been unconscious for, for some time.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.360
Have you found, where's Billy Harrison at?

03:59.360 --> 04:04.480
The man that you came in with is no longer here.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.520
No one has seen him.

04:06.520 --> 04:10.040
Well, I gotta, I gotta get going.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.040
Okay.

04:11.040 --> 04:17.440
I want to see if I can see security footage to see where he went off to or how he got away.

04:17.440 --> 04:22.640
You can go check and she'll take you to go look at the security footage in the clinic

04:22.640 --> 04:26.400
and they really just have like a couple cameras in the lobby.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.400
Oh yeah.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.600
We were at the clinic and not the hospital, right?

04:29.600 --> 04:30.600
Correct.

04:30.600 --> 04:31.600
You're at the clinic in contention.

04:31.600 --> 04:37.800
The footage shows Billy Harrison in your uniform, just walking out the front door.

04:37.800 --> 04:38.800
Okay.

04:38.800 --> 04:44.160
Well, the guys are not going to be happy about this one.

04:44.160 --> 04:50.360
As you, as you, as you, uh, as you get to the front door, it is rather dark outside.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.400
What time did we get here?

04:51.400 --> 04:52.620
Early evening.

04:52.620 --> 04:55.640
So it's been like a couple hours or an hour or?

04:55.640 --> 05:00.360
I would say, yeah, I mean you came in and you waited around for a while for his results

05:00.360 --> 05:03.160
and for him to come to.

05:03.160 --> 05:04.600
And he had had a concussion.

05:04.600 --> 05:05.600
Is that right?

05:05.600 --> 05:06.600
Yes.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.600
Hmm.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.600
I rode here in the ambulance, didn't I?

05:08.600 --> 05:09.600
Correct.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.040
So I'm going to have to radio the guys to come get me.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.040
I think.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.040
Okay.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.040
Yeah.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.040
That sounds good.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.880
Okay.

05:21.880 --> 05:28.440
John had just finished getting handcuffs on Dr. Marie Jacobs when she hollered, and you

05:28.440 --> 05:33.040
heard something glumping up the stairs from the basement.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.120
What do you do?

05:34.120 --> 05:38.400
If I just hear footsteps going up the stairs, I'm just looking down the stairs.

05:38.400 --> 05:43.800
Clark, you've got your hand keeping the basement door open and you lean your head back to look

05:43.800 --> 05:51.600
down the stairs and you see a man with blood pouring down his face onto his chest from

05:51.600 --> 05:54.080
a seemingly broken nose.

05:54.080 --> 06:02.400
He is wearing a pair of novelty boxer briefs featuring Pepe Le Pew and a black collar around

06:02.400 --> 06:03.400
his neck.

06:03.400 --> 06:11.800
And he is on all fours making his way up the stairs at a rapid pace.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.800
John.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.560
I guess I draw my gun.

06:18.560 --> 06:19.920
And yell, stop right there.

06:19.920 --> 06:20.920
Same.

06:20.920 --> 06:22.320
I mean, as soon as I would see it.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.320
Okay.

06:23.560 --> 06:28.680
So, Clark, he is going to jump at you.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.240
He is like raising up onto his hind legs.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.620
Any visible claws?

06:33.620 --> 06:36.360
No claws, just hands.

06:36.360 --> 06:40.120
And he is, it looks like he's pouncing on you.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.080
I want to get away from that.

06:42.080 --> 06:46.680
So are you going to try to get away or how are you handling the situation?

06:46.680 --> 06:48.760
I would like to dodge out of the way.

06:48.760 --> 06:49.760
All right.

06:49.760 --> 06:50.760
Sounds good.

06:51.040 --> 06:54.000
Against his unarmed combat.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.520
Passed 24 on a 50.

06:55.520 --> 06:56.520
Okay.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.480
He passed 40 on a something.

06:58.480 --> 07:07.200
So he is going to, he actually, he rolled pounce.

07:07.200 --> 07:13.120
And so John, you actually see right next to you, this man takes Clark to the ground with

07:13.120 --> 07:15.400
his hands on Clark's shoulders.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.400
Huh?

07:16.400 --> 07:18.400
What the fuck?

07:18.920 --> 07:22.640
And it is John's action.

07:22.640 --> 07:23.640
Jesus.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.520
What do you do?

07:25.520 --> 07:27.880
I, uh, what is Marie doing?

07:27.880 --> 07:28.880
She's just handcuffed.

07:28.880 --> 07:29.880
Correct.

07:29.880 --> 07:33.640
She is not doing anything right now because it's your turn.

07:33.640 --> 07:34.640
Okay.

07:34.640 --> 07:37.400
I just yell, get off him.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.880
Come on, come on Salem.

07:38.880 --> 07:39.880
Get off.

07:39.880 --> 07:40.880
Fuck man.

07:40.880 --> 07:41.880
I don't know what to do in a cat man situation.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.120
Uh, I want to try to like kick him off.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.120
Okay.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.120
Get out of here.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.160
Get out of here.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.160
Get.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.160
Get.

07:50.160 --> 07:54.360
Roll unarmed combat to kick him off.

07:54.360 --> 07:57.440
Can I roll strength?

07:57.440 --> 08:00.440
If you, if you're trying to kick him, if you want to roll strength, that would be like

08:00.440 --> 08:04.520
trying to grab and like, I'm trying to push him with my leg muscles.

08:04.520 --> 08:05.520
Okay.

08:05.520 --> 08:09.040
I mean, an arm's fine.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.040
Neither one is great.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.040
Ooh.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.440
Pass 32 on a 40.

08:12.440 --> 08:13.440
Nice.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.440
Yeah.

08:14.440 --> 08:15.440
He's distracted right now.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.480
And so you put your foot where on his body?

08:18.480 --> 08:22.640
Like wherever I think I'm going to get the most leverage, like center mass, like right

08:22.640 --> 08:28.480
above his hip, you just like chest area, just trying to like, but I feel like I'm coming

08:28.480 --> 08:29.480
at him from the side.

08:29.480 --> 08:30.480
Right?

08:30.480 --> 08:31.480
Yeah.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.480
It's just a solid like rib like.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.480
Yeah.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.480
Right in the ribs.

08:34.480 --> 08:37.080
And you, uh, you, you, you hoist him off of Clark.

08:37.080 --> 08:40.280
Does he not seem to recognize that he has like a gun pointed at him?

08:40.280 --> 08:41.280
Like no.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.280
Okay.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.760
So he's pretty full cat man.

08:44.760 --> 08:49.040
And immediately Maria Marie says, don't, don't hurt him.

08:49.040 --> 08:50.040
Don't hurt him.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.040
Clark.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.040
It is your turn.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.680
Uh, we saw pictures earlier of her and her husband and the cat.

08:54.680 --> 08:55.680
That is correct.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.880
Does this guy look like the husband?

08:56.880 --> 08:57.880
This is Doug Jacobs.

08:57.880 --> 08:58.880
Okay.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.800
So say Salem, Doug is laying on the ground now.

09:01.800 --> 09:02.800
Yes.

09:02.800 --> 09:09.320
He has a, he has fallen over on his side and he just lays there and puts his hand on your

09:09.320 --> 09:10.320
face

09:10.320 --> 09:13.920
rub his belly.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.720
I want to try and cuff him.

09:15.720 --> 09:16.720
Okay.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.720
Roll law or dexterity.

09:17.720 --> 09:20.000
They happen to be the same.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Oh fun.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.040
38 on a 60.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.040
Okay.

09:24.040 --> 09:29.320
You reach out and throw a cuff on the hand that has reached out for your face and you

09:29.320 --> 09:32.400
can pretty easily get his other hand cuffed as well.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.400
Nice.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.400
Behind or in front?

09:34.400 --> 09:35.400
I would like behind.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.400
Okay.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.680
So you just kind of do a maneuver and roll over on him and handcuff him.

09:39.680 --> 09:44.480
So now you are on top of him and he is face down on the ground and he's just kind of laying

09:44.480 --> 09:45.480
there.

09:45.480 --> 09:46.480
He's not worried about it.

09:46.480 --> 09:47.480
He seems domesticated.

09:47.480 --> 09:48.480
Clark.

09:48.480 --> 09:52.000
Dr. Jacobs, do you want to tell us what the hell is going on here?

09:52.000 --> 09:54.560
Why is your husband a cat man named Salem?

09:54.560 --> 09:59.080
Oh, so you know that's what's going on here.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.560
Do you want to describe the process?

10:01.560 --> 10:04.800
Go ahead and roll sanity for me real quick.

10:04.800 --> 10:05.800
Both of you.

10:05.800 --> 10:06.800
Oh, 95.

10:06.800 --> 10:07.800
92.

10:07.800 --> 10:08.800
92.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.800
92.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.800
All right.

10:11.800 --> 10:12.800
You both lose one.

10:12.800 --> 10:13.800
I'm at 42 now.

10:13.800 --> 10:14.800
I'm at 43.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.640
I want to roll Doug over on so that he's looking at me.

10:18.640 --> 10:21.920
Hey, Salem, Doug, can you hear me?

10:21.920 --> 10:22.920
In English?

10:22.920 --> 10:24.880
He doesn't speak English.

10:24.880 --> 10:25.880
He's a cat.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.560
How long has he been a cat?

10:28.560 --> 10:30.560
Couple days.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.360
Okay.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.000
How did he become a cat?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.440
Why am I?

10:35.440 --> 10:38.020
Ma'am, this is all kinds of illegal.

10:38.020 --> 10:41.380
I don't think there's anything on the books.

10:41.380 --> 10:44.620
You can't have cat golems.

10:44.620 --> 10:45.620
It's not a golem.

10:45.620 --> 10:46.620
It's...

10:46.620 --> 10:48.860
Listen, lady, whatever the hell this is, you can't have, okay?

10:48.860 --> 10:49.860
I didn't ask for this.

10:49.860 --> 10:52.980
This belongs in a science lab or something.

10:52.980 --> 10:58.860
You can't just take away my cat because he happens to be taking the place inside the

10:58.860 --> 11:01.060
body of my husband.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.300
Oh.

11:02.300 --> 11:05.040
It's a regular old Salem in the body thing.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.040
It's a freaky Friday?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.040
It's a freaky Friday.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.100
Did your husband get freaky Frid- Doctor, I'm sorry.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.560
Did your husband get freaky Friday-ed?

11:10.560 --> 11:11.560
Which one?

11:11.560 --> 11:13.080
The Jimmy Lee Curtis.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.080
Oh.

11:14.080 --> 11:18.080
Yes.

11:18.080 --> 11:22.280
How did your husband get freaky Friday-ed?

11:22.280 --> 11:26.640
I'm not positive, but it happened when I got the radio.

11:26.640 --> 11:27.680
Interesting.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.640
You didn't think this was something you needed to tell anybody?

11:30.640 --> 11:35.760
I have personal reasons for being fine with the current situation.

11:35.760 --> 11:49.840
You know what, man?

11:49.840 --> 11:51.080
I think we needed that.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.520
I think we can all understand that a little bit.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.760
Is your husband in Salem?

11:55.760 --> 11:58.080
Where's the cat boy?

11:58.080 --> 12:03.080
Doug ran out of here almost immediately.

12:03.080 --> 12:10.640
It's not that he was a- Doug was not a very good man or a good husband.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.560
I was fine to be rid of him.

12:12.560 --> 12:18.360
If he wants to wander the streets as a kitty cat, that is totally fine by me.

12:18.360 --> 12:21.760
I don't think this concerns the police, honestly.

12:21.760 --> 12:26.920
You know, I can't tell you exactly how, but I am certain 100% this concerns the police.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.520
I just don't see it.

12:28.520 --> 12:31.960
There's a lot that feels illegal here, but you're right, I can't exactly put my finger

12:31.960 --> 12:32.960
on it.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.280
If only Maggie were here.

12:34.280 --> 12:38.080
I haven't been able to find any statute on the books.

12:38.080 --> 12:42.040
So you've been looking into, you had a suspicion, maybe this wasn't right.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.880
You've been checking your P's and Q's here?

12:43.880 --> 12:47.240
I quit Google search.

12:47.240 --> 12:52.280
Hey doctor, why is Doug man cat, cat man Doug, nose bleedin'?

12:52.280 --> 12:56.280
Oh, that tall awful man punched him in the face.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.040
I thought it was very rude.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.280
When he stole your radio?

12:59.280 --> 13:00.280
Yes!

13:00.280 --> 13:05.360
He was very aggressive, and Salem tried to protect me, thankfully he didn't shoot him.

13:05.360 --> 13:08.600
He follows instruction really well, you know, we could maybe use something like this on

13:08.600 --> 13:09.600
the force.

13:09.600 --> 13:14.880
This is my cat, and I'm not going to give him to the contention police department just

13:14.880 --> 13:18.480
because he's a giant man now.

13:18.480 --> 13:24.160
I mean he's a regular, he's a tall man, he's not, you know, giant per se, but...

13:24.160 --> 13:29.260
It's gonna take scientists and philosophers decades to figure out what this is.

13:29.260 --> 13:30.380
This is not your cat.

13:30.380 --> 13:37.340
I would personally appreciate it if we didn't go to scientists or authorities above yourselves.

13:37.340 --> 13:41.060
On this matter, if you could just leave me be, I don't see an issue here.

13:41.060 --> 13:43.140
Clark, you want to talk a minute?

13:43.140 --> 13:44.380
Me and you, yeah.

13:44.380 --> 13:49.020
We've garnered the information that the radio is not here anymore, that maybe our drunk

13:49.020 --> 13:50.540
Charlie guy took it.

13:50.540 --> 13:55.160
Right, and the lead we have on him is falling up on his hotel room, where maybe all this

13:55.160 --> 13:56.820
stuff might be waiting for us.

13:56.820 --> 14:03.460
John would be open to, like, John would just be like, oh, if you want this not talked about,

14:03.460 --> 14:04.460
what's in it for me?

14:04.460 --> 14:06.260
I don't, Clark wouldn't though, right?

14:06.260 --> 14:07.260
Probably?

14:07.260 --> 14:08.260
No.

14:08.260 --> 14:09.260
Yeah.

14:09.260 --> 14:12.180
But Clark is also a little insane and doesn't know, like, we real quick were happy with

14:12.180 --> 14:16.280
the Freaky Friday explanation, which I'm cool with, but so I don't know where to take him

14:16.280 --> 14:18.780
from here.

14:18.780 --> 14:22.500
He can still, I mean, he can, he could have not processed anything yet.

14:22.500 --> 14:26.460
He might just in the moment like, uh-huh, yeah, okay.

14:27.460 --> 14:29.180
Yeah, but this still leaves us, where do we go?

14:29.180 --> 14:30.180
Where do we go?

14:30.180 --> 14:31.180
Yeah.

14:31.180 --> 14:32.180
We've got to secure this cat man somehow.

14:32.180 --> 14:33.180
Thanks.

14:33.180 --> 14:34.180
God damn it.

14:34.180 --> 14:36.620
Do we take a cat man in?

14:36.620 --> 14:41.180
I think we should take them both in because it would be hilarious to have them in a jail cell.

14:41.180 --> 14:42.180
Yeah, let's do that.

14:42.180 --> 14:48.160
Ma'am, um, I'm really sorry to tell you this, but we're going to have to take you and Doug

14:48.160 --> 14:50.160
Salem in for further questioning.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.160
Just Salem?

14:51.160 --> 14:55.660
Well, again, the theological, the biological.

14:55.860 --> 14:56.860
Salem?

14:56.860 --> 14:57.860
In Doug's body.

14:57.860 --> 14:58.860
In Doug's body, yeah.

14:58.860 --> 14:59.860
Eh.

14:59.860 --> 15:03.540
This is your cat in spirit and his mind has inhabited your husband's body.

15:03.540 --> 15:05.660
Our vessels matter very little to me.

15:05.660 --> 15:08.660
Well, I don't know if they do to the law is the thing.

15:08.660 --> 15:12.320
In fact, most of our laws are about the harming of those vessels.

15:12.320 --> 15:13.460
This seems like harm.

15:13.460 --> 15:15.100
Yeah, he's a victim.

15:15.100 --> 15:20.980
Go catch, uh, go catch that drunk man.

15:20.980 --> 15:21.980
Yeah.

15:22.300 --> 15:26.360
Do we, I don't know if we need to take them like taking them in would be handy for us

15:26.360 --> 15:30.980
if we need to ask him or anything, anything more, but also just, I think it would be hilarious.

15:30.980 --> 15:31.980
Yeah.

15:31.980 --> 15:36.020
Doctor, uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to take you down to the station for 24 hours,

15:36.020 --> 15:39.880
48 maybe, uh, ask you a few more questions and what are you going to do?

15:39.880 --> 15:41.140
Put this on the books.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.500
Who's going to believe you?

15:42.500 --> 15:44.220
You're all going to be fired immediately.

15:44.220 --> 15:49.660
Actually, ma'am, uh, there is a bit of an, uh, managerial crisis at the police station

15:49.660 --> 15:50.660
right now.

15:50.820 --> 15:55.060
We don't have a whole lot of supervision at the moment, so I think for 48 hours we can,

15:55.060 --> 15:56.420
uh, get some more out of you.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.680
Well, I think that's genuinely horrifying.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.600
I think your cat husband is genuinely horrifying.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.380
I think he's rather cute.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.380
He's also that.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.860
Uh, does Salem have any, uh, toys he particularly likes?

16:07.860 --> 16:09.100
Clark, he's a perp.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.140
I just figured we'd have to get him in the car somehow.

16:11.140 --> 16:16.500
This is a man who literally just tackled a police officer.

16:16.500 --> 16:21.740
She kind of steps over to the side and reaches behind her back onto the couch.

16:21.740 --> 16:22.740
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:22.740 --> 16:23.740
Oh, sorry, sorry.

16:23.740 --> 16:25.340
This is his favorite toy.

16:25.340 --> 16:29.660
Well, why don't you, uh, stand on up and direct us to the toy?

16:29.660 --> 16:30.660
Okay.

16:30.660 --> 16:31.660
It's right here.

16:31.660 --> 16:37.660
And she kind of points with her chin down at a, uh, it's just a long string cat tail

16:37.660 --> 16:40.860
kind of thing that Salem immediately perks up at.

16:40.860 --> 16:42.980
I go and grab it.

16:42.980 --> 16:47.420
He's on the ground and he's handcuffed behind his back, but he is shuffling kind of over

16:47.420 --> 16:52.600
to you and nipping with his mouth at the end of the cat toy.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.600
That's real unsettling.

16:53.600 --> 16:58.420
And there's blood everywhere, all over his chest and it's dried and it's all over his

16:58.420 --> 16:59.420
mouth.

16:59.420 --> 17:04.020
You know, at the very least, he needs some medical attention, which he's not getting

17:04.020 --> 17:05.020
them.

17:05.020 --> 17:06.020
Yeah.

17:06.020 --> 17:10.140
I start using the cat toy to lead him into the back of my car.

17:11.140 --> 17:16.540
Here Salem, uh, get the, get the mousy.

17:16.540 --> 17:17.540
Come on.

17:17.540 --> 17:18.540
Follow me.

17:18.540 --> 17:19.540
Meow.

17:19.540 --> 17:20.540
Meow.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.540
Meow.

17:21.540 --> 17:26.140
I lead them all the way outside to the back of my car and throw the toy in.

17:26.140 --> 17:29.860
Dr. Marie Jacobs will reluctantly follow.

17:29.860 --> 17:35.980
She's laughing to herself the entire time she walks to the cruiser.

17:35.980 --> 17:37.140
As well as she should.

17:37.140 --> 17:43.720
And once you guys get out to the cruiser, you get a call from Keith Vigna on your cell

17:43.720 --> 17:53.100
phone.

17:53.100 --> 17:54.100
Welcome back everybody.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.100
Do we start?

17:55.100 --> 17:56.100
He didn't say one.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.100
Oh shit.

17:57.100 --> 17:58.100
Yeah.

17:58.100 --> 17:59.100
Start over.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.100
Okay.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.100
Sorry.

18:01.100 --> 18:02.100
Three, two.

18:02.100 --> 18:03.100
Welcome back everybody.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.100
Did he?

18:04.100 --> 18:05.100
He didn't say it.

18:05.100 --> 18:06.100
We got to start over.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.100
I don't think we're supposed to start.

18:08.060 --> 18:09.060
Four, three.

18:09.060 --> 18:10.060
Yeah.

18:10.060 --> 18:12.260
I'm just not hearing it in the phone.

18:12.260 --> 18:13.260
I'm not getting it.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.260
No, I'm not getting that one.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.260
There's a short in my.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.260
Not getting that go.

18:16.260 --> 18:17.260
I don't think.

18:17.260 --> 18:18.260
That go word.

18:18.260 --> 18:23.920
So Clark, you receive a call on your cell phone from a number that comes up as the contention

18:23.920 --> 18:24.920
clinic.

18:24.920 --> 18:25.920
Officer Bishop.

18:25.920 --> 18:26.920
Hey, it's Keith.

18:26.920 --> 18:27.920
Hey Keith.

18:27.920 --> 18:31.220
I need a ride because remember I rode here in the ambulance.

18:31.220 --> 18:32.220
Oh, that's right.

18:32.220 --> 18:35.700
Our imitating life.

18:35.700 --> 18:38.740
I got a couple of perps in my car.

18:38.740 --> 18:40.060
I'll send John your way.

18:40.060 --> 18:41.060
Who's the perps.

18:41.060 --> 18:42.060
Uh, congratulations.

18:42.060 --> 18:44.380
It's a, it's, it's a real long story.

18:44.380 --> 18:45.380
You'll uh, cool.

18:45.380 --> 18:52.420
Well, I'm glad that you got some perps cause I'm not a big deal, but, uh, well I'll just

18:52.420 --> 18:56.060
let John see me when he gets here, send him over my way.

18:56.060 --> 18:57.060
Yeah.

18:57.060 --> 18:58.060
That's what I'll do.

18:58.060 --> 18:59.060
Okay.

18:59.060 --> 19:00.060
Have a great one.

19:00.060 --> 19:01.060
Bye.

19:01.060 --> 19:02.060
I click.

19:02.060 --> 19:03.140
Uh, Hey John.

19:03.140 --> 19:04.660
It sounds like Keith fucked up again.

19:04.660 --> 19:05.660
Yeah.

19:05.820 --> 19:09.380
He's just becoming less and less effective as he loses motility.

19:09.380 --> 19:10.800
He needs a ride though from the clinic.

19:10.800 --> 19:14.060
I'm going to take these guys back to the station and uh, I'll meet you guys there.

19:14.060 --> 19:15.060
Right on.

19:23.740 --> 19:26.660
John, you pull up to the clinic.

19:26.660 --> 19:29.200
The sun is very down by now.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.760
It is a late evening.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.740
I don't remember if I could walk or not.

19:32.740 --> 19:33.880
Yes, I can.

19:33.880 --> 19:34.880
You can walk now.

19:34.880 --> 19:35.880
Okay, cool.

19:35.880 --> 19:36.880
You can walk.

19:36.880 --> 19:37.880
You're just a little hobbled.

19:37.880 --> 19:38.880
Gotcha.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.680
Luke, do you want to describe what John sees when he pulls up?

19:41.680 --> 19:48.440
Um, I'm standing outside in just a hospital gown with some nice new bracelets on, uh,

19:48.440 --> 19:50.480
they're handcuffs and I had to cut the chain.

19:50.480 --> 19:54.880
So the chains are just kind of flopping down on either side and uh, I have no shoes or

19:54.880 --> 20:03.480
anything else on and I'm waving John down to come get me.

20:03.480 --> 20:06.380
John sees that pulling up and it's just like, what the fuck?

20:06.380 --> 20:12.920
I popped the passenger door open and go, well, you wouldn't believe what happened.

20:12.920 --> 20:18.720
Yeah, we uh, we, we had something a little strange happen to us as well.

20:18.720 --> 20:21.480
Well, I heard that you got a couple guys.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.640
That means we're up.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.640
One woman and one undetermined.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.920
Oh, interesting.

20:28.920 --> 20:33.240
Let's go back to the police department so I can get my change of clothes.

20:33.240 --> 20:37.320
It's a little breezy in this gown.

20:37.320 --> 20:41.560
Also yeah, he attacked me and handcuffed me to the bed and he got away, stole all my stuff.

20:41.560 --> 20:42.560
Who attacked you?

20:42.560 --> 20:45.440
The guy that we took to the, to the clinic.

20:45.440 --> 20:46.440
Billy Harrison.

20:46.440 --> 20:47.440
Oh, the soldier?

20:47.440 --> 20:48.440
Yeah.

20:48.440 --> 20:49.440
Okay.

20:49.440 --> 20:54.300
So I had a conversation with him about John Peters.

20:54.300 --> 20:58.240
Something was up there and then he, I was kind of catching onto something and so he,

20:58.680 --> 21:04.560
I don't really, it was kind of a blur, but next thing I know, you know, people are taking

21:04.560 --> 21:10.840
pictures of me and laughing at me, you know, cause I was chained to the bed.

21:10.840 --> 21:13.140
Did he cuff you with your own handcuffs?

21:13.140 --> 21:14.140
He did.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.140
Vigna.

21:15.140 --> 21:17.320
He stole my gun too.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.040
Oh my God, Vigna.

21:19.040 --> 21:22.880
And he's probably wearing, I, I know that he's wearing my uniform right now.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.880
God damn it.

21:24.880 --> 21:25.880
Vigna.

21:25.880 --> 21:26.880
Vigna.

21:26.880 --> 21:27.880
Shoot.

21:27.880 --> 21:28.880
I did the best.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.320
I didn't do the best I could do.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.840
I can do better next time.

21:31.840 --> 21:32.840
Clearly.

21:32.840 --> 21:33.840
Can you?

21:33.840 --> 21:34.840
I promise.

21:34.840 --> 21:40.080
Let's just get back to the police department so I can get into a change of clothes.

21:40.080 --> 21:43.540
All thoughts of a cat man are out of John's mind.

21:43.540 --> 21:44.540
Cat man?

21:44.540 --> 21:46.760
He just thought it and in fact didn't thought it.

21:46.760 --> 21:47.760
So.

21:47.760 --> 21:48.760
Okay.

21:48.760 --> 21:49.760
You haven't heard that yet.

21:49.760 --> 21:54.040
Well, don't, don't tell Clark about, well, I guess I'm going to have to tell Clark about

21:54.040 --> 21:55.040
this.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.160
Oh, I'm going to tell Clark about this.

21:58.160 --> 22:04.040
We followed up on Dr. Marie Jacobs and that radio Freaky Friday'd her husband and her

22:04.040 --> 22:05.040
cat.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.040
According to her.

22:06.040 --> 22:09.680
Her husband is in her cat's body and her cat is in her husband's body?

22:09.680 --> 22:12.440
You are grasping it right away.

22:12.440 --> 22:13.440
Cool.

22:13.440 --> 22:17.700
So as soon as we get you all- Wait, so do you arrest them?

22:17.700 --> 22:21.980
We arrested the husband's body and the cat and Dr. Marie Jacobs.

22:21.980 --> 22:25.260
The cat with the husband's mind is MIA.

22:25.260 --> 22:28.660
It ran away or- It ran off apparently the second the switch

22:28.660 --> 22:29.660
happened.

22:29.660 --> 22:30.660
Okay.

22:30.660 --> 22:32.580
Well, that'll be- Can he talk or does he meow?

22:32.580 --> 22:33.580
He meows.

22:33.580 --> 22:34.980
He's a friendly little bugger though.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.420
This'll be a sight to see.

22:36.420 --> 22:40.180
I don't really believe you, but- Yeah, I don't know why I'd lie about something like that.

22:40.180 --> 22:46.180
Alright, so you guys make it to the police station and when you arrive, what are you

22:46.180 --> 22:47.180
up to?

22:47.180 --> 22:54.180
As soon as I got there, I stepped inside and I said to Drew, Hey, uh, Drew, I need you

22:54.180 --> 23:00.540
to get together some blankies and, uh, make, it's like a cat bed, but for like a human

23:00.540 --> 23:02.980
size cat in one of the cells for me.

23:02.980 --> 23:03.980
Okay.

23:03.980 --> 23:04.980
Thank you, Drew.

23:04.980 --> 23:05.980
Yeah, of course.

23:05.980 --> 23:09.440
Then I go back out to the cruiser, I open the door and I say, doctor, would you, would

23:09.440 --> 23:12.140
you mind helping me make sure Salem gets in here real safe?

23:12.140 --> 23:13.140
Yeah, of course.

23:13.140 --> 23:16.440
So I'm using the toy, but I'm also hoping that she is taking up the rear.

23:16.440 --> 23:17.440
She is.

23:17.440 --> 23:18.440
Yeah.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.440
No, they're gonna, yeah.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.440
She's going to play ball.

23:20.440 --> 23:26.960
And I'm leading the cat man into, and you guys go into the police station and there's

23:26.960 --> 23:30.560
one open cell inside it is a blanket palette.

23:30.560 --> 23:36.880
The other cells are filled with stuff that you guys took from the storage units.

23:36.880 --> 23:37.880
Right.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.720
I'm going to lead them both into the cell.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.300
She is cracking up.

23:41.300 --> 23:45.900
She thinks this is the funniest thing that's ever happened and she keeps saying things

23:45.900 --> 23:50.980
to you like, who's gonna believe you?

23:50.980 --> 23:51.980
No one.

23:51.980 --> 23:52.980
Absolutely no one.

23:52.980 --> 23:53.980
I think Drew believed me.

23:53.980 --> 23:56.180
Drew, you believe me that this is a cat man?

23:56.180 --> 24:04.140
Drew is pouring coffee onto the floor, missing his mug completely.

24:04.140 --> 24:05.500
Another late night.

24:05.500 --> 24:06.500
Um, yep.

24:06.500 --> 24:07.500
See, he believes me.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.500
You said cat man.

24:08.500 --> 24:09.500
Yeah.

24:09.500 --> 24:10.500
That's you believe me.

24:10.500 --> 24:11.500
Drew, you believe me?

24:11.500 --> 24:12.500
Yes.

24:12.500 --> 24:13.500
Clark.

24:13.500 --> 24:14.500
Sorry.

24:14.500 --> 24:15.500
Officer Bishop.

24:16.100 --> 24:17.100
Excuse me.

24:17.100 --> 24:18.100
So we at least got something going here.

24:18.100 --> 24:22.160
We're going to figure things out, but, uh, for now I just want you guys to rest in here.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.160
Do you have their IDs?

24:23.160 --> 24:25.340
Do you want me to start on the paperwork?

24:25.340 --> 24:27.980
Uh, doctor, do you have your ID on you?

24:27.980 --> 24:28.980
Yes, of course.

24:28.980 --> 24:30.260
Can we get, can I borrow that?

24:30.260 --> 24:32.060
She hands you her ID.

24:32.060 --> 24:34.620
Doug is not wearing pants.

24:34.620 --> 24:35.620
Yeah.

24:35.620 --> 24:38.300
Uh, Drew, uh, we got hers.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.780
Doug is a cat man.

24:39.780 --> 24:44.780
Um, he doesn't have his ID on him, but, uh, if you'll run hers, you can run her husband

24:44.780 --> 24:45.780
too.

24:45.780 --> 24:46.780
You should check them up.

24:46.780 --> 24:47.780
Doug Jacobs.

24:47.780 --> 24:48.780
Okay.

24:48.780 --> 24:49.780
Sounds good.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.980
I'll, I'll start putting it in the system.

24:51.980 --> 24:58.020
Thanks Drew.

24:58.020 --> 24:59.020
All right.

24:59.020 --> 25:02.260
So John and Keith arrive at the station.

25:02.260 --> 25:05.220
I go to my desk and open up.

25:05.220 --> 25:09.820
Hey everybody, look at Keith.

25:09.820 --> 25:14.340
I run as fast as I can over to my desk and try to get the extra uniform out and just

25:14.340 --> 25:16.180
put it on with my gown on.

25:16.180 --> 25:17.420
I'm not even taking my gown off.

25:17.420 --> 25:19.180
I'm just putting it on over my gown.

25:19.180 --> 25:20.180
Okay.

25:20.180 --> 25:21.180
Keith.

25:21.180 --> 25:27.580
Hey, um, before you say anything, do we have an extra, um, set of keys to this particular

25:27.580 --> 25:28.580
set of handcuffs?

25:28.580 --> 25:31.580
Keith, are those your handcuffs?

25:31.580 --> 25:35.220
Yes, but I lost the key to them.

25:35.220 --> 25:37.860
Soldier boy handcuffed him up and stole his gun.

25:37.860 --> 25:41.140
Oh, he's also out there with his uniform, so we should probably get on that.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.140
That's nice.

25:42.140 --> 25:43.140
Keith.

25:43.140 --> 25:44.140
Pretty dangerous.

25:44.940 --> 25:48.740
It sounds really bad, but it wasn't like, you know, it all happened pretty quickly.

25:48.740 --> 25:52.580
I don't think the other, you could have stopped it from happening either.

25:52.580 --> 26:02.860
He's an army man and now he's an honorary police officer for contingent.

26:02.860 --> 26:04.160
We can spin this.

26:04.160 --> 26:08.660
We can spin this so that it looks like we're improving the force while he's talking while

26:08.660 --> 26:09.660
we're having the conversation.

26:09.660 --> 26:11.420
I'm going in and finding the keys for the cuffs.

26:11.420 --> 26:12.420
Yeah.

26:12.420 --> 26:20.260
And then, uh, we'll have Keith Vigna, roll luck, 41 on a 60.

26:20.260 --> 26:21.260
You find the keys.

26:21.260 --> 26:22.260
So while I'm uncuffing him.

26:22.260 --> 26:26.340
So before he got the jump on you, did you get a chance to talk to him, glean anything

26:26.340 --> 26:27.340
from him?

26:27.340 --> 26:28.340
Yeah.

26:28.340 --> 26:30.100
So we talked, I asked him some questions about John Peters.

26:30.100 --> 26:31.100
Hold on.

26:31.100 --> 26:34.380
I don't remember exactly what I talked to him about.

26:34.380 --> 26:35.380
Yeah.

26:35.380 --> 26:36.380
Yeah.

26:36.380 --> 26:37.380
He hit me in the head pretty hard.

26:37.380 --> 26:40.860
So some of that conversation was a little bit of a blur, but for the most part we talked

26:40.860 --> 26:43.420
about him being friends with John Peters.

26:43.420 --> 26:48.860
He told me they played video games together, but I don't know why he was like peeking around

26:48.860 --> 26:52.300
John Peters house cause they hadn't, they don't talk all the time, but he said they

26:52.300 --> 26:53.340
hadn't talked in a while.

26:53.340 --> 26:56.500
So he was poking around, but I started to not really believe that.

26:56.500 --> 27:01.940
And as soon as I showed any kind of a, like that I wasn't believing him, he, that's when

27:01.940 --> 27:03.460
it kind of turns into a blur.

27:03.460 --> 27:08.260
You know, the guy that came in saying he was friends with John Peters also, he was trying

27:08.260 --> 27:09.260
to find his keys.

27:09.260 --> 27:12.700
So people keep trying to say that they're his friend and then get weird.

27:12.700 --> 27:13.700
Yeah, that's true.

27:13.700 --> 27:19.100
While you guys are having this discussion, Drew kind of walks over to John and he's like,

27:19.100 --> 27:21.940
Hey, um, can I talk to you real quick in the back room?

27:21.940 --> 27:22.940
Sure.

27:22.940 --> 27:23.940
A little buddy.

27:23.940 --> 27:27.140
You guys want to head out of the room real quick?

27:27.140 --> 27:33.580
Anything you can say to me?

27:33.580 --> 27:39.220
Drew leads you into the back room and he's like, Hey, um, you guys went out to, um,

27:39.260 --> 27:48.060
to Splashylvania and you sent Lauren out there and she said that there was just blood and

27:48.060 --> 27:50.180
gore everywhere.

27:50.180 --> 27:57.540
Now I, I asked her if it, if it looked like a deer and she said no, but I convinced her

27:57.540 --> 28:02.740
that it was just, uh, that we'd heard like a deer accidentally fell off a water slide.

28:02.740 --> 28:07.820
But that is a, that's a hilarious excuse.

28:07.820 --> 28:08.820
Thank you.

28:08.900 --> 28:10.900
What happened?

28:10.900 --> 28:14.580
Did you guys, what's going on, John?

28:14.580 --> 28:16.820
Did you guys kill someone?

28:16.820 --> 28:17.820
Yes and no.

28:17.820 --> 28:21.420
Oh my God, Drew, you should have seen this shot.

28:21.420 --> 28:28.820
It was fucking pretty as a picture, but it turns out Julie Maxwell, she killed old Leo.

28:28.820 --> 28:30.940
Uh, so we had to shoot her.

28:30.940 --> 28:33.380
Clark just, you know, right between the eyes.

28:33.380 --> 28:37.860
Does this have to do with all the cocaine?

28:37.860 --> 28:38.860
The what now?

28:38.860 --> 28:42.100
John, I found all the cocaine in the lockup.

28:42.100 --> 28:44.900
Oh God, it's been such a full day.

28:44.900 --> 28:50.220
I got curious about what all was confiscated and John, that's a lot of money's worth of

28:50.220 --> 28:51.220
cocaine Dean.

28:51.220 --> 28:52.660
Aren't you glad it's off the streets?

28:52.660 --> 28:55.060
Do you know how much there is?

28:55.060 --> 28:56.060
How much it costs?

28:56.060 --> 29:00.100
I mean, I'll, I'll have to have that information when I write up my report.

29:00.100 --> 29:02.140
Oh, don't you worry about that one.

29:02.140 --> 29:05.860
This is still an ongoing investigation, so you don't need to write anything up on that.

29:05.860 --> 29:06.860
Okay.

29:06.860 --> 29:11.780
Well, Drew, you know what, I'm going to, there's something big going on in contention.

29:11.780 --> 29:12.780
I'm going to level with you.

29:12.780 --> 29:15.340
We don't know what it is, but we've got it under control.

29:15.340 --> 29:16.340
We're working towards it.

29:16.340 --> 29:18.260
I feel like we're about to break this thing.

29:18.260 --> 29:19.660
You know what would help a whole lot though?

29:19.660 --> 29:20.660
What?

29:20.660 --> 29:21.660
If we had Maggie around.

29:21.660 --> 29:22.660
Yeah.

29:22.660 --> 29:26.040
Drew, can you, can you do everything in your power to, that's, that's what I want you.

29:26.040 --> 29:27.660
Don't worry about these reports, man.

29:27.660 --> 29:29.500
Just focus on finding the chief.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.780
We need her leadership at a time like this.

29:31.780 --> 29:32.780
Okay.

29:32.780 --> 29:33.780
I will.

29:33.780 --> 29:34.780
I will.

29:35.780 --> 29:50.900
Um, you wouldn't, John, you, you wouldn't be interested in unloading that cocaine, would

29:50.900 --> 29:51.900
you?

29:54.900 --> 29:57.900
Is this some kind of test?

29:57.900 --> 29:58.900
No.

29:58.900 --> 30:01.020
John, I did the math.

30:01.020 --> 30:03.780
That's millions of dollars worth of cocaine.

30:03.780 --> 30:07.700
In fact, that's $10 million worth of cocaine.

30:07.700 --> 30:12.100
That's what are you suggesting, Drew?

30:12.100 --> 30:22.660
Well, I know that you have a bit of a history and uh, I mean, I slam them against the wall.

30:22.660 --> 30:26.380
Drew, anything you think you know about me, you don't.

30:26.380 --> 30:29.100
All right.

30:29.100 --> 30:30.100
I'm just fucking with you.

30:30.100 --> 30:31.100
Let's sell this cocaine.

30:31.100 --> 30:32.100
Okay, thank God.

30:32.100 --> 30:33.100
Holy shit.

30:33.420 --> 30:36.820
We already have a buyer set up in the city and he's going to pay us $10 million.

30:36.820 --> 30:41.060
If we get Keith and Clark in on it too, they can help out and that's two and a half million

30:41.060 --> 30:42.060
dollars each.

30:42.060 --> 30:44.260
I don't think we're going to get Clark in on this.

30:44.260 --> 30:45.260
Okay, that's fine.

30:45.260 --> 30:48.420
That's $3.3 million each, but that's going to be hard.

30:48.420 --> 30:52.100
I don't know if we need to get Keith in on this.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.740
That's $5 million each.

30:55.740 --> 30:56.740
You and me, buddy.

30:56.740 --> 30:57.740
Okay.

30:57.740 --> 31:03.660
Well, there's, his name is the Duke and uh, we're gonna, we're waiting right now to hear

31:03.660 --> 31:05.900
back from him on where to meet.

31:05.900 --> 31:09.360
And he's got a glint in his eye of like pure ecstasy.

31:09.360 --> 31:12.260
You are a much more interesting man than I figured you for.

31:12.260 --> 31:15.540
We're going to be millionaires, Jon.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.540
That's right.

31:16.540 --> 31:19.460
We're going to be millionaires.

31:19.460 --> 31:23.180
Both of us.

31:23.180 --> 31:24.780
And he's just like giggling.

31:24.780 --> 31:25.980
He's very happy.

31:25.980 --> 31:28.180
And then he's like, also, I fixed the four wheeler.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.180
Hell yeah, buddy.

31:29.180 --> 31:30.180
Okay.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.180
Okay.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.540
Uh, we'll, we'll talk about this later.

31:33.540 --> 31:34.540
Okay.

31:34.540 --> 31:41.460
Well, um, yeah, if you do breathe a word of this to anybody else, I'll kill you.

31:41.460 --> 31:42.460
So don't.

31:42.460 --> 31:43.460
Okay.

31:43.460 --> 31:44.460
Okay.

31:44.460 --> 31:45.460
Okay.

31:45.460 --> 31:46.460
Okay.

31:46.460 --> 31:47.460
Oh boy.

31:47.460 --> 31:48.460
Okay.

31:48.460 --> 31:49.460
Cool.

31:49.460 --> 31:50.460
Yeah.

31:50.460 --> 31:51.460
Okay.

31:51.460 --> 31:52.460
Bye.

31:52.460 --> 31:55.460
And he walks back out into the room.

31:56.140 --> 32:02.740
Drew comes back out from the back room while you guys are having the conversation.

32:02.740 --> 32:06.340
Jon comes out shortly after good news guys drew fix the four wheeler.

32:06.340 --> 32:07.340
Hell yeah.

32:07.340 --> 32:08.340
Vroom, vroom.

32:08.340 --> 32:09.340
Okay.

32:09.340 --> 32:17.860
So Clark, Clark, I believe you were asking Keith about his bad cop work.

32:17.860 --> 32:20.180
He was just a better criminal than I was a cop.

32:20.180 --> 32:27.740
I wasn't a bad cop, which means we really should find him.

32:27.740 --> 32:29.660
How long ago did this all happen?

32:29.660 --> 32:30.660
Two hours ago.

32:30.660 --> 32:33.500
Did anybody at the hospital see where he went or no?

32:33.500 --> 32:35.140
I looked at the security footage.

32:35.140 --> 32:38.740
The only shot they got out of him was like him leaving the lobby, basically dressed as

32:38.740 --> 32:39.740
me.

32:39.740 --> 32:40.740
So nobody knows where he went.

32:40.740 --> 32:44.320
Hey drew, in the last hour or two, you get any calls about us working on something you

32:44.320 --> 32:45.740
had heard from us about?

32:45.740 --> 32:46.740
Nope.

32:46.740 --> 32:49.660
Let me double check that my car is still parked out front.

32:49.660 --> 32:50.660
It is.

32:50.660 --> 32:51.660
Cool.

32:51.660 --> 32:52.660
So yeah, he didn't steal my car though.

32:52.660 --> 32:54.540
So we got that going for us.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.540
So why did you arrest them?

32:56.540 --> 32:59.860
You know, it was real confusing at the time.

32:59.860 --> 33:02.860
At the very least it seemed like things weren't right.

33:02.860 --> 33:04.380
So on a hunch.

33:04.380 --> 33:05.980
He's got this real bad bloody nose.

33:05.980 --> 33:09.580
So we, I mean, at the very least he's hurt.

33:09.580 --> 33:14.820
Did she punch him or she says, so yeah, here's the, so she had the radio, right?

33:14.820 --> 33:17.460
And she had the radio.

33:17.460 --> 33:20.380
So back at the treasured place.

33:20.380 --> 33:21.580
So she was the one who bought the radio.

33:21.580 --> 33:23.400
So we went to see if she had the radio.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.780
She said, no, somebody had taken it.

33:24.780 --> 33:25.980
We said, who?

33:25.980 --> 33:30.020
And she described a tall, angry surly man had come and taken it.

33:30.020 --> 33:31.580
Did that ring any bells?

33:31.580 --> 33:32.580
We think it's Charles.

33:32.580 --> 33:33.580
Yeah.

33:33.580 --> 33:35.240
We think you rung his bell earlier today.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.020
Where would the radio be then?

33:37.020 --> 33:40.660
We think it might be back at his hotel room, which we found out.

33:40.660 --> 33:41.660
Yeah.

33:41.660 --> 33:42.660
Okay.

33:42.660 --> 33:43.660
And we haven't been there yet, have we?

33:43.660 --> 33:44.660
We've not been there yet.

33:44.660 --> 33:45.660
So that's kind of our biggest lead.

33:45.660 --> 33:49.260
When he came in, he punched Salem Doug cap man.

33:49.260 --> 33:52.160
How did this freaky Friday situation happen?

33:52.160 --> 33:53.260
She blamed it on the radio.

33:53.260 --> 33:54.260
Okay.

33:54.260 --> 33:55.260
That makes sense.

33:55.260 --> 33:56.260
Totally.

33:56.260 --> 33:57.260
Let's you know what?

33:57.260 --> 34:01.180
I'll go check out his apartment with the help of you guys.

34:01.180 --> 34:02.180
Yes.

34:02.180 --> 34:03.540
A hundred percent.

34:03.540 --> 34:07.700
That should be our next step for the mystery, but we should probably find there's somebody

34:07.700 --> 34:09.780
out there in your clothes.

34:09.780 --> 34:13.020
How would you suggest we, I don't know.

34:13.020 --> 34:14.020
Oh dude.

34:14.380 --> 34:19.380
And call call for him and see if he answers my radio walkie talkie, whatever it is.

34:19.380 --> 34:23.780
Oh, send out a call on the radio that sets up an irresistible trap for him.

34:23.780 --> 34:24.780
Ooh.

34:24.780 --> 34:25.780
I like that.

34:25.780 --> 34:26.780
I like that too.

34:26.780 --> 34:27.900
Got a good head on you, John.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.340
So we know he was looking for John Peters, I think.

34:30.340 --> 34:35.540
So maybe we should say that John Peters is somewhere and then he won't be there, but

34:35.540 --> 34:36.540
we will.

34:36.540 --> 34:37.540
Yeah.

34:37.540 --> 34:42.140
We're like a free buffet for soldiers with John Peters.

34:42.140 --> 34:45.140
John Peters is hosting a free buffet for soldiers.

34:45.140 --> 34:47.560
Charles had this guy in his trunk.

34:47.560 --> 34:48.560
That's true.

34:48.560 --> 34:49.740
So this guy might be out for vengeance.

34:49.740 --> 34:51.700
He might be at the hotel already.

34:51.700 --> 34:53.460
Did you tell him that you killed Charles?

34:53.460 --> 34:56.820
I don't think if that came up so we can, yeah, we can see if he's poking around Charles's

34:56.820 --> 34:57.820
place.

34:57.820 --> 34:58.820
Okay.

34:58.820 --> 34:59.820
Wonder where Charles first ran into this guy.

34:59.820 --> 35:01.460
You know, where did he abduct him?

35:01.460 --> 35:03.200
He didn't remember.

35:03.200 --> 35:06.320
I think when I asked him, I think I might've suffered a concussion too.

35:06.320 --> 35:11.440
So some of these details are a little, little off for me here, but I feel fine now.

35:11.440 --> 35:12.600
Just don't let me go to sleep.

35:12.600 --> 35:13.880
That's actually outdated information.

35:13.880 --> 35:14.880
Oh, okay.

35:14.880 --> 35:20.480
I'm going to take a nap in the back of the cruiser then while we are at the motel.

35:20.480 --> 35:21.600
How are you feeling on that foot?

35:21.600 --> 35:22.600
Much better.

35:22.600 --> 35:26.720
I can walk, but I am not back to where I was, but I will get there soon.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.360
We can probably take three cars then.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.360
I can drive.

35:29.360 --> 35:30.360
Yeah.

35:30.360 --> 35:34.680
So you would remember that Billy said that his last memory was looking in a window at

35:34.680 --> 35:35.680
John Peters house.

35:35.680 --> 35:40.600
At least that's what he told me, but I had a pretty reasonable suspicion about him and

35:40.600 --> 35:43.360
kind of confronted him on it and that's what started the violence.

35:43.360 --> 35:47.760
If he's telling the truth though, he might've been caught snooping around outside the house

35:47.760 --> 35:50.360
by Charles, who was also snooping.

35:50.360 --> 35:51.940
That's what I was probably thinking.

35:51.940 --> 35:55.320
Did he say why he was snooping, why he was looking around the windows?

35:55.320 --> 35:59.420
He said that John Peters is his friend and they play video games together and he hadn't

35:59.420 --> 36:02.840
heard from him in a while, so he went over to check it out, but that's kind of when his

36:02.840 --> 36:07.200
story started not making a whole lot of sense.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.280
How old is John Peters?

36:08.600 --> 36:11.720
John Peters is 30 years old.

36:11.720 --> 36:15.920
And Billy, Billy Harrison is probably around that same age, right?

36:15.920 --> 36:17.560
I think his ID said he was 31.

36:17.560 --> 36:18.560
Yeah.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.720
It makes sense that those guys would play video games together.

36:20.720 --> 36:25.260
I got the feeling that that was either a half truth or just a story.

36:25.260 --> 36:29.040
It raised my suspicion because I was thinking of John Peters as like an old man.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.040
Okay.

36:30.040 --> 36:31.040
Yeah.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.600
Can you remember any specifics about how his story started falling apart?

36:33.600 --> 36:35.520
Do you remember where you caught him?

36:35.560 --> 36:39.360
Well, they had grown up together, I think, and then for a long time had just been playing

36:39.360 --> 36:42.600
video games together and they weren't like super close friends.

36:42.600 --> 36:47.460
So it was just strange that he would feel the need to go to his house, especially when

36:47.460 --> 36:50.040
all of this crazy stuff is going on.

36:50.040 --> 36:53.440
And then it was, it made me even more suspicious when he attacked me.

36:53.440 --> 36:58.300
I was like something, I don't think this guy's just telling the whole truth.

36:58.300 --> 36:59.300
This fella.

37:06.520 --> 37:10.440
All right, fellas, I guess we should head to the hotel first.

37:10.440 --> 37:13.520
Hotel Motel.

37:13.520 --> 37:16.240
Can we call the Motel Hotel Motel?

37:16.240 --> 37:17.240
Holiday.

37:17.240 --> 37:18.240
Motel.

37:18.240 --> 37:19.240
Motel.

37:19.240 --> 37:25.680
Okay, so if you want to continue the evening doing adventure investigating type stuff,

37:25.680 --> 37:27.040
you'll all lose some willpower.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.040
That's right.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.040
He already said it was late.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.040
We have to go to sleep soon.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.620
I feel like we should go now though because it's while it's fresh.

37:32.620 --> 37:34.640
And that guy's out there in green uniform.

37:34.640 --> 37:37.120
We really need to hire some more cops in this town.

37:37.120 --> 37:39.560
Well, we potentially have a fourth one.

37:39.560 --> 37:40.560
Just depends on what he's doing.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.800
If he's doing crime or if he's, yeah, what if he's out there just doing our jobs?

37:43.800 --> 37:46.400
Like maybe we should just let him keep at it.

37:46.400 --> 37:47.400
Seems competent.

37:47.400 --> 37:51.460
Did we ever figure out where he was, what country he was a soldier for?

37:51.460 --> 37:55.300
He might be an Al-Qaeda.

37:55.300 --> 37:58.960
You got your ass kicked by a Canadian soldier.

37:58.960 --> 37:59.960
He's a Mountie.

37:59.960 --> 38:01.260
Billy's a pretty Russian name.

38:01.260 --> 38:02.860
You said we were going to lose willpower.

38:02.860 --> 38:03.860
How much?

38:03.900 --> 38:04.900
Just to get that back.

38:04.900 --> 38:05.900
I can't remember mechanically.

38:05.900 --> 38:06.900
Sleep.

38:06.900 --> 38:07.900
Sleep, right?

38:07.900 --> 38:08.900
You regain it when you sleep?

38:08.900 --> 38:09.900
Okay.

38:09.900 --> 38:11.580
So a full night's rest regains one D six willpower.

38:11.580 --> 38:12.580
Okay, cool.

38:12.580 --> 38:14.180
How much are we going to lose if we stay up?

38:14.180 --> 38:18.860
You're going to lose one willpower per hour that you stay up starting now.

38:18.860 --> 38:20.860
So everybody lose one willpower.

38:20.860 --> 38:23.620
Good thing none of us are magic users.

38:23.620 --> 38:33.020
For the listeners, willpower is one of the statistics in this game that is used for keeping

38:33.020 --> 38:40.720
your shit together when going through a mental disorder or staying up late or trying to resist

38:40.720 --> 38:44.700
interrogation or anything of that nature.

38:44.700 --> 38:49.940
It'll also maybe come in handy when spells are introduced.

38:49.940 --> 38:53.780
If they are willpower is also used for that.

38:53.780 --> 38:54.780
Pew pew.

38:54.780 --> 38:59.120
If we were actually just three guys trying to go find this guy, we'd all go out in separate

38:59.120 --> 39:02.100
cars and just like search the town, I guess.

39:02.100 --> 39:04.140
Do you trust me to do that?

39:04.140 --> 39:09.260
As a, as your character, would you trust Keith to go out looking for the guy that bested

39:09.260 --> 39:10.460
him last time?

39:10.460 --> 39:14.660
As long as you radioed in when you found him and didn't move to engage.

39:14.660 --> 39:16.380
Where else would you want to check out then?

39:16.380 --> 39:19.900
Well, we have to go to the hotel too and like maybe sooner rather than later, but that can

39:19.900 --> 39:23.540
also just be the first place we look for him and we could all take separate routes to it.

39:23.540 --> 39:29.060
Do that and then split up if he's not at the hotel motel, then we can split up and cruise

39:29.060 --> 39:30.060
around.

39:30.060 --> 39:31.060
I like that.

39:31.060 --> 39:32.060
Yeah.

39:32.060 --> 39:33.060
And then figure it out from there.

39:33.060 --> 39:34.060
Cool.

39:34.060 --> 39:35.180
Uh, we do want to take all separate routes.

39:35.180 --> 39:36.180
Oh cool.

39:36.180 --> 39:40.340
Uh, and you're taking separate routes to look for this guy on the way to the establishment.

39:40.340 --> 39:44.660
Well, everybody, uh, how are we going to do this?

39:44.660 --> 39:48.180
Let's go ahead and get a luck roll from each of you first.

39:48.180 --> 39:49.180
Pass.

39:49.180 --> 39:51.180
20 on a 50.

39:51.180 --> 39:52.180
Uh, pass.

39:52.180 --> 39:54.180
51 on a 70.

39:54.180 --> 39:57.380
37 on a, what are we rolling?

39:57.380 --> 39:58.380
Luck.

39:58.380 --> 39:59.380
60.

39:59.380 --> 40:00.380
That's a lucky night.

40:00.580 --> 40:04.860
I need all three of you to roll search for me.

40:04.860 --> 40:05.860
Fail.

40:05.860 --> 40:06.860
Crit fail.

40:06.860 --> 40:07.860
We all.

40:07.860 --> 40:08.860
Perfect.

40:08.860 --> 40:18.820
We're all feeling really good and then each of you feels like you just missed him.

40:18.820 --> 40:21.340
I feel him in the night.

40:21.340 --> 40:22.420
Hot.

40:22.420 --> 40:28.380
As you all converge at hotel motel, Keith's current home, you arrive in the parking lot.

40:28.380 --> 40:31.460
It's midnight and there are a couple cars.

40:31.460 --> 40:35.700
If I could get an intelligence roll from the person with the highest intelligence, I'm

40:35.700 --> 40:41.980
at a 55, 75, 50, 92 on a 75.

40:41.980 --> 40:44.140
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.

40:44.140 --> 40:45.420
Another night at hotel motel.

40:45.420 --> 40:48.420
Do I recognize any of the cars from living there?

40:48.420 --> 40:53.060
Seems to you like all the ones that are normally there, there there's, you know, eight, 10

40:53.060 --> 40:54.060
cars there.

40:54.060 --> 40:55.060
There's some new ones.

40:55.060 --> 40:57.300
Do we have a room number and the keys to the room?

40:57.300 --> 41:00.540
You have your keys to your room and to Charles's.

41:00.540 --> 41:03.200
You also have the key to Charles room.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.200
What is my room number?

41:04.200 --> 41:05.200
What's his room number?

41:05.200 --> 41:06.200
What's your room number?

41:06.200 --> 41:07.200
One Oh eight.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.200
Cool.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.200
What do you guys think?

41:09.200 --> 41:11.060
Do you think that the room number would be on the key?

41:11.060 --> 41:16.140
I mean, depends on what kind of key it is, but if it's a real key, it's a real key.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.140
Then yeah.

41:17.140 --> 41:22.400
It's a real key with a rubber little thing on it that says two Oh two.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.620
Welcome to my home guys.

41:23.620 --> 41:25.220
This is a real shit hole.

41:25.220 --> 41:26.940
I thought you would never come visit me.

41:26.940 --> 41:28.820
It was very sad that you live here.

41:28.820 --> 41:29.820
It's just temporary.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.500
You've been saying that for months.

41:31.500 --> 41:35.980
I like try not to get a lump in my throat and go up to two Oh two.

41:35.980 --> 41:36.980
I know the way guys.

41:36.980 --> 41:58.940
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you heaven knows how
