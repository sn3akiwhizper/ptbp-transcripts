00:00.000 --> 00:07.280
What's good, my friends? Y'all want to know what's really good? Your boy Wolf the dog sure does

00:07.720 --> 00:14.960
What's really good is me being your host on the greatest show in the known and unknown universe

00:15.680 --> 00:19.400
six nine four point two PTBP

00:20.720 --> 00:26.660
The only show that will let y'all know what's really going on in all the dimensions

00:27.060 --> 00:31.540
Suck it NPR. What do you fools even know about the 27th dimension?

00:32.620 --> 00:38.640
Speaking of other dimensions this week's howling with wolf comes from Justin Jay from the Twitter

00:38.980 --> 00:45.420
Dimension who tagged that pretending pod in a tweet about benching the whole show in four days. Whoa

00:45.940 --> 00:49.480
Hell yeah, Justin Jay on Twitter. They write

00:49.620 --> 00:53.740
Hey wolf long time listener first time howler

00:53.740 --> 00:56.580
I wanted to give a shout out to my best friend Dan

00:56.660 --> 01:02.940
Well best friend besides my wife your taste in music and games and podcast is unparalleled

01:03.300 --> 01:07.880
And I'm glad I could turn you on to the adventures of our boys and contention

01:07.880 --> 01:14.460
You're also an invaluable asset and we couldn't make our show without you. What show you ask?

01:14.640 --> 01:21.220
Well, if y'all want more supernatural nonsense in your lives, you should check out the cryptid cases

01:21.300 --> 01:25.900
See you Friday, probably hell yeah, Justin Jay from Twitter

01:25.940 --> 01:31.580
Thanks for writing about the show and spreading the good word of the fine folks of PTBP

01:32.060 --> 01:34.060
I like your name

01:34.500 --> 01:40.380
Justin it reminds me of a name I once had in a past life in another dimension

01:40.900 --> 01:46.740
I look forward to seeing you Friday probably but you will not see me on Friday

01:47.700 --> 01:54.300
Probably I like to hang out from afar usually using some binoculars or telescopes just

01:54.780 --> 01:55.860
watching

01:55.860 --> 01:58.940
Waiting until the time is just right

02:00.740 --> 02:05.780
Remember if you want to write up something for your wolf the how tag at pretending pod on

02:05.940 --> 02:13.540
Instagram or Twitter tag pretending to be people on Facebook or write a five-star review and email us at pretending pod at gmail.com

02:14.540 --> 02:18.320

02:29.140 --> 02:32.460
hardback slip case set of Delta green the role-playing game

02:32.820 --> 02:40.060
Check out all the gorgeous entries on the thread so far as they are all stunning in their own delightful ways

02:41.020 --> 02:43.020
Gorgeous stunning

02:43.140 --> 02:47.620
Delightful it can't be but it is it's the news

02:48.740 --> 02:50.420
with Keith vigna

02:50.420 --> 02:58.620
Unconscious Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore took turns tossing grenades into the maw of the atrociously massive fish person creature

02:59.180 --> 03:03.300
Doug Jacobs in the body of agent Trent Chad was

03:03.820 --> 03:06.420
decapitated by the scythe of a fishy humanoid

03:06.820 --> 03:13.440
This same gamey bipedal amphibian then lodged that scythe into the skull of Kathy piston

03:13.580 --> 03:20.860
John Lee Kevin Moore was swallowed whole by Big Daddy fish monster, but swam through the whole Keith made previously

03:21.380 --> 03:28.700
However, an unseen force dragged his body down to the bottom of the tank up against the glass of that

03:29.340 --> 03:35.940
gargantuan aquarium in Kevin Lee Pettymore made direct eye contact with Marvin glass as

03:36.460 --> 03:38.460
lungs filled with water

03:38.900 --> 03:46.520
Like the lead singer the pussycat dolls once said don't hold your breath. It's kudzu with no backbone, baby

04:06.420 --> 04:08.420
Oh

04:09.940 --> 04:13.500
My mama made me miss my M&Ms. Oh my

04:15.020 --> 04:20.280
Hey Clark, hey Joe, you can you can call me Clark you can call me Clark

04:21.100 --> 04:23.100
Clark you are

04:23.220 --> 04:29.260
Standing on the wet catwalk above this murky water in this dank room

04:29.540 --> 04:34.700
Keith vigna is in your arms and in front of you both is the lone

04:35.620 --> 04:37.620
Standing fish man

04:38.220 --> 04:41.460
Just previously the giant monstrosity

04:42.460 --> 04:47.180
That is in the deep and four times bigger than the normal fish man

04:47.900 --> 04:52.660
swallowed John Lee Pettymore John Lee Kevin more hole and

04:53.660 --> 04:56.420
Then dove into the depths below

04:58.020 --> 05:03.700
We are still in combat and shit it is the top of the order which means

05:04.740 --> 05:06.740
It is Clark Bishop's turn

05:07.060 --> 05:09.900
Looking down into the water. Can I see big fish boy?

05:09.900 --> 05:15.020
Or is he just completely out of sight at this point completely out of sight at this point? Okay

05:15.020 --> 05:18.340
I'm going to take a shot at the fish man in front of me

05:18.500 --> 05:23.820
Go ahead and roll firearms as you kind of back up with Keith vigna in your arms

05:23.820 --> 05:30.340
You are backing into a part of the catwalk that has been ripped down by the giant monstrosity

05:30.340 --> 05:35.180
So there's water behind you. Do you roll a successful firearms check?

05:35.180 --> 05:40.300
I did a 13 on an 80. All right, go ahead and roll a d10 for me for damage

05:41.660 --> 05:46.420
For all right, so there's no catwalk behind me at all. No, it has been ripped down

05:46.940 --> 05:53.580
Could I make a maneuver across that corner? You would have to roll an athletics check at a negative 20%

05:54.620 --> 05:59.580
Because you're holding on to Keith vigna. I would give you a negative 40 but Keith vigna

06:00.060 --> 06:05.100
He's a rubbery guy. He's pretty easy to hold on to I don't feel like I can risk it

06:05.100 --> 06:07.900
So I'll just wait and see what happens. All righty

06:07.900 --> 06:13.420
But it's the fish man that's in front of me is blocking my way us ostensibly ostensibly

06:13.420 --> 06:16.500
He is even though he's on the opposite side of the elevator door

06:17.100 --> 06:21.260
He is still blocking your way because behind you in between you in the elevator door

06:21.740 --> 06:27.200
It's just this torn down catwalk and you're not sure if you jump down into it with a couple

06:27.360 --> 06:29.360
Feet of water up on to your knees

06:29.880 --> 06:35.440
It might break all the way off and fall into the depths plunge below

06:36.320 --> 06:38.320
so it is this

06:39.160 --> 06:46.720
It looks like a human. Honestly, it does it looks like a human person that has been genetically modified or

06:47.280 --> 06:50.200
grown and birthed in some

06:50.920 --> 06:55.440
Unnatural way to make them look like this and sure your everyday monstrosity

06:56.040 --> 07:00.440
Exactly, and this everyday monstrosity is coming at you with a massive scythe

07:01.280 --> 07:04.840
And it fails its rule. Thank God

07:04.960 --> 07:11.560
So it kind of lunges toward you and you move just right out of the way as it comes for you and it's back to

07:11.560 --> 07:15.880
You it's just gonna go back and forth here. Oh for real. Yes, sir. So what would you like to do?

07:15.880 --> 07:22.240
What are damage mechanics if I wanted to use that scythe against him

07:22.240 --> 07:26.640
Could I use an unarmed combat to take that flail at me and turn it on him?

07:26.640 --> 07:28.640
I think we've done that before. Yeah, actually

07:29.200 --> 07:36.960
You can you can absolutely do that. Yes. Okay, I'm gonna show that would mean you're gonna basically do unarmed combat

07:36.960 --> 07:38.960
Okay against him. So go ahead and roll that. I

07:39.960 --> 07:41.960
I

07:42.960 --> 07:49.080
Pass a 38 on a 70 he's gonna try to fight back and he failed with a 91 fuck

07:49.080 --> 07:55.640
yeah, so what you're gonna do is it with this you can take control of his scythe and

07:56.520 --> 08:03.320
Do damage with it. So that damage is a d8 plus two. So go ahead and roll that for me. Oh, dude

08:03.320 --> 08:05.780
I don't think I have a d8 sitting out. Do you I have a d8?

08:06.540 --> 08:11.620
It's one of the nice metal ones that you gave me sweet. I hope it rolls an eight

08:12.740 --> 08:14.740
It fucking did

08:16.580 --> 08:22.780
Yeah, that is it had six hit points left with fuck two armor

08:25.340 --> 08:31.300
You take it just down to zero do you want to describe how you take control of this fish man's

08:31.700 --> 08:39.140
Main weapon and take it down when he came swinging at me and he totally whiffed in the air my gun hand I

08:39.740 --> 08:46.780
Reached out and wrapped my arm around at that peg or that the stick of the scythe. Absolutely and just lunge forward

08:47.180 --> 08:53.340
I was probably wanting to aim as high as I could to decapitate but we'll see how high that got me

08:53.460 --> 08:55.920
It got him like maybe oh it goes

08:55.920 --> 08:57.600
It goes straight

08:57.600 --> 09:04.220
Straight through one of its gills on the side of its neck and you actually see a the scythe goes

09:04.520 --> 09:10.160
Into the gills and comes out of the fish man's mouth with the human teeth

09:10.640 --> 09:17.520
And so the point of the scythe is coming out through its big smile. That's a nice little kung-fu move. I put on that boy

09:18.720 --> 09:21.560
And as you do that it falls

09:22.440 --> 09:26.980
Onto the catwalk next to you and you are standing in this

09:27.760 --> 09:29.080
murky

09:29.080 --> 09:31.080
damp dank

09:31.540 --> 09:36.200
prison torture chamber aquatic mess by yourself

09:37.360 --> 09:42.000
Keith vigna is in your arms. You did all that with him like as a puppet and

09:42.760 --> 09:44.920
Like a marionette like in front of you

09:45.320 --> 09:47.080
Yeah

09:47.080 --> 09:53.480
Are we still in combat orders do I need to know and as you stand there kind of reeling from this

09:54.320 --> 09:56.320
you feel a

09:56.800 --> 10:02.280
Rumble from beneath and looking down you see this massive explosion

10:02.560 --> 10:09.100
Happen deep down in the water and the bubbles start coming and they don't stop coming

10:10.020 --> 10:15.460
John Lee Pettymore got fed to the fish and he hit the ground running did him. All right, so

10:16.460 --> 10:21.060
as these bubbles are hitting top of the water so to a

10:22.660 --> 10:24.920
Massive fish side

10:27.020 --> 10:30.860
Humanoid flank of fish flank of fish

10:32.860 --> 10:35.980
Floats to the top of the water

10:36.260 --> 10:40.540
That's either a really good sign or a really bad and then on the other side of you

10:40.980 --> 10:46.560
You see the bottom half of this monstrosity with its weird legs

10:46.860 --> 10:50.700
Fused together and it's tight tight genitals

10:51.860 --> 10:53.860
in between and

10:53.980 --> 11:00.720
Next to it. You see the bottom half of George piston and the top half of George piston

11:00.720 --> 11:02.240
I

11:02.240 --> 11:06.320
Said that's an okay half to see as far as knowing that John's down there

11:06.840 --> 11:10.160
And I need you to roll a sanity check. Oh shit

11:16.960 --> 11:25.120
I do not pass. It's a 30 on a 16. Okay. I need you to go down to 15 losing one sanity and

11:26.080 --> 11:28.840
you just break down in this room and

11:29.560 --> 11:33.720
As you're standing there holding the body of Keith Wigner

11:34.200 --> 11:36.640
crying as a God

11:37.360 --> 11:39.200
Who has failed?

11:39.200 --> 11:40.480
ding

11:40.480 --> 11:42.780
The elevator door opens up

11:46.600 --> 11:48.600
Oh, do you want it to be empty

11:49.920 --> 11:51.920
Did you think it would be empty

11:52.360 --> 11:57.160
a little afraid of getting at all this and then fighting some in an elevator, so

11:57.480 --> 12:00.920
I guess we'll see what's happening. It's empty. Oh

12:03.000 --> 12:09.280
Thank God is Keith in my arms do I think he's dead as I'm holding him or do I know that he's

12:10.080 --> 12:12.840
Unconscious or whatever roll a first aid check. Okay. Oh

12:17.080 --> 12:19.000
Fuck

12:19.000 --> 12:23.040
Shit at 38 on a 30. All right, so close he is

12:24.700 --> 12:26.700
Super dead

12:27.160 --> 12:29.040
I

12:29.040 --> 12:31.040
Drop him in the water

12:32.360 --> 12:35.040
Burial at sea. No, I'm not gonna drop him in the water

12:35.040 --> 12:39.720
I'm gonna try I want to get to the elevator and I just want to throw him between

12:40.120 --> 12:44.560
The threshold like over the threshold so that the doors can't close. Okay, it keeps the elevator there

12:44.560 --> 12:49.320
You're doing this and then I want to go back to what the last place I saw John Lee Pettymore

12:49.320 --> 12:55.600
Is it in the same place that the now body has reemerged resurfaced or is it in a different area now the?

12:56.600 --> 13:02.800
There's not a current in here so everything that floated to the top is where it was earlier

13:03.560 --> 13:05.360
Is that what you asked essentially?

13:05.360 --> 13:09.680
I was wondering if the when the when the big guy got him did he swim away with him?

13:09.760 --> 13:11.760
Seems like you went straight down. Okay

13:12.480 --> 13:17.840
Fuck there's other people hanging in this room. Yes. Do I a recognize any of them and B

13:17.840 --> 13:23.100
Can I tell if any of them are alive or actually I'm more looking for any of them that are already dead

13:23.180 --> 13:25.580
There's the nearest one to you is already dead

13:25.580 --> 13:31.100
The other three seem to be unconscious that you can see but one is like very clearly

13:31.740 --> 13:32.940
skin

13:32.940 --> 13:40.340
dilapidating to the point of the fish hook has ripped its way from the middle of the forearm all the way up to the

13:40.340 --> 13:45.420
Hands and it's just hanging clearly by bones at this point

13:45.600 --> 13:50.220
Yeah, I was thinking I was gonna use him to like see if there were other monsters in the water

13:50.220 --> 13:56.540
But I'm nervous about time with that if John Lee Pettymore is still alive and under the surface

13:56.540 --> 13:58.820
I think I'm going to have to

13:59.580 --> 14:01.220
dive in

14:01.220 --> 14:04.500
And look for him. Okay. How do I do that?

14:05.820 --> 14:12.160
You dive in Clark takes off his contention uniform and he's in his tidy whiteies off to do so amazing

14:12.500 --> 14:16.820
Alright, are you bringing anything? Are you bringing the the scythe with you? Yeah

14:17.820 --> 14:20.260
Yeah, that's not gonna leave my side for as long as I can keep it

14:22.500 --> 14:25.300
That's a cool weapon of destruction right there

14:27.100 --> 14:28.220
All right

14:28.220 --> 14:30.220
according to the rules you have

14:30.540 --> 14:35.700
Con times five rounds if you take a full breath before you jump in

14:35.980 --> 14:39.340
So you have a shitload of rounds? Yeah, that's a lot

14:39.340 --> 14:45.680
So I am going to I also have that thing that makes it so that my con is extra high

14:45.680 --> 14:48.320
Oh my gosh. Yeah, so you have plenty of time

14:48.320 --> 14:52.980
Yeah, so if your search is above a 40 you'll find what you're looking for

14:53.120 --> 15:00.060
But if it's not if it's a 40 or below then I'll have you roll search. So what is your search skill?

15:00.060 --> 15:05.180
I don't have any in search. So I have the baseline of 20. Okay, so you'll need to roll. Okay

15:07.600 --> 15:09.600
Shit

15:09.600 --> 15:11.600
Oh

15:12.160 --> 15:16.680
Zach you want to take a picture of this? I rolled it. I rolled a 19

15:20.080 --> 15:26.780
My god, I rolled a fucking 19 on a 20. I'm like shaking

15:26.780 --> 15:28.780
Hahaha

15:33.260 --> 15:40.640
Joe Terry's ability to roll successes in the most dire of situations keeps me on my toes as a GM more than

15:41.140 --> 15:42.920
anything else

15:42.920 --> 15:50.260
More than Luke just like claiming that things exist like more than Thomas doing jokes like

15:50.820 --> 15:55.780
your ability to roll successes when you have nothing in the skill is

15:56.220 --> 16:01.380
Mind-blowing that that was incredible. I literally have an adrenaline surge right now

16:02.980 --> 16:06.020
Joe Clark is swimming through this murkiness and

16:07.340 --> 16:09.340
swimming and swimming and

16:09.820 --> 16:13.800
You're trying to find anything but the water is so

16:14.260 --> 16:18.660
So opaque with how dirty and disgusting it is every once in a while

16:18.660 --> 16:25.020
You find these pockets of like cool water that are a little bit easier to see through but for the most part

16:25.180 --> 16:26.860
it is

16:26.860 --> 16:30.540
Impossible to see more than a foot in front of your face down here

16:30.740 --> 16:34.380
but all of a sudden you reach out and you feel

16:38.020 --> 16:40.020
Clothes

16:40.380 --> 16:45.420
And you feel the body of John Lee Pettymore in front of you and

16:45.940 --> 16:50.620
Continuing to reach for it. You see he is pressed up against glass

16:51.220 --> 16:53.720
Some sort of a wall here. What do you want to do?

16:53.900 --> 16:59.820
You're on the other side of John Lee Pettymore from this glass as you swim up are my eyes open enough underwater that I can

16:59.820 --> 17:05.460
See him at this point. Yes, are his eyes open or closed? He is faced away from you and he seems to be

17:05.980 --> 17:09.620
Forcibly pushed up against this glass. Oh shit

17:10.140 --> 17:12.140
Can I run a hand?

17:12.420 --> 17:14.260
Kind of toward the front of him

17:14.260 --> 17:18.100
Here's Joe's theory and probably Clark's too is that maybe he's being

17:18.180 --> 17:21.940
Suctioned into that window because there's a hole in it and the water is trying to be rushed out

17:22.100 --> 17:27.300
So can I feel that hole if there is one you feel all the way down? I'm gonna roll

17:28.100 --> 17:30.100
dice I

17:31.980 --> 17:36.140
Need you to roll stealth as I roll something else

17:37.820 --> 17:39.820
I've got a 30 in that I

17:41.940 --> 17:47.020
Got a 36 on a 30 so I fail I'm not gonna tell you what I rolled fuck

17:48.340 --> 17:50.740
Fuck but I rolled dice

17:53.140 --> 17:58.000
So, but so I just I don't feel that hole right you do not feel a hole

17:58.000 --> 18:01.120
Okay as you run your hand, but you do feel pressure

18:02.740 --> 18:09.420
Pulling his body up against this glass. Can I get my face closer to the glass and maybe see what's on the other side?

18:09.660 --> 18:14.460
Yes, you can what lastly looking on the other side of the glass

18:15.020 --> 18:20.580
You push your face up against it and open up your eyes in this disgusting water and

18:21.420 --> 18:23.420
You see a large

18:23.940 --> 18:28.100
office and in the middle of this office, there's a desk and

18:28.960 --> 18:31.940
Marvin Glass is standing at this desk

18:32.940 --> 18:38.980
Holding up a picture in his hand and he's showing it to Rosemary

18:39.140 --> 18:41.940
who's standing on the other side of the desk and

18:42.540 --> 18:45.060
He is like shaking it in her face and

18:46.300 --> 18:49.620
With his other hand. He is holding it out

18:50.540 --> 18:55.880
Toward the glass toward you toward John Lee petty more

18:56.580 --> 19:03.300
Fuck so I'm pressed against the glass and I'm seeing that can I look like down as if I were looking down at myself and see

19:03.300 --> 19:07.780
If there's any water coming out of where John is there's there's not right? There's not okay

19:07.820 --> 19:14.900
I'm gonna try and pull him away from the glass and see what happens. Okay, I need you to roll strength. Okay. Okay, okay. I

19:18.620 --> 19:26.060
Pass a 32 on a 65 as you pull at John Lee petty Moore's body you feel

19:27.260 --> 19:29.260
Absolutely, no change

19:29.740 --> 19:34.660
You feel it is as if you are trying to pull a statue

19:35.260 --> 19:39.340
Away from its place on the ground or trying to pull a

19:39.940 --> 19:45.820
Car to the side with your hands. Like it's just not gonna move not gonna budge

19:47.180 --> 19:53.580
Fuck does Kevin John have any grenades left on him? No. Yeah, I didn't think so. I don't think I could do either

19:54.380 --> 19:58.840
I'm afraid to ask a question because the you'll think about it. It'll be no

19:59.360 --> 20:04.300
Can I fire my gun underwater in real life? I don't think you can I don't think so

20:04.540 --> 20:10.020
Right. I don't think you can I think there are guns in this world that you can fire underwater

20:10.060 --> 20:15.060
But I don't think that you're like service pistol is one of them. Fuck

20:15.620 --> 20:19.480
Can I get a sense of how far down below the catwalks?

20:19.480 --> 20:25.060
I have traveled to find the John Lee petty Moore's body against the glass role intelligence for me. I

20:27.260 --> 20:31.740
Pass a 20 on a 55 like 40 meters. It's pretty deep

20:34.340 --> 20:40.080
I want to roll first aid to see if John Lee petty Moore is actually alive or not

20:40.100 --> 20:43.260
Okay, reach for that pulse while you roll first aid. I

20:46.180 --> 20:52.940
Pass five on a 30 John Lee petty Moore's heart is no longer beating

20:56.220 --> 21:00.060
He's kind of robot II though, I don't know if he needs a heart anymore I

21:01.060 --> 21:04.460
Don't have a heart you wouldn't find a heartbeat on me and I'm dandy

21:07.540 --> 21:09.740
And that's why you don't have to roll sanity

21:12.820 --> 21:17.180
I'm kind of at a loss here. Here's what I think I'm gonna try because I've got such good

21:17.740 --> 21:21.360
underwater swimming skills that I've just made up just now

21:22.940 --> 21:25.420
Can I swim up to the top here's what I want to do

21:25.420 --> 21:27.340
I'll tell you the whole action that I want to hit me with it

21:27.340 --> 21:30.380
So I want to swim back up to the top jump onto the catwalk run over to

21:30.580 --> 21:34.540
Keith's body and try and find his strong tiny powerful gun

21:34.540 --> 21:39.020
I want to run back to the edge of the catwalk and shoot down where I last was

21:39.180 --> 21:44.900
Trying to break the glass into into glasses office. I want to break the glass into glasses office so that it floods

21:45.980 --> 21:49.260
Okay, give me any and all roles I need to do to make that happen

21:57.900 --> 21:59.900
This is gonna be good

22:02.580 --> 22:05.180
You swim back down you got that

22:05.900 --> 22:07.060
insane

22:07.060 --> 22:14.500
Constitution and we'll say that you you felt your way around to figure out like where you were on the catwalk

22:14.500 --> 22:16.500
So you get up on the catwalk?

22:16.820 --> 22:18.820
Still like empty in here

22:18.820 --> 22:26.180
Just these unconscious and maybe dead bodies hanging in the background as you walk over to the body of Keith Vigna

22:26.540 --> 22:32.540
Which is halfway into the elevator and the elevator door is like as you're walking up. It's like going. Yeah

22:32.820 --> 22:34.820
It just keeps hitting

22:35.300 --> 22:37.300
And he's losing a hit point every time

22:41.340 --> 22:43.340
He killed John Lee Pettymore

22:46.020 --> 22:48.740
What else can you do it sounds like Clark's winning

22:49.740 --> 22:51.740
Clark won the game. So

22:52.180 --> 22:54.300
This was player versus player the whole time

22:55.180 --> 22:57.180
You guys knew that right? Yeah

22:57.380 --> 23:02.460
So you go over and you grab this small powerful pistol off of Keith's belt

23:03.020 --> 23:05.780
Or inside his massive cargo shorts rather

23:06.460 --> 23:11.100
Yeah, you drop back down into the water. What are you doing?

23:11.100 --> 23:16.860
You're diving down with this gun still in your whitey-tities drenched from head to toe walking on the catwalk

23:17.380 --> 23:20.740
The image of this is fantastic. I love it, too

23:20.740 --> 23:26.340
I so in my quick explanation, I said I was gonna shoot from the catwalk. Oh, I was trying on the cat

23:26.340 --> 23:32.900
I was trying to avoid the waterlogged gun issue. Gotcha with his powerful gun to maybe help with the extra distance

23:32.900 --> 23:38.660
Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Go ahead and roll a roll a sanity check for me

23:38.660 --> 23:42.420
This wasn't to lose sanity. This is just to gauge a

23:42.780 --> 23:44.780
a

23:44.940 --> 23:46.300
Feeling oh my god

23:46.300 --> 23:53.420
I pass a 12 on a 15 now's an interesting time to pass a sanity check when it when it doesn't matter

23:54.700 --> 23:56.700
for losing sanity points

23:57.180 --> 24:04.820
Yeah, you you fully you look at this gun you say no. No all guns can't fire underwater. I'm sure

24:04.820 --> 24:06.820
And

24:10.620 --> 24:17.180
That's gonna be a boon to you in the future so okay describe what you're doing here

24:17.180 --> 24:19.180
I'm going back to the edge

24:27.980 --> 24:29.980
To the wall and

24:30.260 --> 24:35.640
The sweat is dripping down your balls as you fire making the bitches crawl

24:37.700 --> 24:39.700
All right, so you ski ski motherfucker

24:44.420 --> 24:49.000
And when you fire the very first time you fire you see a crack

24:49.860 --> 24:53.740
Do you continue to fire? Yes. Yes. Yes, I do

24:54.620 --> 24:56.620
You continue firing?

24:56.980 --> 24:58.500
until a

24:58.500 --> 24:59.780
leak

24:59.780 --> 25:06.220
Begins and then all of a sudden you see the spiderweb of cracks

25:07.020 --> 25:10.780
Grow so quickly across this entire

25:11.740 --> 25:16.580
Wall and in one swift movement all the glass

25:19.940 --> 25:25.380
Breaks out and all of this water starts rushing into the room

25:26.340 --> 25:29.740
Where you saw Marvin glass and Rosemary

25:32.180 --> 25:40.100
Fuck yeah, you're still standing on this catwalk. What do you do as the water presumably starts lowering because it's being rushed into that room

25:40.100 --> 25:46.260
Yeah, can I see better what's happening in that room from where I am? I'm specifically looking to see if

25:46.820 --> 25:49.000
John's body is being swept in with it

25:49.000 --> 25:55.880
And I'm specifically looking to see where Marvin has ended up or is or is ending up or is maybe running

25:55.880 --> 26:03.160
I don't know. That's really interesting because when you look down into this next room over as you will you see

26:03.960 --> 26:05.960
Marvin glass and

26:06.120 --> 26:07.480
rosemary

26:07.480 --> 26:09.800
Marvin glass has his hands up and

26:10.480 --> 26:17.560
His desk is still right in front of him. It's at standing height. He doesn't sit at his desk. It's a standing desk

26:17.560 --> 26:19.400
he's trying to be healthy and

26:19.400 --> 26:21.600
He is holding himself

26:22.360 --> 26:24.360
the desk and

26:24.400 --> 26:25.480
rosemary

26:25.480 --> 26:33.440
Above the water as it's rushing in below him and as the water settles into like us one level

26:33.760 --> 26:38.480
Covering the floor of both of these rooms these very very large rooms

26:39.440 --> 26:43.400
He holds a hand down and then he lowers himself

26:43.560 --> 26:50.800
And rosemary on to the top of the water and both of them are standing on the water

26:51.440 --> 26:54.000
You do not see the body of John lee petting more

26:55.440 --> 27:02.440
Roll stealth for me. Whoa. Whoa. Okay first roll sanity. Let's go ahead and do that. Okay

27:04.800 --> 27:06.800
I fail the sanity a

27:07.440 --> 27:13.440
35 on a 15. All right, you're gonna lose to sanity. All righty. I'm at 13 now

27:13.440 --> 27:19.440
I need you what is your stealth at I'm gonna give you a negative for losing that sanity. I've got a 30 in stealth

27:19.440 --> 27:22.360
Okay. Well, I'm giving you a negative 40. So

27:22.960 --> 27:24.960
No need to roll here. I guess

27:25.240 --> 27:31.840
Actually, go ahead and roll. Let's see if your dice match and if the dice match no matter what it's a critical fail

27:32.680 --> 27:34.680
Oh boy

27:34.760 --> 27:36.760
The dice do not match

27:36.920 --> 27:44.320
It's a 49. It's a regular fail as Marvin glass whips his head up and makes direct eye contact

27:44.800 --> 27:46.800
with you

27:52.480 --> 27:54.480
I hurt my side though

27:55.480 --> 27:57.480
my rib hit my

27:57.480 --> 27:59.480
Oh

27:59.880 --> 28:05.280
Something something feels bad. That's a heck of a scream. Oh god, you ruptured your appendix

28:07.720 --> 28:10.680
Heartbreaking I need you to roll power for me

28:12.280 --> 28:15.920
Okay, okay, it's a contest, okay

28:18.160 --> 28:22.200
God I pass but it's really low I pass with a six

28:22.200 --> 28:23.800
He

28:23.800 --> 28:28.840
Actually passed with a nine nice Wow a six and a nine

28:30.480 --> 28:32.880
You feel your entire body sees

28:33.440 --> 28:38.600
you no longer have control and he lifts up his hand and

28:38.880 --> 28:43.880
in one swift movement, like do you remember when you were in the

28:44.480 --> 28:48.740
Cemetery and that creature just moved into position

28:49.460 --> 28:54.160
You do that and all of a sudden you are standing in front of Marvin glass

28:55.500 --> 28:58.820
You're standing on the water and you are standing on

28:59.660 --> 29:05.220
The water I can feel my weight in my shoes and standing on it. Yes, you can. Oh my god, that's cool

29:05.220 --> 29:07.540
I need you to roll another sanity check for me

29:09.740 --> 29:10.900
Because

29:10.900 --> 29:17.620
You just changed locations so quickly fail 80. Oh fuck. It's a fail above my power

29:18.220 --> 29:25.140
85 what do you want to do here Clark as a god who is standing on water now?

29:25.140 --> 29:27.140
Who is now standing on water?

29:27.820 --> 29:35.160
If he's still got me held I can't do anything but that for for describing what's going on in inside Clark's head

29:35.160 --> 29:38.300
he would we he'd be freaking the fuck out and

29:38.900 --> 29:40.340
wanting to

29:40.340 --> 29:42.620
Wanting to rip Marvin in the limb from limb. He would be

29:43.340 --> 29:49.300
He would be fighting with every fiber of his body to get out of the hole that whatever Marvin has on him and

29:50.100 --> 29:56.340
Shoving the small but powerful pistol into his fucking mouth. Yeah, it looks really sad because you can't do any of that

29:56.340 --> 30:02.060
Yeah, we can see on your face how badly you want to so as far as these disorders go

30:02.060 --> 30:09.540
I mean that would probably like it would be fucking up his brain from the inside. Yes, I would be I would be melting in

30:09.700 --> 30:13.580
Inward to not be able to express what I'm feeling right now

30:16.100 --> 30:21.100
All right, well, uh, we'll stop there for now I'm gonna go grab Luke oh shit

30:31.740 --> 30:35.980
Luke yes, Keith Vigno is unconscious. Yeah, I

30:36.580 --> 30:38.580
I just saw some stuff

30:41.220 --> 30:48.020
Luke Keith Vigna's eyes open and they're staring into black darkness

30:49.060 --> 30:51.060
just pure obsidian

30:52.060 --> 30:54.740
Reflection looking back down at you

30:55.380 --> 30:59.020
And you notice that you have been jammed

30:59.800 --> 31:04.260
halfway into this elevator and the elevators doors are

31:05.100 --> 31:09.860
Closing on you just like close open close open close

31:10.820 --> 31:15.920
Open and you feel on your chest where you got just shredded

31:16.560 --> 31:18.180
earlier

31:18.180 --> 31:22.860
You feel a bit of walking around and you hear

31:24.020 --> 31:27.980
Hey friend, I'm almost done. I'm almost done taking care of you

31:27.980 --> 31:34.260
Are you gonna I hope that you're feeling better and you gain four hit points? Oh, yeah

31:34.260 --> 31:39.380
I think you were at two hit points when you went is right. So you're up to six hit points now and

31:40.060 --> 31:47.580
looking down you see that Peter Dieter is spitting his like weird saliva all over you and then like

31:47.860 --> 31:52.500
Using his little human hands to like close up your wounds

31:53.140 --> 31:54.860
basically a tear

31:54.860 --> 32:01.660
Falls down what my right eye and I just say you don't know how good it is to see you

32:01.660 --> 32:06.700
I never thought I'd see you again. I'm glad I could I'm glad I could save you my friend

32:06.700 --> 32:10.260
It's really it's really nice to see a friend again. I was inside of

32:11.420 --> 32:18.160
Darkness for a long time and it was really gross in there and I just I hated it. There were all these

32:18.920 --> 32:24.680
Are these bad friends, you know, yeah, they kept coming in and they were all very

32:25.440 --> 32:32.320
Very standoffish. How did you get out? I swam there was a there's a lot of water rushing

32:32.320 --> 32:34.320
And I just went with the current

32:34.520 --> 32:35.000
Okay

32:35.000 --> 32:35.400
Yeah

32:35.400 --> 32:41.080
As you as you look down you actually see the water in this room

32:41.160 --> 32:45.480
This room that you've just been trapped in for some time. The water is

32:46.040 --> 32:49.160
Much lower than it was before like

32:50.160 --> 32:57.600
40 meters lower. Okay than it was before and looking down you see the wall on the right side is gone

32:57.880 --> 33:04.120
Which is where you think that aquarium class was so it appears to have been

33:04.640 --> 33:10.400
Probably broken it appears to have probably been broken are my eyes adjusting at all

33:10.400 --> 33:11.640
Is it getting a little less?

33:11.680 --> 33:15.700
Can I see a little better in here you can see a little bit better as you're coming to

33:15.960 --> 33:24.420
Consciousness and looking down you see that there was a room next to this room at a lower point and it is

33:25.280 --> 33:26.620
Marvin Glasses office

33:26.620 --> 33:30.520
but the floor is made entirely of water and

33:30.840 --> 33:37.120
Marvin Glass is standing on this water behind his platform podium like desk and

33:38.080 --> 33:40.080
across from him is

33:40.640 --> 33:42.240
Clark Bishop and

33:42.240 --> 33:48.760
Rose Mary do they see me I need you to roll stealth. What's Keith victim percent ten percent?

33:49.600 --> 33:51.600
Not a sneaky guy

33:52.320 --> 33:59.880
89 all right, would you like to spend 79 luck to make that a success? No, I can't and I wouldn't anyway

33:59.880 --> 34:01.880
All right with that

34:02.880 --> 34:05.960
Marvin Glass looks up at you. He is

34:06.720 --> 34:12.680
150 200 yards away, but you feel it when you look down you feel his eyes

34:13.240 --> 34:15.240
staring into you I want to

34:15.960 --> 34:18.020
crab walk backwards into the

34:18.740 --> 34:21.980
Into the elevator. I should roll power for me

34:25.320 --> 34:29.560
18 on a 50 I rolled a six

34:29.560 --> 34:32.660
Wait, it means you win. Yay

34:36.200 --> 34:42.800
All right, so what that means is as you back away you see in front of you Peter Deeter is

34:43.320 --> 34:51.280
Lifted off of you and goes flying down below as you scurry back into the elevator and the door closes

34:51.280 --> 34:57.160
Oh, I needed him roll sanity. I know you don't have empathy. No technically I

34:58.120 --> 35:01.680
Mean you do Luke feels bad, right?

35:01.680 --> 35:06.600
But Peter Deeter, I think Keith feels bad because Peter could have helped him

35:06.600 --> 35:11.880
But not I don't feel bad for not an emotional way, right? No, it's because you needed a

35:12.400 --> 35:16.240
Compatriot on you. I needed help. I didn't care about him necessarily. Yeah

35:18.120 --> 35:25.120
The door closes and you were in this elevator is there lighter is it also like just pitch black no, there's light in here

35:25.120 --> 35:29.600
It's as you've been in this elevator before and it looks very similar except for now

35:29.600 --> 35:34.600
It is wet because you are soaking wet and it is covered in your blood

35:34.600 --> 35:41.600
Yeah, so with his spit and whatnot has it patched up a little bit of the bleeding. Yes, it has. Okay, cool. I

35:42.200 --> 35:45.720
Stand up. Is there any thing else in here with me or is it just me?

35:45.720 --> 35:52.120
It is just you and the elevator begins moving backwards and then up and then across

35:52.160 --> 35:56.960
And then up like that Roald Dahl book just like that

35:57.280 --> 36:01.880
These schnoz berries don't taste anything like schnoz berries. Yeah

36:04.780 --> 36:05.960
So

36:05.960 --> 36:07.960
the elevator door opens

36:09.040 --> 36:11.040
into a lab and

36:11.320 --> 36:13.320
Looking around you can see these

36:13.640 --> 36:20.920
These clear dividing walls all over the place are covered in like Expo marker with all this crazy math

36:20.920 --> 36:26.400
All over this is not the one that I the lab that I came out of recently. No, it is not

36:26.840 --> 36:31.680
however, you see a familiar face inside this lab that is full of

36:32.440 --> 36:34.640
computers and magnets and all these

36:35.300 --> 36:42.720
electrical shit and there's a panel of television screens and there's a window into another room like a

36:42.840 --> 36:49.940
Like almost like an interrogation room like in the police station, but the room that's inside is completely covered in blood

36:50.920 --> 36:54.320
And the person that you see in this room is

36:55.160 --> 36:56.960
the scientist

36:56.960 --> 37:02.240
Dressed in the scientist lady. Yeah. Yeah, and she's dressed in this white lab coat

37:02.240 --> 37:06.220
And she's got the goggles and the hair going all crazy to top her head

37:07.080 --> 37:12.180
She's walking around and she looks up. She sees you she sees your hurt. She's like

37:14.000 --> 37:19.720
Well, what are you doing around here hey, I need your help with something you're Keith, right?

37:19.880 --> 37:21.880
We just fixed you up

37:21.960 --> 37:27.760
Yeah, I was sent on a mission by by Marvin and well, I came back to report to him what happened

37:27.760 --> 37:32.840
But I got in a little trouble. Oh, I don't I walk into the room

37:32.920 --> 37:39.300
I'm looking for my little fish friend. He was in that room where we fixed you up earlier

37:39.320 --> 37:42.600
He was in there, but oh, yeah, but he's not there now

37:42.600 --> 37:49.420
So I'm looking for him here in Francis's lab. Have you seen him cute little fella?

37:50.000 --> 37:51.280
well

37:51.280 --> 37:53.280
the mission Marvin sent me on

37:53.720 --> 37:58.480
Right before he did it. He uh, I think he tried to kill that little fish guy

37:58.480 --> 38:01.480
He sent him into the big aquarium down there. He

38:02.080 --> 38:05.720
somehow he put his fist through the glass and just let him go and

38:07.480 --> 38:08.800
There was some

38:08.800 --> 38:15.960
Much bigger fish in there that I don't know if he he would have made it or not. The scientists face just melts

38:16.560 --> 38:18.560
into the sad

38:19.360 --> 38:21.280
Placidity oh

38:21.280 --> 38:26.760
Okay, they make sense, but I don't know for sure. I didn't see him get eaten or anything

38:26.760 --> 38:32.320
He might still be swimming around in there. He might have escaped. I don't know. Can I do a human on her? Sure

38:32.320 --> 38:37.240
Yeah, I want to see if she's somebody that I can like trust to

38:37.800 --> 38:39.800
Information that I know, okay

38:40.000 --> 38:43.080
64 and an 80. All right. Yeah, she is

38:43.280 --> 38:48.040
She's really hurt by this to the point to where this is like crushing information

38:48.080 --> 38:50.200
I thought maybe you wanted to hurt him or something

38:50.200 --> 38:56.400
But I just got hurt up in a I was in a room over the over the water

38:56.640 --> 38:59.840
The aquarium or whatever is and yeah of the torch

38:59.840 --> 39:04.880
Yeah, I was in the torture chamber and I've gotten to a little skiff and I was hurt

39:04.880 --> 39:06.880
I was I got knocked out and I was a plea and

39:07.360 --> 39:14.040
With one of them prisoners. No one of the one of those fish men. I don't know why they were attacking me, but they did

39:15.040 --> 39:21.400
No, no, no, well, there's no way my boys would ever do well and I just show her

39:21.400 --> 39:26.360
you know the wounds that I have I'm like one of them did this and well

39:27.120 --> 39:32.120
Your little fish friend. I'm a nicknamed him Peter. I woke up to him

39:32.720 --> 39:37.600
Helping me out. I was about to die I think and he he healed me up real good

39:37.600 --> 39:41.240
But right before I got in the elevator, he got somehow got thrown off

39:41.520 --> 39:44.400
He might have got thrown down with Marvin Oh

39:45.080 --> 39:46.360
where

39:46.360 --> 39:52.440
Wait, how did he get to Marvin's office? There's not an entrance that well I saw him

39:52.440 --> 39:54.480
There's a lot less water in that aquarium

39:54.480 --> 39:59.400
now when I when I got knocked out it was almost up to where I was in the catwalk and

39:59.720 --> 40:04.760
Now there it's about you know hundreds of feet lower than it is now Oh

40:05.600 --> 40:07.600
Hundreds of well eat I

40:07.920 --> 40:11.560
Don't know. I was dark in there. It was a lot less water down in there

40:11.560 --> 40:18.800
I could see it was Marvin standing with a couple other people. Oh the the water flooded Marvin's office

40:18.800 --> 40:22.600
I guess if that's where Marvin hangs out at that's all I that's all I saw

40:22.600 --> 40:28.640
But was it if you think that he might be in the right when you walked in? Yeah. Oh, no

40:29.200 --> 40:35.080
I gotta get down there then. Oh, well, can I come with you? I saw I think I might have seen a I

40:36.680 --> 40:41.480
Don't know it's a if it's a friend or an enemy, but somebody that I recognize too. Yeah, I

40:42.380 --> 40:48.340
Absolutely. Let's go down there. Do you want to do anything before you leave? I would like to search the room. Yeah. All right

40:49.600 --> 40:51.600
Go ahead and roll search for me

40:51.600 --> 40:53.600
Oh

40:54.240 --> 40:59.480
38 on a 40 awesome. So as you're explaining all this and you guys are having this conversation

40:59.880 --> 41:02.280
you're looking around this room and

41:03.000 --> 41:05.880
Noting everything that is around you find all these

41:06.240 --> 41:11.880
VHS tapes lined up right next to the panel of screens next to a VHS player and

41:12.900 --> 41:20.040
you can see that this is footage you're guessing from the room that is covered in blood and

41:21.640 --> 41:27.840
When you're looking around at the math that it's all over these boards you would notice that is Francis's handwriting

41:28.020 --> 41:31.040
Hey before we leave what what went on in that room? Oh

41:32.160 --> 41:39.000
Yeah, and now this is where what Francis's job. I'll just tell you later. I want to

41:39.560 --> 41:46.120
Swipe one of the VHS tapes and put it. Oh, I can show you that later if you want

41:46.400 --> 41:51.400
You probably shouldn't take it with you I guess we could pop it in right now if you're there

41:51.400 --> 41:54.240
I would like to see it with my own eyes. Oh

41:55.000 --> 42:00.520
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be far better. Just seeing your face. Watch this

42:02.200 --> 42:06.200
So you put in this VHS tape and it's static on the

42:06.520 --> 42:14.000
screens in front of you and then you see it's security footage from the corner of this room and it's covered in blood and

42:14.960 --> 42:17.460
In the room there's a desk a

42:18.240 --> 42:22.920
Table and behind the table. There's a person standing and it's a

42:23.480 --> 42:28.800
it's a young man, and he is rail thin absolutely malnourished and

42:29.760 --> 42:32.660
Does it remind me of like a one of the cage fighting kids?

42:33.160 --> 42:40.600
Absolutely reminds you of one of the cage fighting kids and this kid reaches out in front and in front of him on the desk

42:40.760 --> 42:43.480
There is a small metal sphere

42:44.120 --> 42:46.120
and when

42:46.400 --> 42:49.940
He reaches out and grabs onto the sphere

42:50.840 --> 42:52.840
You see immediately

42:53.200 --> 42:58.320
multiple shiny limbs extend from this small metal sphere and

42:59.120 --> 43:02.080
Slam into the walls on either side

43:02.800 --> 43:08.320
giving it the leverage it needs to fling itself out of the hand of this young boy and

43:08.720 --> 43:10.720
up on top

43:11.240 --> 43:17.880
One of its appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of his neck and another snaps his head forward

43:18.560 --> 43:23.440
You can see a fracture as the third metal tendril reaches in

43:23.960 --> 43:26.440
Gripping the top of this young boy's spine

43:26.920 --> 43:30.920
Where it meets his head and it rips his entire

43:31.200 --> 43:37.120
Spinal cord out of his body in one swift motion and then it forces itself

43:37.840 --> 43:39.880
into the hole that it made

43:40.720 --> 43:42.120
and then all of a sudden

43:42.120 --> 43:47.160
The boy just starts running and slamming his head into the wall

43:47.720 --> 43:52.680
Repeatedly until he falls to the ground bleeding all over the room

43:57.680 --> 44:04.840
The scientist is laughing as she's watching you watch this. I need you to roll sanity for me. I don't think so

44:05.320 --> 44:11.520
Yeah, maybe the sanity is going to be for the the science fiction nature of right

44:11.520 --> 44:15.080
You just saw I don't I mine is really low

44:15.900 --> 44:19.060
Yeah, I rolled a 43 on 8 so alright

44:19.240 --> 44:25.620
You are going to lose to sanity taking you down to 6 sanity. Hold on

44:25.620 --> 44:32.200
So I got to my breaking point the last time that's why oh wait, that's why you have the way I have that

44:32.240 --> 44:37.240
I don't think I ever changed what my next breaking point was. You don't have one. I'm joking

44:37.240 --> 44:42.680
Yeah, your next your next breaking point will be zero in which case you lose your mind completely

44:43.760 --> 44:45.240
Cool, cool

44:45.240 --> 44:47.480
That'll be fun. Yeah, super fun

44:48.520 --> 44:54.640
So I think Keith, you know not too much bothered by the violent aspect of it

44:54.640 --> 44:59.480
But seeing that metal ball turn into some sort of weird

45:00.080 --> 45:03.160
Silver monster thing and seeing that happen and

45:03.680 --> 45:09.420
I asked her I'm like, is this what is on all of these videotapes? Oh, yeah

45:09.560 --> 45:12.720
We're trying to figure out what's the deal with the metal balls?

45:12.840 --> 45:20.200
Is that so every time you is any time somebody touches one of those metal balls that happens but she nods her head and her hair

45:20.400 --> 45:22.400
Frantically fucks the top. I've

45:22.640 --> 45:29.340
I've seen one of these before and I've seen somebody touch it and that doesn't happen you did what now you saw what?

45:29.480 --> 45:33.400
I've seen one of those before and well who had it? Where was it from?

45:34.280 --> 45:38.760
We can get into it later after we go rescue your fish friend. Let's talk while we walk

45:38.760 --> 45:45.600
All right. Okay, you guys start talking and walking. So you tell me you saw one in Spears. We found it in a

45:46.200 --> 45:49.640
Fucked up head of a body which makes me

45:50.800 --> 45:54.340
Keith in his mind is like oh fuck, you know like

45:55.200 --> 45:58.140
yeah, we got it out and we handled it and

45:58.900 --> 46:00.740
Nothing happened to it. Oh

46:00.740 --> 46:08.060
You touched the ball. No, I didn't but who do you well one of my fellow officers?

46:09.220 --> 46:15.480
Went back before all this shit went down. I was a police officer. I probably yeah, I'm not anymore

46:15.480 --> 46:17.480
I don't I don't guess but

46:18.260 --> 46:23.540
yeah, he had it on him and he touched it we had another one too and

46:24.380 --> 46:26.380
we had a

46:26.380 --> 46:29.180
Well, this might be too much information, but fuck it

46:29.700 --> 46:36.420
Been a weird weird week. We have a bag that if you put these these silver balls in there, they disappear

46:36.420 --> 46:42.780
They do what now they disappear you put it in the bag and then there's nothing in it after that is

46:44.200 --> 46:49.040
Remarkable and it doesn't make sense. Where do you find these they're

46:50.000 --> 46:57.640
Let's go ahead and just and that elevator door that you're in opens up and you are looking at the hallway that leads to

46:58.040 --> 47:00.240
Marvin Glasses office and

47:01.120 --> 47:03.120
You walk down to the end of the hallway

47:03.760 --> 47:07.400
there's a 10 by 10 slab of black marble an

47:08.160 --> 47:13.560
enormous and strange door that slowly slides open as you approach and

47:14.200 --> 47:20.240
As it slides open Keith gets a weird shiver down his neck because he remembers the last time he was here you

47:20.680 --> 47:26.080
Remember looking down at this room earlier and she says wait a second

47:26.080 --> 47:29.800
There was water and as she's saying that water just starts

47:30.680 --> 47:37.880
Exploding out of this door and begins filling up the hallway that you were in needed a role in athletics check to swim

47:37.880 --> 47:39.880
Oh

47:44.480 --> 47:46.480
All right

47:58.560 --> 48:00.560
Joe Clark Bishop is

48:01.040 --> 48:05.700
standing in front of Marvin Glass unable to move and the first thing that he says is

48:08.200 --> 48:15.280
Visitors and then he holds up his hand and he pulls up out of the water below you

48:15.800 --> 48:17.800
Keith Vigna and

48:17.900 --> 48:24.280
The scientist the woman in the white lab coat and the goggles and the foppish hair

48:24.280 --> 48:29.540
That's the classic mad scientist the classic mad scientist and they both immediately

48:30.200 --> 48:37.320
Come out of the water. They're drenched and then all of a sudden they're both standing there next to you as well when you both

48:37.880 --> 48:42.560
Look around you see on this desk on this like platform

48:43.280 --> 48:45.280
Desk in front of you

48:45.320 --> 48:47.320
He has sitting

48:47.320 --> 48:49.320
the very strange camera

48:49.320 --> 48:51.320
the very strange gun and

48:52.520 --> 48:54.520
a silver sphere

48:54.960 --> 48:57.040
that is on a little platform and

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
in his hand

49:00.040 --> 49:07.320
It's a picture and you recognize it as one of the Polaroid pictures that would come out of this strange camera

49:07.360 --> 49:10.240
and he holds it up to the two of you and

49:10.880 --> 49:15.640
Looking at this picture you see in this darkness

49:15.840 --> 49:21.340
This world of darkness that you've seen before with the ground made of light coming up

49:22.520 --> 49:24.520
you see

49:25.640 --> 49:32.680
John Lee Pettymore in the body of Kevin Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop and he says

49:33.080 --> 49:34.480
Tell me

49:34.480 --> 49:36.960
What you know about this?

49:38.320 --> 49:40.320
I

49:43.520 --> 49:46.840
Keith literally does what I just did and his

49:47.680 --> 49:54.080
Mouth agape jaw dropped the same. I can't I don't like

50:07.320 --> 50:09.320
Oh

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Try

50:21.640 --> 50:23.640
Try

50:37.320 --> 50:39.320
You
