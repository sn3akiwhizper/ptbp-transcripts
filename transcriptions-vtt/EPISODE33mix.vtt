00:00.000 --> 00:08.480
What's up my babies, what's down, what's all around, what can never drown, it is me,

00:08.480 --> 00:17.500
a wolf the dog of course, and I'm here taking up all kinds of space on 694.2 PTBP, the greatest

00:17.500 --> 00:20.400
damn radio station that ever was.

00:20.400 --> 00:25.900
I've got an announcement here that comes straight from my producer, later today, following

00:25.900 --> 00:27.460
the release of this show.

00:27.460 --> 00:34.420
The second Patreon exclusive bonus episode drops for all of our honorary police officers.

00:34.420 --> 00:40.580
The whole cast, even some guy named Justin, got together and played an absurdly delightful

00:40.580 --> 00:43.020
game of Everyone is John.

00:43.020 --> 00:48.820
You can hear that, as well as our first bonus episode, another Q&A session, by following

00:48.820 --> 00:55.380
the link to our Patreon in the show notes, or going to patreon.com slash pretending pod,

00:55.380 --> 01:02.500
and becoming an honorary police officer by pledging $5 a month to keep the show alive.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.940
You know what keeps ol' Wolfie alive?

01:04.940 --> 01:11.580
It's that real shit, that good good, it's the fatherfuckin' news y'all.

01:11.580 --> 01:16.900
It has come to my attention that the boys from Contention are sitting pretty in the

01:16.900 --> 01:20.060
city, though not without tension.

01:20.060 --> 01:25.640
Rosemary convinced John Lee Pettymore IV that Marvin Glass would help them out in exchange

01:25.640 --> 01:31.040
for the strange gun-like invention they found in the possession of Tildy B. Mitchell immediately

01:31.040 --> 01:33.520
prior to her disappearance.

01:33.520 --> 01:39.660
Rosemary and Marvin Glass clearly had other intentions, leaving our idiot cop heroes in

01:39.660 --> 01:45.780
a sort of cage match to tension playfully referred to as the Juice Box.

01:45.780 --> 01:55.540
I'm not really confident on everything that happened next, but I will mention the deaths

01:55.540 --> 01:58.420
of all three cops from Contention.

01:58.420 --> 02:05.580
In a lucky ascension, the boys rose from necrotic dimensions, leaving my mind and belief in

02:05.580 --> 02:12.700
suspension, and now they are all in attendance at the funeral of Ari Manstein, the trusty

02:12.700 --> 02:15.860
co-worker whose name kept changing.

02:15.860 --> 02:21.820
The officers' incomprehension must have led to some apprehension as they never once looked

02:21.820 --> 02:24.900
into the reasoning behind the faulty memories.

02:24.900 --> 02:32.100
But of course, you already knew all that, and if you did not, no condescension, there

02:32.100 --> 02:37.060
is a lot going on, almost too much full retention.

02:37.060 --> 02:44.460
But my mind is inclined to find that which will remind you to bump and grind and unwind.

02:44.460 --> 03:03.860
It's Kudzu, baby, with no bat-o.

03:03.860 --> 03:14.700
Got wind blow, hammer of the gods, guide us ships to new lands, how we come to tides

03:14.700 --> 03:20.140
of war, Valhalla we are calling.

03:20.140 --> 03:21.140
I'm coming.

03:21.140 --> 03:23.140
Valhalla, I'm coming.

03:23.140 --> 03:29.380
Guys, it's been a really long time since we've all been in this room to record this podcast

03:29.380 --> 03:30.380
together.

03:30.380 --> 03:31.380
It has, actually.

03:31.380 --> 03:35.680
We've done individual sessions, but this is the first time we've all been in here, besides

03:35.680 --> 03:37.900
the Q&As, to play.

03:37.900 --> 03:39.420
I had forgotten about that.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.420
I'm excited.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.420
Me, too.

03:41.420 --> 03:43.860
Oh, hey, so here's a freebie Q&A.

03:43.860 --> 03:48.300
Somebody on the subreddit had asked why it took us six months between recording sessions,

03:48.300 --> 03:51.380
and he asked, did we think the podcast wouldn't work out?

03:51.380 --> 03:52.580
And that's not the case.

03:52.580 --> 03:56.900
It's just that we had recorded so much before we started that that's how long it took us

03:56.900 --> 04:01.100
to get to releasing an episode weekly and playing again.

04:01.100 --> 04:08.220
It also took me a solid year to convince myself that I was ready for the technical

04:08.220 --> 04:14.000
challenge of editing a audio show every week, as I've never done that before.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.440
You were well up to the task, but it was a risk to record six months' worth of a podcast

04:20.440 --> 04:22.460
before we got any listener feedback.

04:22.460 --> 04:23.460
That's true.

04:23.460 --> 04:24.460
Yeah.

04:24.460 --> 04:25.460
Yep, yep, yep.

04:25.460 --> 04:26.460
Ballsy.

04:26.460 --> 04:27.460
To the wallsy.

04:27.460 --> 04:30.900
Ballsy to the wallsy.

04:30.900 --> 04:31.900
We still got it.

04:31.900 --> 04:32.900
Yeah, baby.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.900
That's what we do.

04:34.900 --> 04:35.900
Oh, thank God.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.900
Luke, you're not still on one of the old mics, are you?

04:37.900 --> 04:38.900
I don't think so, no.

04:38.900 --> 04:39.900
No, he's on the new one.

04:39.900 --> 04:40.900
Do I sound normal now?

04:40.900 --> 04:41.900
Shout a little bit.

04:41.900 --> 04:42.900
Hey, you sound good.

04:42.900 --> 04:43.900
Cool, thank you.

04:43.900 --> 04:44.900
You sound hot.

04:44.900 --> 04:45.900
Oh, baby.

04:45.900 --> 04:46.900
ASL, Luke.

04:46.900 --> 04:47.900
Twenty-five, male, Springfield, Missouri.

04:47.900 --> 04:48.900
Not interested.

04:48.900 --> 04:49.900
Asked and answered.

04:49.900 --> 04:50.900
Twenty-five.

04:50.900 --> 04:51.900
All right, so.

04:51.900 --> 04:52.900
Baby.

04:52.900 --> 04:53.900
Baby.

04:53.900 --> 04:54.900
Oh, boy.

04:54.900 --> 04:55.900
Baby, Luke.

04:55.900 --> 04:56.900
Baby, Luke.

04:56.900 --> 04:57.900
Oh, no.

04:57.900 --> 05:14.180
Wait, okay, here, out of all of us, you're the baby Luke, who's the daddy Luke, who's

05:14.180 --> 05:15.820
the mommy Luke, who's the grandpa Luke?

05:15.820 --> 05:17.380
I think Joe is the daddy Luke.

05:17.380 --> 05:18.580
It's so obvious, yeah.

05:18.580 --> 05:21.080
Thomas is grandpa Luke and I'm mommy Luke.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.080
That sounds right.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.420
I can drive with that.

05:23.940 --> 05:24.940
I definitely thought you were daddy Luke, but-

05:24.940 --> 05:30.060
I love doing a podcast with my family.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.540
So welcome to this podcast.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.980
You're in the shit.

05:33.980 --> 05:34.980
You are in Zach's.

05:34.980 --> 05:35.980
Welcome, yeah.

05:35.980 --> 05:36.980
Part of his room.

05:36.980 --> 05:41.180
Welcome to the twisted world of Zach Reeves.

05:41.180 --> 05:43.180
Doxed.

05:43.180 --> 05:48.000
All right, so.

05:48.080 --> 05:55.960
The three of you are in a cemetery in the city, along with many other funeral attendees.

05:55.960 --> 06:00.480
Wait, no, I didn't go there.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.040
I can't wait for the crawfish.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.400
All the seats are basically full.

06:04.400 --> 06:07.480
There's still some people standing around in the back.

06:07.480 --> 06:12.160
You don't recognize anyone in attendance from contention.

06:12.160 --> 06:17.920
Other than Jan Manstein, Ari's mother, she's just popping in and out of everywhere, talking

06:17.920 --> 06:23.880
to everyone, shaking hands, kissing babies, doing the whole thing.

06:23.880 --> 06:28.880
And eventually everyone kind of settles down and she takes her place at the podium next

06:28.880 --> 06:33.880
to the coffin with the crawfish boil in front of it.

06:33.880 --> 06:40.960
And the smell wafts through the cemetery with the pungency that seafood carries.

06:40.960 --> 06:41.960
And she begins.

06:41.960 --> 06:45.720
Oh guys, thank you so much for coming.

06:45.720 --> 06:51.160
You know, I think that I'm really glad that everyone is able to make it out.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.160
Glad's maybe not the right word, but I'm happy.

06:53.160 --> 06:57.440
I'm not happy, but this is, it's just good to see everyone.

06:57.440 --> 07:02.280
And thank you for coming to Ari's funeral.

07:02.280 --> 07:07.800
She was taken too soon from us in the fire that claimed the lives of many here in the

07:07.800 --> 07:09.040
city.

07:09.040 --> 07:15.540
And we are here to celebrate her life, really mourn her loss, but also celebrate her life

07:15.540 --> 07:16.980
but also mourn her loss.

07:16.980 --> 07:22.100
And really just, we're here to talk about Ari.

07:22.100 --> 07:29.940
And one person who doesn't get to talk about Ari very often, really come into the public

07:29.940 --> 07:36.620
often, I haven't seen him very much recently, but my ex-husband, Stan Manstein, he's here

07:36.620 --> 07:38.520
and he's going to say a few words.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.940
So thank you.

07:40.940 --> 07:47.080
And I guess the service will begin, or maybe it already began, but it's happening now.

07:47.080 --> 07:53.720
And as she takes her seat, you see movement from the mausoleums, the tombs that are behind

07:53.720 --> 07:57.500
the coffin area, there's some movement there.

07:57.500 --> 08:06.120
And a man walks out and he is wearing all white, he is dressed in all white shirt and

08:06.120 --> 08:11.180
pants, and his hands are behind his back.

08:11.180 --> 08:16.800
Following him are three men wearing all black tactical combat gear.

08:16.800 --> 08:22.580
One has a scar running under his chin across his neck, another has a Glasgow smile, and

08:22.580 --> 08:26.200
the third has a scar straight down the middle of his face.

08:26.200 --> 08:30.900
And they all look eerily similar and they're all tall and overweight.

08:30.900 --> 08:32.040
What was the first one again?

08:32.040 --> 08:35.600
He's got a scar running under his chin across his neck.

08:35.600 --> 08:42.040
The three men stand behind Stan Manstein as he takes his place at the podium.

08:42.040 --> 08:46.740
And Stan has extremely long, unkempt hair.

08:46.740 --> 08:52.960
It's matted and tangled, and his beard is similarly pretty gross, actually.

08:52.960 --> 09:01.200
He's got a real Charlie Manson vibe going on, and he's got a weathered leather face.

09:01.200 --> 09:06.240
There's a small microphone on the podium, and he pokes it with his finger and you hear

09:06.240 --> 09:09.680
a woom, woom, woom, woom.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.680
What?

09:10.680 --> 09:11.680
Nope.

09:11.680 --> 09:15.120
Why were his hands behind his back did you say?

09:15.120 --> 09:16.520
I think that's just how he was walking.

09:16.520 --> 09:17.520
Gotcha, they weren't shackled.

09:17.520 --> 09:18.520
Nope.

09:18.520 --> 09:19.520
Gotcha.

09:19.520 --> 09:22.020
And Stan Manstein begins to speak.

09:22.020 --> 09:38.260
And as he begins to speak this full nonsense, you hear, through the noise, him speaking

09:38.260 --> 09:40.220
English to you.

09:40.220 --> 09:46.780
And time slows to the pace of molasses.

09:46.780 --> 09:49.980
And inside all your heads, you hear.

09:49.980 --> 09:56.340
My daughter was kind, hardworking, and good every time.

09:56.340 --> 09:59.300
She was those things when she was a police officer.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.120
She was those things when she was a school teacher.

10:02.120 --> 10:05.300
She was those things when she was a historian.

10:05.300 --> 10:11.700
You see, one long time ago, when this land was stolen and pioneer towns began to form,

10:11.700 --> 10:19.680
Silas Cole was a miner in the mine that employed the town nearby of contention.

10:19.680 --> 10:24.160
Now we're going to do this in a round-by-round basis.

10:24.160 --> 10:29.960
And that was Stan Manstein's first round.

10:29.960 --> 10:34.100
Oh my god.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.680
So are we in combat with Stan Manstein?

10:36.680 --> 10:42.380
So technically, we're going to play this out in the combat rounds, however, you're willing

10:42.380 --> 10:46.880
to do, you're more than, you know, welcome.

10:46.880 --> 10:47.880
We're free to do?

10:47.880 --> 10:49.640
You're welcome to do whatever you want.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.560
Are you willing to do whatever you want?

10:52.560 --> 10:54.160
I don't know.

10:54.160 --> 10:59.880
So I would like to know what the dexterity is for Jon and for Keith.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.560
65 for Jon.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.560
60.

11:02.560 --> 11:03.560
Okay.

11:03.560 --> 11:06.520
So we are going to begin with Clark Bishop.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.680
I want to survey the crowd.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.280
You said time was slowing for me.

11:10.280 --> 11:13.280
Does it look like the crowd is slowed around me?

11:13.280 --> 11:14.280
Yes.

11:14.280 --> 11:15.280
Good question.

11:15.280 --> 11:18.320
Are any of them reacting in any way other than being still?

11:18.320 --> 11:19.320
No.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.920
I want to make my way toward the front.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.480
Am I moving at normal speed?

11:23.480 --> 11:24.480
You are.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.480
Nice.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.800
How are them guards looking?

11:26.800 --> 11:27.800
Stoic.

11:27.800 --> 11:28.800
I'm making my way toward the front.

11:28.800 --> 11:29.960
Making my way up front.

11:29.960 --> 11:37.080
Now for the reasons that listeners know and that some in the room don't, Thomas is going

11:37.080 --> 11:41.240
to let me know on paper what he is up to.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.240
Yeah.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.880
So, Thomas, you're up.

11:43.880 --> 11:48.920
I don't have to write down what I do for this round because I just observe.

11:48.920 --> 11:52.160
I'm ready, but I'm just keeping an eye on everything.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.160
All right.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.160
Keith?

11:54.160 --> 12:01.160
I stay seated, but I reach into my pocket and have my hand on my gun.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.160
Okay.

12:02.160 --> 12:08.960
While down in the mines, Silas Cole came upon an odd black substance and he became obsessed

12:08.960 --> 12:10.680
with studying it.

12:10.680 --> 12:14.600
The substance was invisible to others, but not to Cole.

12:14.600 --> 12:20.080
Exploiting the substance's wrong qualities, he became an inventor and made so much money

12:20.080 --> 12:23.360
off of his inventions that he bought the mine.

12:23.360 --> 12:27.800
He built an office on the top floor of the tall, skinny mining company building that

12:27.800 --> 12:30.520
sat right above the mine itself.

12:30.520 --> 12:36.320
He began to harvest the residue and acquired a much firmer grasp on its tendencies.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.160
He invented wild, magical things.

12:39.160 --> 12:44.360
Each new invention brought him wealth and power, but also released more of this inky

12:44.360 --> 12:46.760
substance into the town.

12:46.760 --> 12:50.400
Joe, what does Clark do?

12:50.400 --> 12:52.680
I'm walking up the middle of the aisle.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.680
Yeah.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.840
And I want to get to the edge of the chairs.

12:55.840 --> 12:59.880
And in the diagram, I'm to the center left of the podium.

12:59.880 --> 13:00.880
Yeah.

13:00.880 --> 13:05.520
And I'm going to let him keep talking.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.520
Thomas?

13:06.520 --> 13:09.280
Okay, well, I will write this one down.

13:09.280 --> 13:15.920
Thomas has requested that I let the audience know here that John Lee Pettymore begins slowly

13:15.920 --> 13:22.280
making his way toward the front along the right side of the map, which can be seen on

13:22.280 --> 13:27.520
our Instagram and Twitter pages found at PretendingPod.

13:27.520 --> 13:32.880
I see Bishop coming up and I look over and make eye contact with him, but I don't say

13:32.880 --> 13:33.880
anything.

13:33.880 --> 13:34.880
Are you, are you sitting?

13:34.880 --> 13:38.120
I'm in the seat right in the middle aisle.

13:38.120 --> 13:39.360
So I'm like standing next to you?

13:39.360 --> 13:40.360
You're standing right next to me.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.800
I put my hand on his, on Keith's shoulder.

13:42.800 --> 13:48.120
I look up at him and kind of nod and then, Keith, what's up?

13:48.120 --> 13:51.480
Is it bubble gum?

13:51.480 --> 13:52.480
Bubble gum tree.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.480
Bubble gum tree.

13:53.480 --> 13:54.480
Bubble gum tree.

13:54.480 --> 14:00.360
I feel a little more at ease knowing that you just asked me that.

14:00.360 --> 14:06.280
So in the, in the fiction of the rounds that we're doing here, uh, he, Manstein would still

14:06.280 --> 14:13.160
be talking while we're talking, but we, we're, we're synced in time.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.160
Yeah.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.160
Okay.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.160
That's super cool.

14:16.160 --> 14:23.240
I kind of squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze your shoulder, Keith, I'm glad you're

14:23.240 --> 14:24.240
with us.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.240
I am too.

14:25.720 --> 14:31.600
We can talk about this later, but I've been, it's been an interesting day.

14:31.600 --> 14:35.680
If anything happens, you know, I still got your back and I would hope you'd have mine.

14:35.680 --> 14:36.680
I do.

14:36.680 --> 14:44.580
And I, I scratched my head and you can see a scar going down from my finger, down my

14:44.580 --> 14:46.680
arm to my elbow.

14:46.680 --> 14:49.120
I'm not like showing it to you, but you, you see it.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.120
I notice it.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.120
Yeah.

14:51.120 --> 14:55.040
Do you think we should let him keep telling this story?

14:55.680 --> 14:57.280
I'm interested in what he's saying.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.040
He just mentioned the black goo.

14:59.040 --> 15:03.280
I am too, but I don't know if the public needs to know what he's about to say.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.520
I gesture around us.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.760
I don't know if they, I don't know if they know.

15:06.760 --> 15:12.220
I just look back up at Manstein and to divert his raising paranoia, he began looking for

15:12.220 --> 15:13.220
a partner.

15:13.220 --> 15:18.400
He found a similarly intelligent engineer and his wife, Mary Cole, who could also see

15:18.400 --> 15:24.320
the substance they began calling residue, but Silas Cole was scared of their inventions.

15:24.320 --> 15:29.360
He became paranoid that other people could see the residue that was loose all over the

15:29.360 --> 15:30.360
town.

15:30.360 --> 15:34.680
Consumed, he believed the town was plotting against him, so he began kidnapping people

15:34.680 --> 15:37.080
he suspected knew too much.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.600
Clark, you're up.

15:46.200 --> 15:50.000
Good, good fucking work, Zach, on making this so fucking hard.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
This is tight.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.480
Clark, Clark does nothing.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.480
Clark is going to keep listening.

15:57.480 --> 15:58.480
Okay.

15:58.480 --> 16:04.100
John Lee Pettymore continues moving forward along the right side that you can see along

16:04.100 --> 16:08.040
the map on our Instagram page and our Twitter page.

16:08.040 --> 16:13.200
It was made by Justin based off of a terrible drawing that I made.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.640
Keith, what do you do?

16:14.640 --> 16:17.040
I look over at Bishop again.

16:17.080 --> 16:23.440
We're both soaking in the information that we're learning from Manstein, and when you

16:23.440 --> 16:31.000
look over at me, looking a little closer, you see another giant scar on my forehead

16:31.000 --> 16:32.640
going down on my face.

16:32.640 --> 16:35.560
Are they fresh looking or are they healed looking?

16:35.560 --> 16:36.560
Probably pretty fresh.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.560
Probably pretty fresh, yeah.

16:37.560 --> 16:38.560
Okay.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.280
Would Joe recognize these scars from anybody he's seen before?

16:40.280 --> 16:41.400
Are they similar?

16:41.400 --> 16:46.320
Joe, go ahead and have Clark roll an intelligence for me, or I guess Joe is the one who rolls

16:46.320 --> 16:48.000
intelligence for me.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Joe rolls four-clack.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.640
I'll do it on behalf of Clark.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.640
That's a fail.

16:53.640 --> 16:54.640
Sixty-seven on a fifty-five.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.640
Okay.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.480
It doesn't remind you of anything.

16:57.480 --> 17:03.140
You're just mostly shocked that not only is he alive, but these scars also might explain

17:03.140 --> 17:06.680
his aliveness.

17:06.680 --> 17:09.640
And Keith, you are staring at Clark.

17:09.640 --> 17:10.640
He is staring at you.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.700
You're very near each other, right next to each other in fact.

17:12.700 --> 17:19.100
I'm just kind of shaking my head like almost mouth agape, just like, the fuck?

17:19.100 --> 17:20.740
And that's what I do.

17:20.740 --> 17:21.740
Okay.

17:21.740 --> 17:27.220
At this point in time, you notice that the three men who are dressed in all black begin

17:27.220 --> 17:37.300
slowly converging on Stan Manstein, but they are moving at the pace of a high viscosity

17:37.300 --> 17:38.300
liquid.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.300
Got it.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.300
They're moving slow.

17:40.300 --> 17:46.300
They're moving slowly, but they are clearly moving toward Stan.

17:46.300 --> 17:52.380
The town was suspicious of the disappearances, but most of the ones gone were bad people.

17:52.380 --> 17:57.260
The whole saloon staff, the bartender, Miss Kitty, the piano player, there was a few gamblers,

17:57.260 --> 18:01.700
the town drunk, so they kept their heads down and went about their business.

18:01.700 --> 18:06.900
But then some good people disappeared, a professor, a circuit judge, a rancher, a homesteader,

18:06.900 --> 18:10.540
the homesteader's wife, then the preacher disappeared.

18:10.540 --> 18:15.740
The town freaked out and they hired a roaming cowboy named Cornelius Beams to kill their

18:15.740 --> 18:18.980
weird paranoid figurehead.

18:18.980 --> 18:19.980
Awesome.

18:19.980 --> 18:23.740
Clark, it's your turn.

18:23.740 --> 18:27.420
I'm drawing my weapon and shooting at Stan.

18:27.420 --> 18:29.360
Roll firearms.

18:29.360 --> 18:35.060
That's a pass, a 43 on an 80.

18:35.060 --> 18:36.060
All right.

18:36.220 --> 18:38.860
Go ahead and roll 1d10 for damage.

18:38.860 --> 18:40.460
A 5.

18:40.460 --> 18:43.380
You pull out your gun in the middle of a funeral.

18:43.380 --> 18:47.060
I mean, it's not a normal funeral, sure.

18:47.060 --> 18:54.740
The smell of crawfish fills the air and time is slow and this man is speaking to you in

18:54.740 --> 18:59.060
your head in this odd spell-like cadence.

18:59.060 --> 19:06.500
You pull out your firearm and you shoot at Stan Manstein and you hit him directly in

19:06.500 --> 19:09.900
the chest.

19:09.900 --> 19:13.540
Time immediately picks back up.

19:13.540 --> 19:14.620
Thomas.

19:14.620 --> 19:21.820
You all would see Kevin from behind the stage firing from behind the stage into the back

19:21.820 --> 19:24.420
of one of those guys converging on Stan right now.

19:24.420 --> 19:27.940
Go ahead and roll firearms.

19:27.980 --> 19:29.700
89.

19:29.700 --> 19:30.700
That's a miss.

19:30.700 --> 19:31.700
You want to describe it?

19:31.700 --> 19:32.700
Yeah.

19:32.700 --> 19:42.940
I totally missed the first guy, but I accidentally hit the next guy in the head and he drops

19:42.940 --> 19:44.340
the ground deck.

19:44.340 --> 19:46.780
Damn it, I say.

19:46.780 --> 19:47.780
You let him, Zach.

19:47.780 --> 19:51.540
It's canon.

19:51.540 --> 20:00.820
Let's say the one with the scar on his neck.

20:00.820 --> 20:07.180
I want to see how this plays out.

20:07.180 --> 20:13.300
I can see in Zach's head, he's like, do I let him do this?

20:13.300 --> 20:16.180
I like it so much, but it's not what happened.

20:16.180 --> 20:20.340
It's not what the dice say, and 89 is pretty bad.

20:20.340 --> 20:26.900
Keith Vigna, Clark Bishop, you both see Kevin, the security guard who you saw for the first

20:26.900 --> 20:32.580
time at the bar in the Marvin Glass cage fighting den emporium.

20:32.580 --> 20:33.980
We got real close.

20:33.980 --> 20:34.980
Uh-huh.

20:34.980 --> 20:37.780
Yeah, I believe he killed you.

20:37.780 --> 20:38.880
I think so.

20:38.880 --> 20:42.100
He fires and misses into this crowd.

20:42.100 --> 20:44.060
Keith, it is your turn.

20:44.060 --> 20:51.060
Oh, and also at this point in time, the audience freaks out and people all stand up and begin

20:51.060 --> 20:52.940
screaming and panicking.

20:52.940 --> 20:53.940
Yeah.

20:53.940 --> 20:58.620
Once, I mean this boom, boom, I pull my gun out and aim for one of the security officers

20:58.620 --> 20:59.620
as well.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.460
Are you just aiming this round or are you going to fire?

21:01.460 --> 21:02.460
I'm firing.

21:02.460 --> 21:03.460
All right.

21:03.460 --> 21:06.840
Go ahead and roll that firearms check.

21:06.840 --> 21:07.840
That's a three.

21:07.840 --> 21:08.840
Nice.

21:08.840 --> 21:12.580
Ooh, roll a, are you firing, you're firing with your small.

21:12.580 --> 21:13.580
Powerful gun.

21:14.100 --> 21:18.300
Rolled 2D10 for damage on that small powerful gun.

21:18.300 --> 21:19.300
15.

21:19.300 --> 21:20.300
15.

21:20.300 --> 21:21.300
Oh, shoot.

21:21.300 --> 21:22.300
Wait, what?

21:22.300 --> 21:23.300
2D10.

21:23.300 --> 21:24.300
A six and a nine.

21:24.300 --> 21:25.300
A six and a nine.

21:25.300 --> 21:26.300
Oh, congratulations.

21:26.300 --> 21:27.300
Oh.

21:27.300 --> 21:35.320
So you fire into one of the guards wearing the all black and you fire into him and he

21:35.320 --> 21:36.380
goes down.

21:36.380 --> 21:39.700
You don't know that he's dead, but he definitely goes down.

21:39.700 --> 21:40.700
On the ground.

21:40.700 --> 21:41.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:41.700 --> 21:42.700
You knock him right on his back.

21:42.820 --> 21:49.340
Keith, the guard that you shot hits the ground and immediately you all hear three gunshots

21:49.340 --> 21:51.520
echo out from around you.

21:51.520 --> 21:56.380
You don't know quite where they came from, but you see the body that is on the ground

21:56.380 --> 22:03.340
flops three times and then lays completely flat and it looks like someone finished off

22:03.340 --> 22:07.580
this guy in all black completely dead, just offed him.

22:07.580 --> 22:12.380
It is the turn of the other two in all black.

22:12.380 --> 22:19.980
The first one turns around and tries to grapple Kevin who is behind him and I'm going to need

22:19.980 --> 22:23.180
you to roll unarmed combat for me, Thomas.

22:23.180 --> 22:24.180
Okay.

22:24.180 --> 22:25.180
Haha.

22:25.180 --> 22:27.180
25 out of 40.

22:27.180 --> 22:28.180
Okay.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.500
You get the better end of him.

22:29.500 --> 22:33.820
So as he comes running toward you, what do you do with his weight?

22:33.820 --> 22:38.700
He is like six and a half, seven feet tall and quite wide and you can do with him what

22:38.700 --> 22:39.700
you want.

22:39.700 --> 22:40.700
Okay.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.700
So he goes out to dinner and...

22:42.700 --> 22:43.700
Haha.

22:43.700 --> 22:44.700
Lucky?

22:44.700 --> 22:47.420
You got a lot of man headed your way.

22:47.420 --> 22:55.260
No, I get down low and lean into him with my shoulder, like my left shoulder and just

22:55.260 --> 22:57.220
kind of flip him over my back.

22:57.220 --> 22:59.100
And is it my turn or is that just a reaction?

22:59.100 --> 23:00.460
No, it's just a reaction.

23:00.460 --> 23:06.820
The other one actually is running toward you as well and rolled a 100.

23:06.820 --> 23:07.820
Okay.

23:07.820 --> 23:08.820
Nice.

23:09.220 --> 23:10.940
He trips over his own dick.

23:10.940 --> 23:11.940
Haha.

23:11.940 --> 23:12.940
Ow.

23:12.940 --> 23:13.940
So what actually...

23:13.940 --> 23:14.940
Haha.

23:14.940 --> 23:17.900
That's payback for the cage.

23:17.900 --> 23:18.900
What does he do?

23:18.900 --> 23:19.900
He rolls a 100.

23:19.900 --> 23:25.100
Yeah, he rolls a 100 and as he runs out, he holds one of his arms out toward you like

23:25.100 --> 23:33.100
you saw the giant robot man in the house of James the mill worker.

23:33.140 --> 23:38.940
As it begins to fly off, it actually flies cattywampus and goes behind him, wrapping

23:38.940 --> 23:45.620
around his legs and he falls and hits the ground and he is currently like hogtied basically

23:45.620 --> 23:47.620
by his own trip wires.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.860
I say eat shit, Inspector Gadget.

23:49.860 --> 23:52.740
Let's go put him on the train tracks.

23:52.740 --> 24:00.420
Stan Manstein is recovering from the shot to his chest and he begins to try to muster

24:00.420 --> 24:04.980
the strength to go on, but for at least this round, he is unable.

24:04.980 --> 24:06.660
Clark, it is your turn.

24:06.660 --> 24:09.700
So one guy is hogtied on the ground, what's the other guy doing?

24:09.700 --> 24:13.900
We got one dead on the ground, one hogtied on the ground and one that John has just flipped

24:13.900 --> 24:14.980
over his shoulder.

24:14.980 --> 24:16.740
I'm taking another shot at Stan.

24:16.740 --> 24:20.460
Go ahead and roll firearms for me.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.460
We might need Stan.

24:22.460 --> 24:23.860
64 on an 80.

24:23.860 --> 24:24.860
I pass.

24:24.860 --> 24:25.860
All right.

24:25.860 --> 24:26.860
Roll 1d10.

24:26.860 --> 24:27.860
10.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.300
I fucking knew you were going to 10.

24:31.300 --> 24:32.300
I saw 0.

24:32.300 --> 24:33.300
I'm like hell yeah.

24:33.300 --> 24:36.300
I was like oh.

24:36.300 --> 24:40.420
That's going to be enough to drop him fully, fully to the ground.

24:40.420 --> 24:46.680
So when you fire into him, he steps backward with the weight of the bullets ripping through

24:46.680 --> 24:51.900
his skin and as he falls backward, you see blood begin to pour out of the holes that

24:51.900 --> 24:55.420
you have put in him and he is lying on the ground.

24:55.420 --> 24:56.680
It is John's turn.

24:56.680 --> 24:59.440
I'm just going to shoot the guy who's on the ground.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.440
Yeah.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.440
He's right there.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.360
You get a plus 20 on your shot right now.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.880
On the hogtied?

25:05.880 --> 25:06.880
Not the hogtied one.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.300
The one who I flipped over my shoulder.

25:08.300 --> 25:13.160
So straight up, just two in the chest, one in the head, like I just try to end him.

25:13.160 --> 25:16.160
Roll it for me, daddy.

25:16.160 --> 25:20.480
Oh, 78 on a 60.

25:20.480 --> 25:25.820
As you move your gun into position to fire on him, he freaks out and flexes and he moves

25:25.820 --> 25:29.700
your arm out of the way and you fire into the ground right next to his head.

25:29.700 --> 25:31.460
Are you 60 natural?

25:31.460 --> 25:34.060
Because he gave you a plus 20, which would make you pass.

25:34.060 --> 25:35.060
Oh, yeah.

25:35.060 --> 25:36.060
I pass.

25:36.060 --> 25:37.980
Oh, good looking out.

25:37.980 --> 25:40.020
Hell yeah, Joe.

25:40.020 --> 25:41.020
He's the best at it.

25:41.020 --> 25:45.380
I forgot about the 20 you gave me as soon as I started talking.

25:45.380 --> 25:50.820
So as you are firing into the ground, you get enough strength back in your arm.

25:50.820 --> 25:56.940
The momentum of the gun firing carries my aim right into his heart.

25:56.940 --> 26:02.060
Immediately into his head and heart multiple times.

26:02.060 --> 26:06.820
And batting number two, this man, this large, large man who you just took to the ground

26:06.820 --> 26:08.620
is also dead.

26:08.620 --> 26:10.220
It is now Keith's turn.

26:10.220 --> 26:14.580
I run over to Manstein and I want to apply first aid.

26:14.580 --> 26:15.580
Okay.

26:15.580 --> 26:17.860
Go ahead and roll first aid for me.

26:18.860 --> 26:21.260
Got a 53 and a 60.

26:21.260 --> 26:22.260
All right.

26:22.260 --> 26:24.060
Roll a D4 for me.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.700
Just for me.

26:25.700 --> 26:26.700
That is a four.

26:26.700 --> 26:27.700
Nice.

26:27.700 --> 26:28.700
All right.

26:28.700 --> 26:29.700
Describe what you do.

26:29.700 --> 26:33.180
I go stick my fingers in his bullet holes.

26:33.180 --> 26:34.180
Not really.

26:34.180 --> 26:35.180
No.

26:35.180 --> 26:36.180
Plug them up.

26:36.180 --> 26:37.980
Yeah, sure.

26:37.980 --> 26:38.980
He rolled a four.

26:38.980 --> 26:39.980
It works.

26:39.980 --> 26:43.440
In the city, that's what first aid is.

26:43.440 --> 26:51.920
As you dig your fingers into his bullet holes, you see his eyes just light up and almost

26:51.920 --> 26:55.520
as if he has taken adrenaline into his bloodstream.

26:55.520 --> 26:59.920
The pain from me doing that is definitely waking him up.

26:59.920 --> 27:03.880
It's enough to open those eyes right on up.

27:03.880 --> 27:10.560
And with that being done, he looks up at you and he is about to speak when you hear three

27:10.560 --> 27:13.000
more gunshots fire.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.440
I know.

27:15.440 --> 27:16.680
Woo.

27:16.680 --> 27:19.960
And actually- I don't like when you say woo.

27:19.960 --> 27:20.960
Yeah.

27:20.960 --> 27:32.320
All right, so Thomas, John feels a just fire in his back as a couple of bullets graze through

27:32.320 --> 27:40.400
and hit right above his ribs going through his back, and you lose five hit points.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.400
Uh-oh.

27:41.400 --> 27:42.400
Spaghetti-o's.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.400
Okay.

27:43.400 --> 27:54.680
There is one remaining man in black and he is very upset with the situation at hand.

27:54.680 --> 27:55.800
Which scar does he have?

27:55.800 --> 27:59.160
Oh, he's got this scar that's going straight down his face.

27:59.160 --> 28:00.160
This is the one that is all the way-

28:00.160 --> 28:01.160
It's not the Glasgow.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.160
Which one was the Glasgow smile again?

28:02.200 --> 28:04.200
Glasgow smile is the one that you just killed.

28:04.200 --> 28:05.200
Hell yeah.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.200
For sure.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.200
Yeah, fuck that guy.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.200
Is it a Glasgow?

28:08.200 --> 28:09.200
It's a Glasgow smile.

28:09.200 --> 28:10.200
The Willhelm scream.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.680
Glasgow smile, it's the scars coming out from the mouth.

28:12.680 --> 28:13.760
Isn't it something else though?

28:13.760 --> 28:17.680
I think actually Glasgow smile is not a politically correct way of saying it.

28:17.680 --> 28:21.160
What I mean is isn't the scars coming out from the mouth a different town smile?

28:21.160 --> 28:22.160
Oh.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.160
I'm going to Google it.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.160
It's not.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.160
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.

28:25.160 --> 28:27.160
You want to know how I got these scars?

28:27.160 --> 28:30.160
Was it Glasgow?

28:31.160 --> 28:33.160
Yeah, okay.

28:33.160 --> 28:36.160
Let's just take that part off the podcast, please.

28:36.160 --> 28:40.160
Thomas being wrong on the podcast.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.160
Leave it in, baby.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.160
Wait, wait.

28:43.160 --> 28:47.160
We're not friends if you leave it in.

28:47.160 --> 28:52.160
The guy who would wrap the tripwire around his own legs who fell on the ground, he actually

28:52.160 --> 28:59.160
pulls out a firearm from his spot laying on the ground and he fires it Clark Bishop.

29:00.160 --> 29:02.160
Doing eight damage.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.160
Holy shit.

29:03.160 --> 29:10.760
So he hits you in the chest and one of the arms and maybe the leg as well and you begin

29:10.760 --> 29:14.660
bleeding quite profusely and quickly.

29:14.660 --> 29:16.160
What hit points are you at now?

29:16.160 --> 29:17.160
18.

29:17.160 --> 29:18.160
All right.

29:18.160 --> 29:28.920
And then Stan looks up into the eyes of Keith Vigna and you guys all begin to hear time

29:29.180 --> 29:33.180
slow down and you hear the screams of the people.

29:33.180 --> 29:35.180
The pace of molasses.

29:35.180 --> 29:42.180
The screams of the people who are in the funeral not 30 seconds ago as they're making their

29:42.180 --> 29:45.180
way back to the parking lot at an absurd rate.

29:45.180 --> 29:47.180
But not anymore.

29:47.180 --> 29:48.180
All right.

29:48.180 --> 29:49.180
No longer absurd.

29:49.180 --> 29:52.180
Oh, also very absurd just in the opposite way.

29:52.180 --> 29:54.180
Yeah, absurdly slow now they're running.

29:54.180 --> 29:55.180
It's so dangerous.

29:55.180 --> 29:57.180
Why are you running so slow?

29:57.440 --> 30:00.180
You hear his voice in your head say,

30:00.180 --> 30:04.180
Silas and Mary Cole were never seen again.

30:04.180 --> 30:06.180
Neither was Cornelius Beans.

30:06.180 --> 30:14.180
That was the history of contention when my daughter's name was Mia or Leah or Micah or

30:14.180 --> 30:20.180
Ben but her name is Ari forever now and our history is different.

30:20.180 --> 30:22.180
Mine is now definite.

30:22.180 --> 30:30.180
And with that the body of Stan Manstein seems to in one swift instant turn inside out and

30:30.180 --> 30:32.180
blip out of existence.

30:32.180 --> 30:33.180
Oh, man.

30:33.180 --> 30:35.180
What happens to my fingers?

30:35.180 --> 30:36.180
That time, Dick.

30:36.180 --> 30:40.180
I need all three of you to roll sanity.

30:40.180 --> 30:42.180
Seven.

30:42.180 --> 30:43.180
Sane as fuck.

30:43.180 --> 30:44.180
Oh, shit.

30:44.180 --> 30:45.180
I'm going insane.

30:45.180 --> 30:46.180
I failed.

30:46.180 --> 30:47.180
I failed too.

30:47.180 --> 30:49.180
A 62 on a 21.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.180
And what's your power?

30:50.180 --> 30:51.180
60.

30:51.180 --> 30:53.180
Do we all have a mechanic left?

30:53.180 --> 30:54.180
I'm at 15 sanity.

30:54.180 --> 30:55.180
I rolled a 23.

30:55.180 --> 30:57.180
My power is 50.

30:57.180 --> 30:58.180
All right.

30:58.180 --> 31:00.180
Clark and Keith both lose one sanity.

31:00.180 --> 31:01.180
I'm at 20.

31:01.180 --> 31:02.180
I am now at 14.

31:02.180 --> 31:06.180
I pop up blind to the pain of the bullets that have ripped through my body and I am

31:06.180 --> 31:12.180
charging at the guy who had his legs hogtied on the ground.

31:12.180 --> 31:16.180
I'm rushing him and doing whatever I can to kill him.

31:16.180 --> 31:17.180
All right.

31:17.180 --> 31:18.180
Do you want to?

31:18.180 --> 31:21.180
I would like to fire my weapon into his face as I near.

31:21.180 --> 31:26.180
Go ahead and roll firearms there.

31:26.180 --> 31:28.180
I pass a 20 on an 80.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.180
All right.

31:29.180 --> 31:31.180
And roll a D10 for me.

31:31.180 --> 31:32.180
A seven.

31:32.180 --> 31:38.180
With him being already on the ground fully hogtied and you sprinting toward him, I think

31:38.180 --> 31:44.180
it's perfectly acceptable for you to end this man's life on this turn if you want to describe

31:44.180 --> 31:45.180
that.

31:45.180 --> 31:46.180
It's legal, baby.

31:47.180 --> 31:53.180
You guys would see rage over my face as I bum rush this guy and I'm firing as I'm

31:53.180 --> 31:54.180
running.

31:54.180 --> 31:59.180
And even as I come to a stop over his body, I just keep firing into his head, maybe screaming.

32:04.180 --> 32:13.180
And as you're firing into this head, you hear this like, and like all of these wires

32:13.180 --> 32:16.180
are flying and all these sparks are flying around.

32:16.180 --> 32:23.180
And this man's, I mean, not a man, it's like an android head just kind of like peels

32:23.180 --> 32:27.180
open to all the bullets that are flying through it.

32:27.180 --> 32:32.180
Something has exploded in it from the inside almost the way it peels out in every single

32:32.180 --> 32:37.180
direction of skin and viscera and metal and wires.

32:37.180 --> 32:41.180
And you look down satisfied.

32:41.180 --> 32:44.180
We're going to exit round combat.

32:44.180 --> 32:47.180
What if I want to fire on the civilians running away?

32:47.180 --> 32:50.180
I had a final move, sort of.

32:50.180 --> 32:51.180
It's pretty minor.

32:51.180 --> 32:56.180
Can I clarify, maybe I just missed this, the bullets that went through the back of John

32:56.180 --> 32:59.180
Lee Pettymore, were they from the guy on the ground?

32:59.180 --> 33:02.180
I thought we had an unknown assailant still shooting at us.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.180
They did not come from the guy on the ground.

33:04.180 --> 33:05.180
But we're not in combat.

33:05.180 --> 33:06.180
That is correct.

33:06.180 --> 33:07.180
Okay, cool.

33:07.180 --> 33:08.180
I'm glad I clarified.

33:08.180 --> 33:09.180
I dig it.

33:09.180 --> 33:10.180
I think my question is related to that.

33:11.180 --> 33:16.180
John Lee Pettymore looks up to the top of the mausoleum where Rosemary was perched

33:16.180 --> 33:20.180
earlier, and he sees absolutely nothing.

33:20.180 --> 33:22.180
Okay, so, yeah.

33:22.180 --> 33:24.180
So we're no longer in combat.

33:24.180 --> 33:26.180
What do we see when we look around?

33:26.180 --> 33:30.180
First off, the sun is a little bit higher in the sky now.

33:30.180 --> 33:33.180
The fog has slightly dissipated in this cemetery.

33:33.180 --> 33:37.180
The smell of crawfish is still potent as ever.

33:37.180 --> 33:41.180
The people who are attending this funeral are gone.

33:41.180 --> 33:50.180
The only bodies standing around are Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, Kevin, and the corpses

33:50.180 --> 33:55.180
of these large men who are half robot, half human.

33:55.180 --> 34:00.180
I want to go over to the casket and see if Ari is actually in there.

34:00.180 --> 34:02.180
Ari is actually in there.

34:02.180 --> 34:03.180
Okay.

34:03.180 --> 34:09.180
Clark regains some composure and whips around on Kevin and holds him at gunpoint.

34:09.180 --> 34:11.180
Hey, who are you?

34:11.180 --> 34:15.180
As you do this, I walk up next to Kevin and stand there.

34:15.180 --> 34:16.180
Like on his side?

34:16.180 --> 34:17.180
Yeah.

34:17.180 --> 34:19.180
Oh, I don't lower the gun.

34:19.180 --> 34:21.180
Keith, what are you doing?

34:21.180 --> 34:23.180
I have my hands down at my side.

34:23.180 --> 34:24.180
I'm just listening.

34:24.180 --> 34:25.180
I look at you.

34:25.180 --> 34:26.180
Kevin looks at you.

34:26.180 --> 34:28.180
He says, bubblegum tree.

34:28.180 --> 34:29.180
How do you know that word?

34:29.180 --> 34:30.180
How do you know that word?

34:30.180 --> 34:33.180
Why are you wearing an old contention PD uniform?

34:33.180 --> 34:34.180
Who are you?

34:34.180 --> 34:35.180
I'm Clark Bishop.

34:35.180 --> 34:37.180
Why are you alive?

34:37.180 --> 34:40.180
I don't, Keith, I don't know.

34:40.180 --> 34:41.180
Keith, why are you alive?

34:41.180 --> 34:43.180
I kind of know why Keith's alive.

34:43.180 --> 34:45.180
Actually, I do know why you're alive.

34:45.180 --> 34:46.180
I'm a little bit.

34:46.180 --> 34:51.180
Maybe you could tell me then because I don't know.

34:51.180 --> 34:55.180
Well, it's a little complicated.

34:55.180 --> 34:57.180
Real quick, bubblegum tree?

34:57.180 --> 34:58.180
Bubblegum tree.

34:58.180 --> 34:59.180
Bubblegum tree.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.180
What's Keith doing with his weapons?

35:01.180 --> 35:03.180
My gun's back in my pocket.

35:03.180 --> 35:05.180
Everybody bubblegum tree and let's put our guns down.

35:05.180 --> 35:07.180
Is that all right?

35:07.180 --> 35:10.180
I stare them down a little longer than you probably want,

35:10.180 --> 35:12.180
but I do start to.

35:12.180 --> 35:13.180
You can see I'm moving my guns down.

35:13.180 --> 35:15.180
I start to put them down.

35:15.180 --> 35:16.180
Okay, I holster my gun.

35:16.180 --> 35:18.180
I holster mine.

35:18.180 --> 35:24.180
I put mine in my pocket that is way too big for me.

35:24.180 --> 35:27.180
Yeah, we could tell you were authentic, Keith.

35:27.180 --> 35:32.180
Also, you guys would have noticed that I am no longer

35:32.180 --> 35:35.180
wearing my contention PD uniform.

35:35.180 --> 35:39.180
I'm wearing a way too small orange polo and three times

35:39.180 --> 35:45.180
too big teal frat boy pants and Sperry's.

35:45.180 --> 35:46.180
Nice.

35:46.180 --> 35:47.180
I was apprised of that.

35:47.180 --> 35:49.180
What are Sperry's?

35:49.180 --> 35:50.180
Like butt shoes?

35:50.180 --> 35:51.180
Gotcha.

35:51.180 --> 35:53.180
I actually, yeah, I knew that as well.

35:53.180 --> 35:54.180
Yeah, so I.

35:54.180 --> 35:56.180
It was very in character as far as I was concerned.

35:56.180 --> 36:02.180
My very tiny, powerful gun slips right into these huge.

36:02.180 --> 36:05.180
Right into your Sperry's.

36:05.180 --> 36:07.180
Right into my big, big old pocket.

36:07.180 --> 36:08.180
All right.

36:08.180 --> 36:10.180
Now that we've all bubble gum treed,

36:10.180 --> 36:14.180
let's talk about what's happened to us in the preceding 12 hours.

36:14.180 --> 36:17.180
Clark is still really side-eyeing you.

36:17.180 --> 36:18.180
He's right in front of you.

36:18.180 --> 36:19.180
Yeah, he's.

36:19.180 --> 36:20.180
And I turn.

36:20.180 --> 36:21.180
He's turned his head.

36:21.180 --> 36:23.180
So he's side-eyeing you.

36:23.180 --> 36:25.180
I can't even look at you.

36:26.180 --> 36:29.180
But yeah, I am side-eyeing you as I talk to Keith.

36:29.180 --> 36:32.180
Keith, do you know this guy?

36:32.180 --> 36:33.180
Well.

36:33.180 --> 36:34.180
Do you remember who he is?

36:34.180 --> 36:35.180
We saw him.

36:35.180 --> 36:36.180
He killed me.

36:36.180 --> 36:38.180
Clark goes back for his gun.

36:38.180 --> 36:44.180
But I owe his organization my life.

36:44.180 --> 36:46.180
His organization?

36:46.180 --> 36:47.180
The Glass family.

36:47.180 --> 36:52.180
Clark, can I talk to you without Keith?

36:52.180 --> 36:55.180
Actually, I go over to the crawfish pot.

36:55.180 --> 36:59.180
I just pull Clark aside if he'll let Kevin do that.

36:59.180 --> 37:00.180
I gesture like, hey man.

37:00.180 --> 37:04.180
Yeah, if you gestured, I would cautiously go.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.180
Hey, Clark.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.180
Hey man, bubble gum tree, bubble gum tree.

37:08.180 --> 37:11.180
Can't wait to talk for a minute.

37:11.180 --> 37:12.180
Yeah.

37:12.180 --> 37:14.180
How do you know that word?

37:14.180 --> 37:20.180
Well, because I was John Lee Pettymore.

37:20.180 --> 37:21.180
Listen.

37:21.180 --> 37:24.180
What does that mean?

37:24.180 --> 37:25.180
Right?

37:25.180 --> 37:26.180
Yeah.

37:26.180 --> 37:35.180
So I found out that John Lee Pettymore is more of a state of mind than just a single

37:35.180 --> 37:36.180
individual.

37:36.180 --> 37:37.180
Clark.

37:37.180 --> 37:38.180
Wow, man.

37:38.180 --> 37:40.180
This is going to be hard to explain.

37:40.180 --> 37:49.180
Basically, my daddy, whom I thought was slain by the DEA on his weed farm, turns out he

37:49.180 --> 37:56.180
was just lobotomized and he's been Marvin Glass's head of security for a while now.

37:56.180 --> 38:00.180
And when I died, turns out I wasn't John Lee Pettymore.

38:00.180 --> 38:04.180
I was some kind of alien squid being or something.

38:04.180 --> 38:09.180
But I sucked out of my brain and I left my body and I went into his.

38:09.180 --> 38:11.180
Clark is slack-jawed.

38:11.180 --> 38:12.180
Squid?

38:12.180 --> 38:13.180
Squid something?

38:13.180 --> 38:14.180
What was that?

38:14.180 --> 38:15.180
Or mechanical.

38:15.180 --> 38:16.180
I don't really know.

38:16.180 --> 38:24.180
All I know is I felt myself leave John's body and insert myself into my daddy's body.

38:24.180 --> 38:26.180
And now I'm him.

38:26.180 --> 38:30.180
You believe me, right?

38:30.180 --> 38:31.180
Clark doesn't.

38:31.180 --> 38:35.180
Ask me something only John Lee Pettymore would know.

38:35.180 --> 38:39.180
So Joe was just going through his notebook to try to find a good thing like that.

38:39.180 --> 38:40.180
Oh, I know.

38:40.180 --> 38:41.180
Okay.

38:41.180 --> 38:42.180
Me and John.

38:42.180 --> 38:44.180
We got called out and we were in a suburban neighborhood.

38:44.180 --> 38:45.180
Yeah.

38:45.180 --> 38:46.180
And something terrible happened.

38:46.180 --> 38:49.180
Can you tell me what the terrible thing that happened with the vacuum?

38:49.180 --> 38:50.180
Yeah.

38:50.180 --> 38:54.180
Those kids, they got hit by the goo.

38:54.180 --> 38:55.180
Yeah.

38:55.180 --> 38:56.180
Yeah.

38:56.180 --> 38:58.180
And then we didn't tell nobody about it.

38:58.180 --> 39:00.180
John, what the fuck?

39:00.180 --> 39:02.180
And I hugged you in front of me.

39:02.180 --> 39:03.180
Watch my scars.

39:03.180 --> 39:04.180
Watch my scars.

39:04.180 --> 39:07.180
Thomas, roll alertness for me real quick.

39:07.180 --> 39:09.180
68 on a 60.

39:09.180 --> 39:12.180
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.

39:12.180 --> 39:13.180
Damn it.

39:14.180 --> 39:20.180
I told this all to a false Clark.

39:20.180 --> 39:23.180
If I passed the role, I would have known.

39:23.180 --> 39:26.180
He hugged a little harder than Clark Bishop ever would.

39:26.180 --> 39:31.180
As I'm hugging, I'll call you John now, the Kevin body.

39:31.180 --> 39:34.180
I kind of whisper in your ear as I'm hugging you.

39:34.180 --> 39:37.180
Maggie's alive.

39:37.180 --> 39:39.180
That can't be.

39:39.180 --> 39:43.180
John, I just spent the afternoon with, with, with her.

39:43.180 --> 39:44.180
Chief's alive.

39:44.180 --> 39:48.180
I'm fucking working for her now, man.

39:48.180 --> 39:50.180
She knows about this stuff.

39:50.180 --> 39:53.180
Hey man, here's an ocean.

39:53.180 --> 40:00.180
I think the chief died, but I think there's other us's.

40:00.180 --> 40:04.180
Do you know what I saw?

40:04.180 --> 40:22.180
I saw your body broken on the ground, shattered, but an old you, an old Clark came by and was

40:22.180 --> 40:26.180
whispering some shit over that body.

40:26.180 --> 40:31.180
These two weird brothers kind of distracted me from investigating further, but there was

40:31.180 --> 40:33.180
another you running around contention.

40:33.180 --> 40:34.180
I remember that.

40:34.180 --> 40:36.180
Is this the same Maggie?

40:36.180 --> 40:38.180
You know, it's Maggie.

40:38.180 --> 40:42.180
Is it our Maggie?

40:42.180 --> 40:44.180
I mean, I thought so.

40:44.180 --> 40:46.180
She, she knew me.

40:46.180 --> 40:49.180
We talked about her and me.

40:49.180 --> 40:52.180
I wink and I say, I know you, but I'm not John.

40:52.180 --> 40:54.180
And I draw my gun.

40:54.180 --> 40:55.180
I'm just kidding.

40:55.180 --> 40:56.180
Oh shit.

40:56.180 --> 40:57.180
Wait.

40:57.180 --> 41:06.180
So you saw me, you saw me dead because I'm not dead.

41:06.180 --> 41:08.180
Now you were as dead as Bob.

41:08.180 --> 41:10.180
Oh, I lift up.

41:10.180 --> 41:23.180
I lift up my shirt and show you what's beneath and you see a hole through my chest, essentially

41:24.180 --> 41:26.180
where my heart should be.

41:26.180 --> 41:27.180
You can see through it.

41:27.180 --> 41:32.180
It says if I had a piercing there, like the skin is all healed around it.

41:32.180 --> 41:34.180
It's like a tunnel through my, through my body.

41:34.180 --> 41:35.180
How big is the diameter?

41:35.180 --> 41:36.180
Oh, fist.

41:36.180 --> 41:37.180
Yeah.

41:37.180 --> 41:38.180
I stick my fist through there.

41:38.180 --> 41:39.180
I did that too, John.

41:39.180 --> 41:41.180
It feels weird.

41:41.180 --> 41:42.180
John.

41:42.180 --> 41:44.180
I don't, I don't have a heart.

41:44.180 --> 41:49.180
Well, that was your one weakness beforehand.

41:49.180 --> 41:52.180
My weakness was I didn't have a daddy, but now I am a daddy.

41:52.180 --> 41:53.180
So I think we're just getting stronger.

41:53.180 --> 41:54.180
John.

41:54.180 --> 41:55.180
I'm happy for you.

41:55.180 --> 41:56.180
I think.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.180
Yeah.

41:57.180 --> 41:58.180
I mean, my back is sore.

41:58.180 --> 41:59.180
I'm older.

41:59.180 --> 42:00.180
My knees kind of hurt.

42:00.180 --> 42:03.180
My penis is not as big, but it's not broken.

42:03.180 --> 42:10.180
So it's kind of a good trade off up until a few minutes ago when I got shot three times,

42:10.180 --> 42:12.180
I felt like a million bucks.

42:12.180 --> 42:13.180
Oh yeah.

42:13.180 --> 42:14.180
I got shot too.

42:14.180 --> 42:21.180
As you guys show your bullet wounds to each other that are just bleeding with no mechanical

42:21.680 --> 42:24.180
disadvantage for you, apparently.

42:24.180 --> 42:26.180
Isn't that nice?

42:26.180 --> 42:27.180
John.

42:27.180 --> 42:35.180
I mean, I don't know why I'm alive, but I woke up with my own heart in a bag and I ran

42:35.180 --> 42:42.180
into Maggie and John, I got to tell you, I'm, I'm working for some people now.

42:42.180 --> 42:47.180
They call themselves the circle of knowledge.

42:47.180 --> 42:50.180
Uh, Clark says it like that cause he feels like it's a mysterious thing.

42:51.180 --> 42:52.180
John rolls his eyes.

42:52.180 --> 42:53.180
Kevin.

42:53.180 --> 42:54.180
Sorry.

42:54.180 --> 42:56.180
Kevin rolls his eyes.

42:56.180 --> 42:58.180
I think we can call you John.

42:58.180 --> 43:00.180
You're technically John Lee Pettymore.

43:00.180 --> 43:06.180
Uh, Maggie's part of them and so it was her dad and we went to a, well guess where they

43:06.180 --> 43:07.180
are?

43:07.180 --> 43:08.180
The mill.

43:08.180 --> 43:09.180
Yeah.

43:09.180 --> 43:10.180
That makes sense.

43:10.180 --> 43:12.180
What was going on with the foot meat?

43:12.180 --> 43:13.180
We didn't get to that.

43:13.180 --> 43:14.180
That's a good one.

43:14.180 --> 43:15.180
Although maybe.

43:15.180 --> 43:17.180
Well, Maggie, does she have a foot?

43:17.180 --> 43:18.180
Did Maggie have a foot?

43:18.180 --> 43:20.180
You didn't notice her not having a foot.

43:20.180 --> 43:21.180
Okay.

43:21.180 --> 43:26.180
Uh, she, as far as I remember, she had both of them feets.

43:26.180 --> 43:28.180
That, that seems like a thing you would have observed.

43:28.180 --> 43:30.180
So I trust you.

43:30.180 --> 43:31.180
Wait, hold on.

43:31.180 --> 43:33.180
That was too Batman.

43:33.180 --> 43:38.180
Let's see how I trust you.

43:38.180 --> 43:39.180
Good.

43:39.180 --> 43:42.180
You need, you need both feet and nobody wants a feet getting it.

43:42.180 --> 43:44.180
I said it two times.

43:44.180 --> 43:45.180
Am I going to say it again?

43:45.180 --> 43:46.180
Getting it.

43:46.180 --> 43:47.180
Getting it.

43:47.180 --> 43:51.180
Do you remember and see Keith Vigna just eating some of the crawfish that's in the

43:51.180 --> 43:53.180
boil in front of the coffin?

43:53.180 --> 43:54.180
I just figured.

43:54.180 --> 43:55.180
Yeah, that sounds right.

43:55.180 --> 43:58.180
I also have some things that I should probably tell both of you.

43:58.180 --> 43:59.180
Yeah.

43:59.180 --> 44:01.380
I was going to say, do you, wait, okay, hang on.

44:01.380 --> 44:02.620
How was I pointed Keith?

44:02.620 --> 44:03.620
How's he alive?

44:03.620 --> 44:04.620
Okay.

44:04.620 --> 44:05.620
You remember Charlie?

44:05.620 --> 44:08.740
Uh, Charlie was Rosemary's partner.

44:08.740 --> 44:09.740
Charles Donovan.

44:09.740 --> 44:10.740
Charles.

44:10.740 --> 44:11.740
Yeah.

44:11.740 --> 44:12.740
Donovan.

44:12.740 --> 44:13.740
Yeah.

44:14.300 --> 44:19.100
Me and this forum, we all have some body modifications that help us.

44:19.100 --> 44:21.760
Well, Rosemary wasn't sure she could die.

44:21.760 --> 44:23.800
She was kind of freaked out that Charles died.

44:23.800 --> 44:27.000
She told me that today, but Keith has the same scars.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
What all of us have.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.760
I don't know if we have arm rockets like that robot.

44:31.760 --> 44:32.760
Let me check it out.

44:32.760 --> 44:35.180
I try to shoot her my hand.

44:35.180 --> 44:40.740
It's that scene where Tobey Maguire is like, go web, go.

44:40.740 --> 44:41.740
It's been a long time.

44:41.740 --> 44:42.740
He shoots the web, right?

44:43.740 --> 44:45.620
All right.

44:45.620 --> 44:46.620
Not in that one.

44:46.620 --> 44:48.380
Stand back.

44:48.380 --> 44:51.500
And I just hold my arm out and nothing happens.

44:51.500 --> 44:52.500
Nevermind.

44:52.500 --> 44:57.700
Oh, so we don't seem to have, we don't, we're not inspector gadgets, but it seems like we

44:57.700 --> 45:00.420
have some combat, some body modifications.

45:00.420 --> 45:04.100
What make us stronger?

45:04.100 --> 45:05.100
So that's cool.

45:05.460 --> 45:13.220
But anyway, I saw some, some figures with funny shaped sides, dragging Keith off Marvin

45:13.220 --> 45:16.720
Glass said that we turned them into the new Charles.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.220
So they made them a murder machine.

45:18.220 --> 45:24.640
I think of some variety of my variety of Rosemary's variety, but not of the robot variety.

45:24.640 --> 45:28.760
So you, you don't have, are you, you have metal in you, John, are you medley?

45:28.760 --> 45:29.980
I try to shoot my hand again.

45:29.980 --> 45:33.180
I'm really like straining.

45:33.180 --> 45:38.540
No, unfortunately I don't think so.

45:38.540 --> 45:43.380
However, when you, when you look at some of the wounds that you have taken, there is some

45:43.380 --> 45:46.500
metal underneath your skin in some places.

45:46.500 --> 45:48.260
Hold on.

45:48.260 --> 45:49.260
What about this tink?

45:49.260 --> 45:53.460
It actually looks like there's some metal.

45:53.460 --> 45:54.460
I see it.

45:54.460 --> 45:55.460
Perhaps some you're shiny.

45:55.460 --> 45:57.140
Perhaps some mechanized self-healing.

45:57.140 --> 45:58.140
I'm not sure.

45:58.300 --> 46:01.700
It looks like a, uh, almost like a, like a, like a dermal layer.

46:01.700 --> 46:03.340
That's all metallic.

46:03.340 --> 46:05.000
That's cool.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.580
If you're okay with it, that's a, I know that I'm on board with you.

46:07.580 --> 46:08.580
That's awesome.

46:08.580 --> 46:09.580
Thanks to tell you.

46:09.580 --> 46:10.580
Let's talk to that's Brent.

46:10.580 --> 46:14.700
That's rope Keith in on this and regarding Marvin glasses, ultimate emissions.

46:14.700 --> 46:16.860
I'll tell you what Maggie wants.

46:16.860 --> 46:27.660
I've been waiting since December, 2017 to learn that Clark and John walk over to Keith,

46:27.660 --> 46:31.020
who is at the crawfish station.

46:31.020 --> 46:35.420
I am shoving my, I'm peeling crawfish.

46:35.420 --> 46:40.000
I'm hurting my hands cause they're still in the, like whoever was running this crawfish

46:40.000 --> 46:42.900
boil is long gone.

46:42.900 --> 46:45.180
So I'm, there's no utensils or anything.

46:45.180 --> 46:51.620
So I'm just like quickly dipping my hand into the boiling crawfish water and grabbing crawfish

46:51.620 --> 46:54.100
and just slamming them into my mouth.

46:54.100 --> 46:55.100
It's our key.

46:55.100 --> 46:56.100
That's Keith.

46:56.100 --> 46:57.100
It's him.

46:57.540 --> 46:58.540
Yeah.

46:58.540 --> 46:59.540
The proof is there.

46:59.540 --> 47:05.660
Guys, maybe, I mean bubble gum tree, but now I'm going to say crawfish boil.

47:05.660 --> 47:06.660
Anyway.

47:06.660 --> 47:07.660
Yeah.

47:07.660 --> 47:10.380
So I've, I've got just shit all over my face.

47:10.380 --> 47:24.020
I've been really, I've got, I'm like, no, I've got just crawfish, you know, like shell

47:24.020 --> 47:27.540
on my face and just spices and everything.

47:27.540 --> 47:32.500
Cause I mean, you guys were talking over there for a minute, so I was just going to town

47:32.500 --> 47:33.500
on this.

47:33.500 --> 47:36.500
My, my, also my fingers are like, they're very red.

47:36.500 --> 47:42.020
I'm going to take one hit point of, of damage.

47:42.020 --> 47:45.780
I'm going to do that for the sake of the, what does that put your hit points at?

47:45.780 --> 47:46.780
I'm zero.

47:46.780 --> 47:59.620
I am currently at 25 out of 25, so I'm just for the sake of that bit, I'm taking one.

47:59.620 --> 48:00.620
All right.

48:00.620 --> 48:01.620
That's going to end like six months.

48:01.620 --> 48:07.980
We're going to be like, you motherfucker, it's going to come back to bite you so hard.

48:07.980 --> 48:08.980
Oh fuck.

48:08.980 --> 48:09.980
Yeah.

48:09.980 --> 48:15.340
So my fingers hurt, but I am pleased with this crawfish boil.

48:15.340 --> 48:16.340
Yeah.

48:16.900 --> 48:22.540
To Keith and I look at you and I'm just peeling a crawfish open and Keith, do you, do you

48:22.540 --> 48:24.580
know who, who, who this is?

48:24.580 --> 48:27.460
And I gestured to the guy standing there with us.

48:27.460 --> 48:30.460
I mean, I give an awkward smile in a way of Kevin.

48:30.460 --> 48:31.460
That's Marvin's body.

48:31.460 --> 48:32.460
Oh, okay.

48:32.460 --> 48:36.860
I walk up to Keith and I get right by his ear and I whisper in his ear.

48:36.860 --> 48:39.860
I'm like, I know what you did to my Smokies.

48:39.860 --> 48:42.040
Now, now do you know Keith?

48:42.040 --> 48:44.660
And I punch him in the gut.

48:44.660 --> 48:52.080
I spit out the crawfish that's in my mouth.

48:52.080 --> 48:57.100
When you said bubblegum tree, I thought maybe John Lee Pettymore had told you to say that,

48:57.100 --> 49:02.500
but only John knows about the Smokies.

49:02.500 --> 49:10.500
I get back up from you punching me in the gut and I look at you and I give you a hug.

49:10.500 --> 49:13.860
So did I.

49:14.280 --> 49:21.320
And I look at Clark and I look over at John Lee Pettymore and just a big, big smile comes

49:21.320 --> 49:22.320
across my face.

49:22.320 --> 49:25.800
I'm like, boys, we did it.

49:25.800 --> 49:30.800
Listen boys, it's not quite over yet.

49:30.800 --> 49:33.160
I learned a little bit.

49:33.160 --> 49:34.160
Marvin Glass.

49:34.160 --> 49:36.660
This is all some business play to him.

49:36.660 --> 49:40.480
He wants to demolish contention so we can have a land.

49:40.740 --> 49:47.020
At least it's what I extrapolated from what I heard, but we're not done yet boys.

49:47.020 --> 49:48.660
We got to save the town.

49:48.660 --> 49:51.420
John, it might be even bigger than the town.

49:51.420 --> 49:57.020
Hey, uh, hey Keith, Maggie, she's, she's still alive.

49:57.020 --> 50:01.440
No, I saw her dead with my own two eyes.

50:01.440 --> 50:03.420
I saw you dead with my own two eyes, Keith.

50:03.420 --> 50:06.200
I saw you both dead with my own two eyes.

50:06.200 --> 50:08.180
Also now I'm in another body.

50:08.180 --> 50:10.180
Somebody else's eyes.

50:10.180 --> 50:16.440
Well, boys, we have been through some of the weirdest shit ever, so you know, I believe

50:16.440 --> 50:17.440
it.

50:17.440 --> 50:18.440
What's she doing?

50:18.440 --> 50:19.440
What's she into?

50:19.440 --> 50:20.980
Well, how's she?

50:20.980 --> 50:22.160
She showed me things.

50:22.160 --> 50:23.160
Maggie did?

50:23.160 --> 50:24.160
Our babies.

50:24.160 --> 50:25.160
Slap.

50:25.160 --> 50:26.160
No.

50:26.160 --> 50:31.840
You got some Kevin still left in you.

50:31.840 --> 50:37.680
She showed me this, as I'm describing this to you guys, uh, any kind of a joviality about

50:37.680 --> 50:41.660
running into you guys again, a freaked out in this and anything like that is washing

50:41.660 --> 50:46.540
away from my face and it's mortal terror as I describe.

50:46.540 --> 50:57.940
She showed me a creature I'd never, it wasn't boys, it's a, we got it.

50:57.940 --> 50:58.940
We got to stop it.

50:58.940 --> 51:03.060
It's a, I can't just, I can't describe it.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.500
I start to, I start to cry a little bit.

51:05.500 --> 51:08.080
It, it wants, it wants this.

51:08.080 --> 51:15.160
It wants, I don't, I put my, I put my hand on Clark's shoulder, squeeze it kind of too

51:15.160 --> 51:17.600
hard and I'm like, just tell us what you saw.

51:17.600 --> 51:19.740
I take two steps back from the group.

51:19.740 --> 51:23.160
It's a Maggie works for a group.

51:23.160 --> 51:25.040
I, I work for a group now.

51:25.040 --> 51:33.440
It's their only mission is to make it make what I saw not be a thing and boy, if you'd

51:33.440 --> 51:35.920
got seen it too, you would have, you would have jumped.

51:35.920 --> 51:38.500
You would have jumped when they said jump.

51:38.500 --> 51:39.540
And that's what I've been doing.

51:39.540 --> 51:41.020
That's what I'm doing now.

51:41.020 --> 51:42.060
She told me I had to kill him.

51:42.060 --> 51:46.460
So I, I came up here out, I shot him as soon as I saw him.

51:46.460 --> 51:48.780
They told you to kill Stan.

51:48.780 --> 51:54.300
She said it would, it would make sure that fucked me over Clark.

51:54.300 --> 51:58.740
Maggie told Maggie told me that, uh, killing Stan would help help make that thing not be

51:58.740 --> 52:00.540
a thing.

52:00.540 --> 52:01.780
So I did.

52:01.780 --> 52:02.940
Do you trust Maggie?

52:02.960 --> 52:09.520
I trust her with my life always have, but after what she showed me, I just know that

52:09.520 --> 52:15.400
she's on the good side, at least as far as making sure that thing isn't, isn't allowed

52:15.400 --> 52:17.640
to do whatever the hell it wanted.

52:17.640 --> 52:24.300
Well, I'm going to tell both of you guys, you might need to be watching my back cause

52:24.300 --> 52:27.840
the glass family is going to be very angry at me.

52:27.840 --> 52:31.280
I don't know that they wouldn't have killed him, but they needed to talk to him.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.280
Yeah.

52:32.900 --> 52:36.700
And the reason I'm still alive is because of the glass family.

52:36.700 --> 52:37.860
They're going to be gunning for me.

52:37.860 --> 52:44.160
I think what, what I was, I was tasked Marvin glass rebuilt me.

52:44.160 --> 52:46.060
I died.

52:46.060 --> 52:50.300
The only reason I'm here right now, when I'm looking at him physically, do I see any metal

52:50.300 --> 52:55.660
when I'm telling you this, I ding on my head and you just hear metal.

52:55.660 --> 52:56.660
It was creepy though.

52:56.660 --> 53:00.380
We actually heard metal.

53:00.400 --> 53:06.360
I point between you and uh, Kevin, John, KJ, he's got metal to Keith.

53:06.360 --> 53:09.920
I mean, we're not invulnerable, but we're less vulnerable.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.440
I think, I think there's metal things.

53:11.440 --> 53:12.440
Pretty cool.

53:12.440 --> 53:16.100
I told him I've got a gnarled old voice now.

53:16.100 --> 53:19.600
I'm like Sam Elliott and roadhouse.

53:19.600 --> 53:20.600
I'm me-o.

53:33.860 --> 53:39.380
Did, did you not get a sexier upgrade?

53:39.380 --> 53:45.420
I just, I hold my left hand up like this and I kind of do a fake fake gun in the air and

53:45.420 --> 53:48.460
I'm like, I got a pretty sexy upgrade.

53:48.460 --> 53:49.760
I'll tell you about that later.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.240
Are you a gun hand?

53:51.240 --> 53:52.240
Nope.

53:52.240 --> 53:55.540
A gun of sorts, but we'll get to that later.

53:55.540 --> 53:56.540
What sorts?

53:56.540 --> 53:57.540
You're being shut up.

53:57.540 --> 53:58.540
You're being mysterious.

53:58.540 --> 54:05.080
I was supposed to bring Manstein back to Marvin glass and that would absolve me from any debt

54:05.080 --> 54:07.460
to him for rebuilding me.

54:07.460 --> 54:14.720
So I'm on your guys's side, but we might have some trouble coming after us.

54:14.720 --> 54:17.560
I've, I've got two things to say.

54:17.560 --> 54:24.260
The first, I'm not sure who saw me in this recent kerfuffle.

54:24.260 --> 54:27.620
I don't know if anybody knows who I was shooting at, but I might be able to.

54:27.620 --> 54:28.800
Are you okay?

54:28.800 --> 54:34.540
By the way, what I mean is if, if we make me less okay, one of you like shoots me in

54:34.540 --> 54:39.180
the leg or something, I might be able to go back and infiltrate the glass organization.

54:39.180 --> 54:41.580
I'm not sure how much Rosemary saw.

54:41.580 --> 54:45.000
I mean, Keith, I talked to Maggie.

54:45.000 --> 54:52.260
I asked her if I could bring you guys into the fold and she says she would trust me.

54:52.260 --> 54:57.540
And if I trusted her and that if I thought you guys could handle it, she's offered to

54:57.540 --> 54:59.100
put me up in the middle.

54:59.100 --> 55:00.620
She says she could protect me.

55:00.620 --> 55:05.180
Keith can't handle it.

55:05.180 --> 55:08.900
I told her she, she, she asked if I thought you guys could handle it and I said, you'd

55:08.900 --> 55:10.540
seen the same things I had.

55:10.600 --> 55:17.840
Well, what I told Marvin Glass leaving his compound was that I would bring Stan back

55:17.840 --> 55:20.120
to him for questioning.

55:20.120 --> 55:25.200
Now that that is not an option, I became a cop for a reason.

55:25.200 --> 55:28.680
I want to do good by people.

55:28.680 --> 55:37.220
And if you think that is the option that is good, I fully want to join you.

55:37.220 --> 55:41.960
I'm just warning you, we're going to have some real bad people after us.

55:41.960 --> 55:45.140
With or without you, Glass is going to be after us.

55:45.140 --> 55:48.080
That doesn't put any more burden on our shoulders, I don't think.

55:48.080 --> 55:49.760
Well then let me come with you.

55:49.760 --> 55:50.760
Yeah.

55:50.760 --> 55:51.760
Hey, come on.

55:51.760 --> 55:52.760
Come on.

55:52.760 --> 55:53.760
Come on.

55:53.760 --> 55:56.000
Let's go kill Marvin Glass.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.160
Whatever the fold is, I want to be brought into it if you think it's good.

56:00.160 --> 56:01.600
Marvin Glass is after you.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.720
Marvin Glass is going to be after all of us.

56:03.720 --> 56:05.560
Our duty is to stop him.

56:05.580 --> 56:10.100
We've been a team for so long, why stop being a team now?

56:10.100 --> 56:11.500
Teamwork make the dream work.

56:11.500 --> 56:15.900
What if the real contention police department was the friends we made along the way?

56:15.900 --> 56:16.900
I wrote that.

56:16.900 --> 56:19.300
That is amazing.

56:19.300 --> 56:20.580
So I always liked you, Clark.

56:20.580 --> 56:21.580
You're so smart.

56:21.580 --> 56:26.500
Well, I guess here's what I'll tell you is that Maggie, she told me that this was my

56:26.500 --> 56:31.260
mission for today and that after I completed it, I could kind of do what I needed to for

56:31.260 --> 56:32.260
a while.

56:32.260 --> 56:35.060
She actually told me to get my affairs in order and contention so that I could move

56:35.060 --> 56:36.580
up to the mill with them.

56:36.580 --> 56:37.900
So I got some time.

56:37.900 --> 56:39.280
I could touch base with her.

56:39.280 --> 56:41.880
Are you planning on going back to contention?

56:41.880 --> 56:44.280
Because guys, I haven't told you this yet.

56:44.280 --> 56:51.960
I had tens of missed calls from Drew and a voicemail that basically said, get as far

56:51.960 --> 56:53.720
away from contention as you can.

56:53.720 --> 56:58.060
Well, I'll tell you my tentative plan was to get back to my place and grab all the guns

56:58.060 --> 57:02.800
and things that we confiscated from my garage and I was going to just move shop up to the

57:02.800 --> 57:03.800
mill.

57:03.800 --> 57:04.800
Get objects and whatnot.

57:04.800 --> 57:07.960
Get everything back in the place.

57:07.960 --> 57:10.720
We had the camera in the car.

57:10.720 --> 57:12.720
It's not in there anymore.

57:12.720 --> 57:14.800
I don't know where the gun is.

57:14.800 --> 57:15.800
We had the camera in the car?

57:15.800 --> 57:16.800
Yeah.

57:16.800 --> 57:21.840
I brought it with me cause I thought maybe around, you know, I think one o'clock it might

57:21.840 --> 57:25.400
be working, but it's not in there anymore.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.160
Did we have the gun in the car?

57:27.160 --> 57:28.160
Yeah, we did.

57:28.160 --> 57:29.440
And the gun's gone too.

57:29.440 --> 57:30.440
It's not in there anymore.

57:30.440 --> 57:32.300
Well, the gun we know who has it.

57:32.300 --> 57:35.700
We brought it up to the meeting, so it's whoever was in that room.

57:35.700 --> 57:36.700
Right?

57:36.700 --> 57:37.700
Yeah.

57:37.700 --> 57:38.700
That's right.

57:38.700 --> 57:39.700
But the camera, it's not in there anymore.

57:39.700 --> 57:40.700
Right.

57:40.700 --> 57:45.340
We might need to run back to the police station and your house to get all this stuff, but

57:45.340 --> 57:50.620
I'm really fingers crossed hoping that at least the helmet and the jukebox is still

57:50.620 --> 57:51.620
there.

57:51.620 --> 57:52.620
The radio.

57:52.620 --> 57:53.620
The radio.

57:53.620 --> 58:00.440
I've got an ocean and you just see, um, Kevin Lee, Patty Moore, he puts his, he puts his

58:00.440 --> 58:04.760
hands to his head and his eyes just kind of go white.

58:04.760 --> 58:06.760
Oh shit.

58:06.760 --> 58:07.760
John.

58:07.760 --> 58:08.760
John.

58:08.760 --> 58:09.760
John.

58:09.760 --> 58:38.080
How am I the only one trying to fool Oh, how can you have my hand

58:38.080 --> 59:04.400
How can you have enough drowning out All I know is there's no more to go
