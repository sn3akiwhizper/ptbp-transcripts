00:00.000 --> 00:08.760
What is up my people, it is your friendly neighborhood DJ Wolf the dog.

00:08.760 --> 00:16.680
As always we are coming at you live and uncut from 694.2 PTPP contentions latest and greatest

00:16.680 --> 00:18.560
radio station.

00:18.560 --> 00:23.160
Wolf is here with some hot scoops of news.

00:23.160 --> 00:27.320
Now the county said that the body from the junkyard had the organs of someone who died

00:27.320 --> 00:32.840
200 years ago but the skin and hair of someone who died yesterday.

00:32.840 --> 00:38.120
Somebody get Ripley's Believe It or Not on the line because that is some unbelievable

00:38.120 --> 00:39.120
shit.

00:39.120 --> 00:44.400
Charles, a drunk man and friend of the missing John Peters went to the police station to

00:44.400 --> 00:49.120
get answers before pulling a gun and running away upon hearing the sound of a car crash

00:49.120 --> 00:50.400
in the parking lot.

00:50.400 --> 00:58.280
Sounds like it is about to hit the fan and the it is shit my babies.

00:58.280 --> 01:01.240
Kathy Piston shot Keith Vigna in the foot.

01:01.240 --> 01:05.680
He snooped around her property until trying to stow away on her school bus full of homeless

01:05.680 --> 01:06.680
folks.

01:06.680 --> 01:09.600
He heard himself falling from the emergency hatch in the back.

01:09.600 --> 01:13.880
Now sounds like that's what you get for being a damn snoop.

01:13.880 --> 01:18.660
Now John Lee Patymore seems to believe some hooded robot man gave him a message.

01:18.660 --> 01:22.260
Now we've all had a dream like that before am I right fellas.

01:22.260 --> 01:23.820
Now about that crash.

01:23.820 --> 01:28.900
Seems to have been a stolen black SUV t-boning George Piston's truck while it was parked

01:28.900 --> 01:30.580
in the police station lot.

01:30.580 --> 01:33.820
Now how drunk you gotta be to hit a parked car?

01:33.820 --> 01:39.460
Now I want y'all to tell your mama, tell your papa, there's a new band in town and it is

01:39.460 --> 01:43.380
kudzu with no backbone.

02:09.460 --> 02:15.740
Keith Vigna give me a drive roll at a minus 20.

02:15.740 --> 02:18.180
Hell yeah I love that.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.580
Oh I passed a 13 on a 20.

02:20.580 --> 02:28.620
You come sliding out drift style into the county road that the black SUV is on and you

02:28.620 --> 02:35.840
are immediately in pursuit alongside two other police cruisers and the black SUV is taking

02:35.840 --> 02:43.120
off and takes a left into the entrance for the water park splashylvania.

02:43.120 --> 02:48.400
So you guys pull up to the entrance of the vampire themed water park and see a large

02:48.400 --> 02:54.420
wooden sign that reads splashylvania in all caps above a cartooned vampire wearing floral

02:54.420 --> 02:56.960
swimming trunks and riding a surfboard.

02:56.960 --> 03:03.500
A caption bubble extends from the summertime villain's mouth that says you'll want to splash

03:03.500 --> 03:08.780
your buds.

03:08.780 --> 03:14.980
And below this delightful signage is a black SUV that is crashed into the turnstiles at

03:14.980 --> 03:15.980
the entrance.

03:15.980 --> 03:17.660
What do you guys want to do?

03:17.660 --> 03:19.380
Can we tell if it is occupied?

03:19.380 --> 03:24.500
Doors on the left side on the driver's side are both open and there seems to be no one

03:24.500 --> 03:25.500
in the SUV.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.900
I want to pull up and check out what's inside of the SUV.

03:28.900 --> 03:32.920
I'd pull up in a like whatever the formation would be to keep the car pinned if it were

03:32.920 --> 03:34.320
to suddenly back up.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.320
Awesome.

03:35.320 --> 03:36.320
Same.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.800
Approaching the black SUV when you look inside there doesn't seem to be much in it.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.640
It's a pretty clean car.

03:41.640 --> 03:46.080
There are no people inside this black SUV.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.840
But there's animals and things?

03:47.840 --> 03:48.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:48.840 --> 03:49.840
Tons of animals.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.320
There's squirrels everywhere.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.320
And a dragon.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.320
Objects.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.320
There's no people.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.200
There's a dragon.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.200
Roll initiative.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.680
There's some paper towels.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.680
Dragons are spooky.

04:02.680 --> 04:04.680
Thanks mom.

04:04.680 --> 04:05.680
Thanks mom.

04:05.680 --> 04:06.680
Thanks mom.

04:06.680 --> 04:12.080
So walking into the empty park you see signs for a couple different rides.

04:12.080 --> 04:18.880
There is the Two Fanged Plunge, Holy Water Falls, and a ride called The Stake, which

04:18.880 --> 04:24.480
is a log flume ride but the front of the boat is sharpened and at the bottom of the ride's

04:24.480 --> 04:28.680
steep drop there is a massive ornate heart the riders float through.

04:28.680 --> 04:29.680
Awesome.

04:29.680 --> 04:30.680
That's badass.

04:30.680 --> 04:37.800
Yeah, I mean I know we're here to do a job but I fucking love the Stake.

04:37.800 --> 04:43.000
Go ahead and roll alertness for me.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Quit fail.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
I pass.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
47 on a 70.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Pass with 4.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
I got an 88.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Nice.

04:49.000 --> 04:56.360
Alright, so John and Clark, the two of you see all the villains while Keith walks over

04:56.360 --> 04:57.360
his shoelaces.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.360
Oh wait.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.960
Yeah, if you want to describe what you're doing.

05:00.960 --> 05:04.160
Well, I'm going to switch out the dice first off.

05:04.160 --> 05:10.160
Second off, yeah, I got shot in the foot and so I'm going to hop it on one leg.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.160
God damn.

05:12.160 --> 05:14.160
Kathy shot me in the foot.

05:14.160 --> 05:15.160
Why?

05:15.160 --> 05:17.160
Oh, I have a lot to tell you.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.160
Can it wait?

05:19.160 --> 05:23.160
It can wait but it's pretty important but I'll let you know later.

05:23.160 --> 05:27.160
Well, I guess Clark and I will pursue on foot but...

05:27.160 --> 05:28.160
I'll hop behind.

05:28.160 --> 05:33.160
Okay, so the two of you would see across the park, it's a really small water park, but

05:33.160 --> 05:40.760
across it you see standing atop the two-fanged plunge is Julie Maxwell in a hospital gown

05:40.760 --> 05:44.560
with a terrified Leo piston kneeling in front of her.

05:44.560 --> 05:50.080
Leo is kneeling at the top of the water slide where a rider would wait impatiently for a

05:50.080 --> 05:55.880
tanned teen to give them the green light and Julie Maxwell cackles into the night sky and

05:55.880 --> 06:07.720
screeches the world is not our own and little else matters except for the black shiny devil

06:07.720 --> 06:14.700
and the underground temple from which it shall rise but if there's a tiny chance that justice

06:14.700 --> 06:22.920
matters then my sister deserves this fat fuck to bleed out and die and she fires and you

06:22.920 --> 06:28.480
see a spray of red explode out of Leo piston's stomach and his body slumps forward and begins

06:28.480 --> 06:36.240
sliding down the steep yellow slide, a streak of red trailing, his flinching body roll sanity.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.680
I failed.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.560
I passed with a one.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.560
Is that?

06:41.560 --> 06:42.560
Oh, that's a crit.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.560
Yeah, yeah.

06:43.560 --> 06:44.560
I passed with a six.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.960
That means everyone who's your friend gains one.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.240
No, I failed.

06:48.240 --> 06:51.760
Okay, so if you succeed, you lose no sanity.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.640
If you failed, you lose one sanity.

06:54.640 --> 06:55.640
What do you guys do?

06:55.640 --> 06:56.640
Open fire on Julie.

06:56.640 --> 06:57.640
I think that's what...

06:57.640 --> 06:58.640
She just shot a dude.

06:58.640 --> 06:59.640
I think she's going down.

06:59.640 --> 07:00.640
Yeah.

07:00.640 --> 07:01.640
Okay.

07:01.640 --> 07:02.640
Roll firearms, everybody.

07:02.640 --> 07:03.640
21.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.640
On a 60.

07:04.640 --> 07:05.640
Holy fuck.

07:05.640 --> 07:06.640
I rolled a one again.

07:06.640 --> 07:07.640
Oh my God.

07:07.640 --> 07:08.640
Holy shit.

07:08.640 --> 07:16.200
Before any of us get our guns out, Clark has just shot her right through the eye.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.200
Yeah.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.080
Do you want to narrate it or...

07:19.080 --> 07:20.840
I mean, it's that.

07:20.840 --> 07:27.820
As soon as that blood spray hits, I'm already efficiently out, gun drawn with a pistol from

07:27.820 --> 07:28.820
this far away.

07:28.820 --> 07:29.820
Yeah.

07:29.820 --> 07:31.640
Just took a luck shot and nailed her.

07:31.640 --> 07:36.920
Went right through her left eye and the back of her head just explodes through.

07:36.920 --> 07:37.920
A reflex.

07:37.920 --> 07:44.520
Clark, obviously, any loss of life is regrettable and not what we want, but that's not the outcome

07:44.520 --> 07:49.100
we desire, but that was tight as fuck.

07:49.100 --> 07:59.640
The body of Julie Maxwell also falls onto the slide and begins sliding down the two-fanged

07:59.640 --> 08:00.640
point.

08:03.640 --> 08:04.640
Oh no.

08:04.640 --> 08:13.760
And as her body slides to the bottom of the slide where Leo Piston's body also sits, you

08:13.760 --> 08:23.180
see the bodies of both Julie Maxwell and Leo Piston are picked up and slammed into

08:23.180 --> 08:28.520
the ground repeatedly and at an absurd rate by some unseen force.

08:28.520 --> 08:33.840
And then, as if they were never there at all, their bodies are gone.

08:33.840 --> 08:34.840
Roll Sanity.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.280
Crit success.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.280
Nice.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.280
Fail.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.280
I pass.

08:42.800 --> 08:43.800
I don't know how though.

08:43.800 --> 08:44.800
Yeah, no.

08:44.800 --> 08:49.160
That was honestly one of the most, just Terry and you say that, was one of the more fucked

08:49.160 --> 08:52.360
up things I've heard in Delta Green.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.880
I don't know how to explain being okay with seeing that.

08:54.880 --> 08:55.880
Exactly.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.200
Visualizing that, there's no way you come out of that all right.

08:58.200 --> 09:05.800
John Lee Pettymore, you are going to lose one sanity, but gain some terrifying insight.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.560
And who failed?

09:07.560 --> 09:08.560
I did.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.560
Keith Wigner failed.

09:09.560 --> 09:10.560
Clark.

09:10.560 --> 09:11.560
Just a regular pass.

09:11.960 --> 09:17.360
So, Clark, you were going to roll one D4 and you lose four sanity.

09:17.360 --> 09:20.080
Keith Wigner, I need you to roll a D4 as well.

09:20.080 --> 09:21.080
One.

09:21.080 --> 09:27.520
One plus four is five and you lose five sanity.

09:27.520 --> 09:32.680
I need Joe and Thomas to leave the room.

09:32.680 --> 09:33.680
No.

09:33.680 --> 09:36.680
Get the fuck out.

09:36.680 --> 09:37.680
Luke?

09:37.680 --> 09:38.680
Who?

09:39.680 --> 09:40.680
Luke?

09:40.680 --> 09:41.680
Who?

09:41.680 --> 09:43.680
Keith Wigner.

09:43.680 --> 09:51.360
Covering the ground where Julie Maxwell and Leo Piston's bodies just existed, there is

09:51.360 --> 09:58.000
now black, shiny, viscous sludge.

09:58.000 --> 10:07.040
Seemingly inside this muck is the thrashing bodies of Julie Maxwell and Leo Piston.

10:07.040 --> 10:13.880
Their hands reach out, trying to escape this thing that has trapped them, but their struggle

10:13.880 --> 10:16.080
does not last long.

10:16.080 --> 10:23.840
Their limbs seem to fold into this ooze, becoming one with the sentient mass of goop that is

10:23.840 --> 10:27.280
now sliding across the ground toward you.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.640
What do you do?

10:30.640 --> 10:33.000
I hop away.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.960
I forgot your fucking name.

10:36.960 --> 10:37.960
Okay.

10:37.960 --> 10:38.960
Perfect.

10:38.960 --> 10:45.400
I literally 180 and just start pogo sticking my way towards my car.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.400
Okay.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.720
Do you say anything to the other two?

10:48.720 --> 10:51.320
I just, I scream at the top of my lungs.

10:51.320 --> 10:54.960
We'll wait for them to come back.

10:54.960 --> 10:59.760
Keith Wigner, if you would like to describe your actions.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.760
And I run off.

11:00.760 --> 11:01.760
I hop off.

11:02.400 --> 11:06.760
He begins hopping as fast as he can in the opposite direction.

11:06.760 --> 11:09.600
Did he just Wile E. Coyote out here?

11:09.600 --> 11:19.760
That's never, I mean, that's aside, that's the Wile E. Coyote sound.

11:19.760 --> 11:23.680
I've never seen a one footed man move so quickly.

11:23.680 --> 11:28.260
Well, it seems like Keith might need a mental health day, Clark.

11:28.260 --> 11:31.680
So he takes off running, screaming, hopping, hopping, hopping, screaming.

11:32.680 --> 11:37.320
I'm probably still a little bit in shock that I just shot and killed her and then saw that

11:37.320 --> 11:38.320
crazy shit.

11:38.320 --> 11:41.280
I don't know if I even notice him running off.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.280
I cautiously approached the pool where they landed.

11:44.280 --> 11:45.520
Yeah, I'm with him.

11:45.520 --> 11:49.600
Did anything fall out of their pockets while their bodies were being?

11:49.600 --> 11:51.640
Is there gore on the sidewalk?

11:51.640 --> 11:52.640
Yes.

11:52.640 --> 11:53.640
Yeah.

11:53.640 --> 11:54.640
Yeah.

11:54.640 --> 11:59.700
Blood and viscera is sitting at the bottom of where like the pool of water that you splash

11:59.740 --> 12:04.700
into at the bottom of a water slide is, there's now a pool of blood.

12:04.700 --> 12:05.700
Jesus.

12:05.700 --> 12:08.460
Well, it's not great.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.460
What the, what the fuck?

12:10.460 --> 12:16.460
You ever, you ever, you ever seen anything like that before?

12:16.460 --> 12:17.460
Yes.

12:17.460 --> 12:18.460
I'm sorry.

12:18.460 --> 12:19.460
No.

12:19.460 --> 12:21.700
Where'd, where'd the bodies go?

12:21.700 --> 12:23.260
Your guess is as good as mine, Clark.

12:23.260 --> 12:26.260
I look up.

12:26.820 --> 12:32.820
Listen, frankly, none of this seemed too weird to me.

12:32.820 --> 12:39.180
I've inexplicably kept a cool and level head throughout all this.

12:39.180 --> 12:44.660
John, I think you were rationalizing in your head a way for this to be, well, some air

12:44.660 --> 12:52.380
currents came up from the, uh, the subterranean waterways underneath the park.

12:52.380 --> 12:56.820
They got caught, uh, you know, above a great kind of like, you know, Marilyn Monroe's

12:56.820 --> 13:03.260
score score score, Marilyn Monroe's skirt, how it got thrown up in the air by that.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.260
Yeah.

13:04.260 --> 13:05.260
By that old great.

13:05.260 --> 13:07.500
I think something like that happened here repeatedly with two bodies.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.500
That makes sense.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.500
Of course.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.500
It makes sense.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.500
Yeah.

13:11.500 --> 13:16.500
Looking back, you guys see Keith is still hopping as fast as he can and he is finally

13:16.500 --> 13:18.140
bouncing dot in the distance.

13:18.140 --> 13:20.780
He's, he's, he's out of the spot by now.

13:20.780 --> 13:21.780
I holler.

13:22.180 --> 13:23.180
Hey Keith!

13:23.180 --> 13:24.180
Hey Keith!

13:24.180 --> 13:25.180
No!

13:25.180 --> 13:30.180
Do you guys not see that shit?

13:30.180 --> 13:33.180
Uh, what do, uh, what do you guys do?

13:33.180 --> 13:36.680
That's a good question.

13:36.680 --> 13:41.620
I think we call, let's just jump right back into some like real low key investigation.

13:41.620 --> 13:42.620
The FBI.

13:42.620 --> 13:43.620
Yeah.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.620
Well, this is a pickle.

13:45.620 --> 13:51.020
I'm going to follow up on that weird camera.

13:51.020 --> 13:52.020
You got it.

13:52.020 --> 13:53.020
You got everything here.

13:53.020 --> 14:02.020
Is there a way to call the president?

14:02.020 --> 14:07.300
As you guys walk back to your police cruisers, uh, the SUV is still sitting there.

14:07.300 --> 14:13.140
And John, as you, um, as you get to your car, uh, you notice that real quick, we shut the

14:13.140 --> 14:15.020
water park down for the day.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.020
Oh yeah.

14:16.020 --> 14:17.020
Yeah.

14:17.020 --> 14:19.460
And you're probably going to call Tim and have him come out.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.980
I think this is definitely federal.

14:22.980 --> 14:23.980
You want me to go higher?

14:23.980 --> 14:24.980
It's Ray.

14:24.980 --> 14:25.980
It's Ray.

14:25.980 --> 14:27.380
No, it's always been Tim.

14:27.380 --> 14:28.380
Yeah.

14:28.380 --> 14:29.380
Ray.

14:29.380 --> 14:32.420
As far as I recall, it's always been Tim.

14:32.420 --> 14:33.420
Yeah.

14:33.420 --> 14:35.660
The guy who does all the stuff for you, like.

14:35.660 --> 14:36.660
That's Tim?

14:36.660 --> 14:37.660
Yeah.

14:37.660 --> 14:38.660
He's Tim now.

14:38.660 --> 14:39.660
Well, it's always been Tim.

14:39.660 --> 14:40.660
It's always been Tim.

14:40.660 --> 14:41.660
Of course it has.

14:41.660 --> 14:42.660
Yes, it always has been.

14:42.660 --> 14:43.660
Cool.

14:43.660 --> 14:44.660
Glad we're all on the same page.

14:44.860 --> 14:50.620
I'm sitting in my cruiser, just like ghost white, staring ahead, sweating.

14:50.620 --> 14:52.740
Have you sought medical attention for your foot yet?

14:52.740 --> 14:58.140
Okay guys, I got to go over a few things with you before we part ways.

14:58.140 --> 15:02.900
Are you leaving the force?

15:02.900 --> 15:06.540
So maybe after today.

15:06.540 --> 15:09.540
So my foot, I probably do need to get this looked at.

15:09.540 --> 15:13.940
Kathy shot me as I was Kathy piston, George's wife.

15:13.940 --> 15:17.980
As I was approaching the house, I thought that they were all, they were gone, but she

15:17.980 --> 15:19.260
was still there.

15:19.260 --> 15:21.500
She shot me in the foot, not realizing it was me.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.580
I went into the farmhouse.

15:23.580 --> 15:25.120
She wrapped my foot up for the time being.

15:25.120 --> 15:28.980
It's okay, but it hurts real bad and I'll probably bleed through these bandages pretty

15:28.980 --> 15:29.980
quick.

15:29.980 --> 15:33.440
But anyway, after she shot me and wrapped me up, she gave me some coffee and then her

15:33.440 --> 15:36.260
alarm went off and she had, she just left.

15:36.260 --> 15:38.500
And so I snooped around, I looked through the farmhouse.

15:38.500 --> 15:42.740
I looked through the small farmhouse that was there that Leo lives in and the barn and

15:42.740 --> 15:47.000
I didn't find anything in any of those classic vigna.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.200
As I was walking to the second house, I saw the big warehouse that they have where all

15:52.200 --> 15:53.200
the pigs are.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.580
I saw that door was open and I saw it close.

15:55.580 --> 16:00.320
And so after I looked in the barn, there were some school buses parked next to the warehouse

16:00.320 --> 16:05.240
and I snuck into one of those school buses to see who came out of the warehouse.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.700
I assumed it was Kathy.

16:06.700 --> 16:10.900
She and about a hundred homeless people got on the bus that I was on, crammed in there

16:10.900 --> 16:12.100
and started driving off.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.100
I freaked out.

16:13.100 --> 16:20.160
I opened up the back door, fell out of it and hopped my way back to the cruiser.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.220
And that's when I ran into you guys.

16:22.220 --> 16:23.220
Holy shit.

16:23.220 --> 16:24.220
Yeah.

16:24.220 --> 16:25.220
It seemed like, Oh wow.

16:25.220 --> 16:29.220
Were they talking?

16:29.220 --> 16:33.460
I was more concerned with not being on that bus anymore because Kathy didn't seem to really

16:33.460 --> 16:34.460
want me around.

16:34.460 --> 16:37.440
Also, I told her I had a warrant, which she, she believed.

16:37.440 --> 16:40.060
So I don't think we're gonna have to deal with that anytime soon.

16:41.020 --> 16:42.420
How do you know they were homeless?

16:42.420 --> 16:43.420
Oh yeah.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.480
Oh, they were, they were homeless.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.780
They weren't wearing suits.

16:46.780 --> 16:47.780
They weren't.

16:47.780 --> 16:48.780
Yeah.

16:48.780 --> 16:49.780
Yeah.

16:49.780 --> 16:53.860
Uh, it didn't smell like pig shit, but it didn't smell not like big shit.

16:53.860 --> 16:54.860
So yeah.

16:54.860 --> 16:57.180
The immediate thought of get me the hell off this bus.

16:57.180 --> 17:00.640
And then as soon as I fell out of the bus, I thought, well, maybe I should have stayed

17:00.640 --> 17:03.060
to see where they were going, but they didn't seem to notice me.

17:03.060 --> 17:04.140
I was hiding in the back.

17:04.140 --> 17:10.040
And so yeah, I hopped my way back to the cruiser and here we are also, uh, did you guys not

17:10.040 --> 17:11.920
see what I saw in there?

17:11.920 --> 17:14.040
Well, John's got to get theory on that.

17:14.040 --> 17:17.480
It was currents of air from the underground.

17:17.480 --> 17:23.560
That's a, that's a great theory, but I saw black viscous goo with Leo and, and Julie

17:23.560 --> 17:28.800
trying to crawl out of it until it sucked them in and, and they disappeared.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.280
You been trying any mushrooms?

17:30.280 --> 17:32.680
I haven't, but I probably lost a lot of blood.

17:32.680 --> 17:36.160
I put my hand to his forehead and feeling for fever.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.200
Ice cold.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.560
He's hallucinating.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.560
I swear to God.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.200
That's why I screamed and hopped off guys.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.200
You didn't see that?

17:43.200 --> 17:44.200
No, no.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.200
Oh God.

17:45.200 --> 17:49.760
I saw a very explainable natural phenomenon that happens all the time.

17:49.760 --> 17:50.760
I got a theory.

17:50.760 --> 17:51.840
I got a theory here.

17:51.840 --> 17:57.520
You know how, uh, that body we've originally found was blunt force trauma on the, on one

17:57.520 --> 18:00.520
side.

18:00.520 --> 18:05.800
That shit that happened to them probably happened to happen to her or it, whatever that body

18:05.800 --> 18:06.800
was.

18:06.840 --> 18:10.600
I understand that there have been two incidences of airborne.

18:10.600 --> 18:14.800
We need to investigate underground air flow.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.220
Perhaps no one is safe.

18:16.220 --> 18:21.160
When I was getting set up back at the station for an interview, we got a call in from the

18:21.160 --> 18:26.000
medical examiner about that body out there in the junkyard.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
It's real weird.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.400
I opened my car door and just throw up out of the side of it and then continue listening

18:31.400 --> 18:32.400
to you.

18:32.400 --> 18:38.640
The sides of it were that of a body that's been dead for a hundred, 200 years, 200 years,

18:38.640 --> 18:44.720
but the skin and hair was deceased as of December 1st yet another perfectly explainable.

18:44.720 --> 18:49.040
I just figured they did something wrong in the testing that, or, but honestly you see

18:49.040 --> 18:50.120
it all the time.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.160
Ancient innards.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.720
It just happens to some folks.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.600
You get all rotted in there because of your lifestyle choice.

18:56.600 --> 19:01.640
I think something is up that we alcohol, which we have never seen before tobacco.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.200
So I need to go to the hospital.

19:03.200 --> 19:07.120
Did one of you guys hear the stuff that Julie was saying up there?

19:07.120 --> 19:08.840
Yeah, I got it down pretty well.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.840
It sounded something like this.

19:10.840 --> 19:13.360
Oh shit.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.160
Oh, Google docs.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.120
Where are you at?

19:18.120 --> 19:23.080
No, this is not what it, no, that's not ringing any bells.

19:23.080 --> 19:27.680
You would remember her so clearly.

19:27.680 --> 19:35.680
The world is not our own and little else matters except for the black shiny devil and

19:35.680 --> 19:39.920
the underground temple from which it shall rise.

19:39.920 --> 19:46.280
But if there's a tiny chance that justice matters, then my sister deserves this fat

19:46.280 --> 19:48.960
fuck to bleed out and die.

19:48.960 --> 19:52.240
This seems pretty shut and dry to me.

19:52.240 --> 19:57.300
You remember that Polaroid you found that had a shiny black thing in it.

19:57.300 --> 20:01.880
And according to Vigna, like shiny black goo, slam these people into the ground.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.820
So I think you're just drawn at straws here.

20:04.820 --> 20:07.840
That seems entirely coincidental.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.260
The world is, the world is full of black goos.

20:10.260 --> 20:16.220
There's oil, there's dark soup, there's yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:16.220 --> 20:17.220
Dark, dark soup.

20:17.220 --> 20:18.980
You're writing this off too quickly.

20:18.980 --> 20:20.460
No, it was dark soup.

20:20.460 --> 20:22.180
He's right.

20:22.180 --> 20:27.520
So as, as you bring up the camera, you were kind of standing in between Vigna's cruiser

20:27.520 --> 20:33.180
and your own and you kind of take a look into yours and the camera that you found in Joey

20:33.180 --> 20:37.740
Maxwell's car, which is in the back of your police cruiser, obviously that red light is

20:37.740 --> 20:41.140
no longer on, but the green light is.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.140
It's turn.

20:42.140 --> 20:43.140
I'd like to inspect the camera.

20:43.140 --> 20:48.140
Has it taken a picture or no, the only thing that's different is that it's green light

20:48.140 --> 20:49.140
instead of red light.

20:49.140 --> 20:50.140
Yeah.

20:50.140 --> 20:51.980
I want to look through it and then I also, I want to feed it a blank Polaroid.

20:51.980 --> 20:53.620
Let's see if we'll take a shot.

20:53.620 --> 20:57.060
So it's actually got the paper like already internally in it.

20:57.060 --> 20:58.060
Cool.

20:58.060 --> 20:59.060
I'd take a picture.

20:59.060 --> 21:00.060
Okay.

21:00.060 --> 21:01.060
Of the water.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.060
What was it?

21:02.060 --> 21:03.060
Two fangs?

21:03.060 --> 21:04.060
That was the steak.

21:04.060 --> 21:05.060
No, no, no.

21:05.060 --> 21:06.060
I thought that's where they, she plunged off two fangs.

21:06.060 --> 21:07.060
Okay.

21:07.060 --> 21:08.060
One went down one thing.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.060
The other went down the other.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.060
Yeah.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.060
Real fast.

21:11.060 --> 21:17.420
Well, I was going to say, does, do any of our cruisers have dash cams or confessionals?

21:17.420 --> 21:19.020
You would have dash cams for sure.

21:19.020 --> 21:19.900
Yeah.

21:19.900 --> 21:22.540
I'm getting into my cruiser and trying to pull up the footage of what all just happened.

21:22.540 --> 21:29.020
So you wouldn't be able to actually see, well, luck, real luck pass.

21:29.020 --> 21:33.880
You would get a very, very slight far away view.

21:33.880 --> 21:38.900
You would see the death of Julie Maxwell as well as the death of Leo piston.

21:38.900 --> 21:39.900
Great shot.

21:39.900 --> 21:44.740
Um, and then you would probably, I feel like the, the shot would be obfuscated.

21:44.740 --> 21:47.260
Is that the word obfuscated?

21:47.260 --> 21:53.980
Yeah, obfuscated by attractions and signage of all sorts, but you would see on the camera

21:53.980 --> 21:57.740
their bodies at the top peak moving around.

21:57.740 --> 21:58.740
Cool.

21:58.740 --> 22:05.660
So John, you walk back with the camera to the two fangs, you hold the camera up and

22:05.660 --> 22:08.400
the viewfinder looks very normal.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.060
You see what you see.

22:11.060 --> 22:16.260
When you click in to take a picture, there is an extremely bright flash that is almost

22:16.260 --> 22:22.620
blinding and as your vision comes back into focus, you see a piece of paper being smoothly

22:22.620 --> 22:25.260
printed out of the bottom of this device.

22:25.260 --> 22:30.180
I'm briefly reminded of reports of brilliant flashes of light coming out of John Peter's

22:30.180 --> 22:31.180
house.

22:31.180 --> 22:32.180
Roll sanity.

22:32.180 --> 22:33.180
Ooh.

22:33.180 --> 22:34.180
87.

22:34.180 --> 22:35.180
Fuck yeah.

22:35.180 --> 22:36.180
Roll a D six.

22:36.180 --> 22:40.900
Oh, you're going to do me like that.

22:40.900 --> 22:41.900
Four.

22:41.900 --> 22:43.300
Lose four sanity.

22:43.300 --> 22:44.300
You're starting to.

22:44.300 --> 22:45.300
I believe.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.500
You're starting to lose it a little bit.

22:48.500 --> 22:56.660
The picture shows a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose.

22:56.660 --> 23:04.620
He is bent over head and hands and stocks that are a shiny black material and fool is

23:04.620 --> 23:07.340
branded into his forehead.

23:07.340 --> 23:12.940
You see an inky black substance all over your hands and dripping onto the ground from the

23:12.940 --> 23:14.900
camera and the picture.

23:14.900 --> 23:19.780
It is pooling on the ground and you could swear it is moving.

23:19.780 --> 23:22.120
When you blink, the substance is gone.

23:22.120 --> 23:28.740
Your hands are clean and you're holding this odd device and this even otter picture.

23:28.740 --> 23:29.740
Let's go ahead and get them back.

23:29.740 --> 23:33.500
Hey, I'm going to talk to them first.

23:33.500 --> 23:37.860
No, I'm going to talk to them first.

23:37.860 --> 23:38.860
Okay.

23:38.860 --> 23:39.860
Sorry.

23:39.860 --> 23:41.860
Hey, how are you doing?

23:41.860 --> 23:42.860
Howdy.

23:42.860 --> 23:43.860
Proceed.

23:43.860 --> 23:44.860
Don't don't.

23:45.820 --> 23:51.180
And Clark, the two of you see an extremely bright flash of light coming from where John

23:51.180 --> 23:52.180
is standing.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.180
I look at Clark.

23:53.180 --> 23:54.180
What the hell was that?

23:54.180 --> 23:55.180
He was taking a picture.

23:55.180 --> 23:57.160
It's the flash of a camera.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.540
It was bigger than a regular flash of a camera.

23:59.540 --> 24:01.060
I don't know what kind of camera you're using.

24:01.060 --> 24:07.940
I guess it was kind of bright.

24:07.940 --> 24:13.740
Is the gate, is the entrance to, uh, is the entrance to, can I fit my cruiser inside of

24:13.740 --> 24:14.740
the water park?

24:15.620 --> 24:16.620
I get out of my car.

24:16.620 --> 24:18.180
John, you get that picture?

24:18.180 --> 24:19.180
John doesn't answer.

24:19.180 --> 24:22.620
He's just kind of staring at a picture in his hands and like the ground around him.

24:22.620 --> 24:23.620
I go walking up.

24:23.620 --> 24:27.620
I'm going to hop out with him too.

24:27.620 --> 24:28.620
Nice.

24:28.620 --> 24:32.020
I think you might want to help Keith.

24:32.020 --> 24:33.020
I'll do that.

24:33.020 --> 24:34.020
I'll go and.

24:34.020 --> 24:35.020
Yeah.

24:35.020 --> 24:38.900
I put my arm around him and three three legged race it.

24:38.900 --> 24:39.900
John.

24:39.900 --> 24:40.900
John, what you got?

24:40.900 --> 24:41.900
I'm not rightly sure.

24:42.060 --> 24:45.060
I look over his shoulder or whatever he's looking at.

24:45.060 --> 24:48.140
I pass him the picture and I look at it with him.

24:48.140 --> 24:52.820
I cover Keith's eyes.

24:52.820 --> 24:58.340
The picture shows a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose.

24:58.340 --> 25:05.260
He is bent over head and hands and stocks that are a shiny black material and fool is

25:05.260 --> 25:07.580
branded into his forehead.

25:07.580 --> 25:08.580
Did you say in stocks?

25:08.580 --> 25:09.580
Like he's hanging?

25:10.260 --> 25:12.260
It was like just directly in front of me, right?

25:12.260 --> 25:13.260
Like where I took the picture.

25:13.260 --> 25:16.540
Like did you just aim it right ahead of you or did you, what do you, the picture's like

25:16.540 --> 25:19.700
super zoomed in seeming you don't really see much around.

25:19.700 --> 25:21.380
I'm like reaching out in front of me.

25:21.380 --> 25:25.820
I'm waving my hand out in front too.

25:25.820 --> 25:26.820
You feel nothing.

25:26.820 --> 25:27.820
You feel the air.

25:27.820 --> 25:28.820
There's not a man there.

25:28.820 --> 25:32.100
John, did you see anything looking through the viewfinder real quick?

25:32.100 --> 25:37.340
The two of you, uh, could you roll sanity for me at seeing this picture?

25:37.340 --> 25:38.340
I pass with a nine.

25:38.340 --> 25:39.340
I hit a snow.

25:39.340 --> 25:40.340
I'm sorry.

25:40.340 --> 25:41.340
I failed.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.340
Totally.

25:42.340 --> 25:43.340
Keith is fine.

25:43.340 --> 25:44.340
And Clark, you lose one sanity.

25:44.340 --> 25:45.340
Keith.

25:45.340 --> 25:47.300
You're probably thinking this isn't a camera.

25:47.300 --> 25:49.800
Maybe it's like a printer of some kind, dude.

25:49.800 --> 25:50.800
This might not be a camera.

25:50.800 --> 25:55.860
It might be like a printer of some kind from a different, well, this sounds crazy, but

25:55.860 --> 25:57.860
like a different dimension.

25:57.860 --> 25:58.860
Now you do sound crazy.

25:58.860 --> 25:59.860
I'm sorry.

25:59.860 --> 26:02.420
What kind of, I lost a lot of blood.

26:02.420 --> 26:04.580
Tell me a little bit about that black goo you saw.

26:04.580 --> 26:07.020
It was like viscous black goo.

26:07.020 --> 26:10.700
They were crawling out of it and it sucked them in and then it, and then I ran away.

26:10.700 --> 26:16.860
Well, three unrelated incidences of black goo are probably just coincidence, but I am

26:16.860 --> 26:24.780
starting to come around to the notion that maybe something strange is happening in contention.

26:24.780 --> 26:28.540
In the picture of the guy in the stocks, is there signs of the water park behind him?

26:28.540 --> 26:30.140
Uh, no, it's really zoomed in.

26:30.140 --> 26:31.140
Oh shit.

26:31.140 --> 26:33.700
You really add the whole back is, is blurry and such.

26:33.740 --> 26:39.500
Uh, John just got a text and when he reads it, Hey God, so I haven't told you, um, when

26:39.500 --> 26:45.460
I went to the hospital, a madman jumped out at me, possibly a man, possibly mechanical,

26:45.460 --> 26:46.460
but he did.

26:46.460 --> 26:48.820
Uh, he gave me a note in binary.

26:48.820 --> 26:51.660
I had, uh, had drew take a look at that.

26:51.660 --> 26:54.900
I think, uh, I think something's going on.

26:54.900 --> 26:55.900
All right.

26:55.900 --> 26:57.380
Here, here's what it says.

26:57.380 --> 27:01.220
The binary, it translates to I killed the cheese pops, John.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.220
John?

27:02.220 --> 27:03.220
That's me.

27:03.220 --> 27:07.740
That's what happened to cheese dad, but death.

27:07.740 --> 27:09.020
What did this guy look like?

27:09.020 --> 27:12.220
He was wearing a hood and he was real scraggly.

27:12.220 --> 27:13.220
You couldn't see his face.

27:13.220 --> 27:14.220
And you know what?

27:14.220 --> 27:16.220
Come to think of it, I don't think I even caught the feller's face.

27:16.220 --> 27:21.620
Does the note look like it's to John or signed by John because John Peters is our missing

27:21.620 --> 27:22.860
man also.

27:22.860 --> 27:24.020
It looks like it's to me.

27:24.020 --> 27:25.020
Cool.

27:25.020 --> 27:30.060
I killed the cheese pops, comma John, not I killed the cheese pops, signed John.

27:30.060 --> 27:31.220
It's addressed to John.

27:31.220 --> 27:32.220
Gotcha.

27:32.220 --> 27:33.220
Fun thing.

27:33.220 --> 27:40.060
Can you guys roll intelligence for me pass pass fail Clark.

27:40.060 --> 27:44.060
You'd still be holding this picture that John just handed you.

27:44.060 --> 27:47.060
You're remembering this face.

27:47.060 --> 27:53.900
It's obviously a little different now and it's got fool branded into its forehead, but

27:53.900 --> 27:55.860
you're pretty sure that's John Peters.

27:55.860 --> 27:59.340
Hey fellas, what's up this year picture.

27:59.340 --> 28:03.300
I think, I think this picture is John, John Peters, our guy who's missing.

28:03.300 --> 28:04.300
God, you're right.

28:04.300 --> 28:05.300
Let me take a look.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.300
I pass it over.

28:06.300 --> 28:08.260
This is the same guy from those pictures in John's house.

28:08.260 --> 28:10.740
What the hell boys.

28:10.740 --> 28:13.280
Is that green light still on the camera or is it red again?

28:13.280 --> 28:14.280
It's red.

28:14.280 --> 28:18.780
John Peters cursed this devil camera, cursed this haunted water park.

28:18.780 --> 28:23.600
You remember that body in the junkyard, it had, what was it branded with?

28:23.600 --> 28:24.600
This is a fool.

28:24.600 --> 28:25.600
Right?

28:25.600 --> 28:26.600
Yeah, this thing does not like fools.

28:26.600 --> 28:27.600
We got some fools on our hands.

28:27.600 --> 28:28.600
Oh God, guys.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Somebody don't like fools.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
It's the BM.

28:34.000 --> 28:42.680
We just need to find out what a fool believes.

28:42.680 --> 28:43.680
Cut in that music.

28:43.680 --> 28:44.680
We'll get those rights.

28:44.680 --> 28:45.680
Yup.

28:45.680 --> 28:46.680
We can definitely afford it.

28:46.680 --> 28:47.680
Call out the dude.

28:47.680 --> 28:48.680
Call out the dude.

28:48.680 --> 28:50.760
I need to get to the hospital.

28:50.760 --> 28:51.760
Oh shit.

28:51.760 --> 28:52.760
Yeah, you're right.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.640
I think I can get myself there, but I'll go with you.

28:55.640 --> 28:56.640
All right.

28:56.680 --> 29:02.600
Yes, I'll stay behind and try to put together this tangled web of mysteries that are certainly

29:02.600 --> 29:05.680
not currently swamping the resources of this small.

29:05.680 --> 29:10.440
While we're at the hospital, maybe we should see if we can get some security footage and

29:10.440 --> 29:15.400
see if we can't find out what the hooded figure guy came from or what he looks like.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.400
What was the hooded figure thing?

29:16.400 --> 29:17.400
The one that handed him the note.

29:17.400 --> 29:18.400
He jumped out of me.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.400
Oh, right, right.

29:19.400 --> 29:20.400
Are you going to the city?

29:20.400 --> 29:21.400
Which one did you go to?

29:21.400 --> 29:24.600
There's a clinic in contention, like in urgent care.

29:24.600 --> 29:25.600
That's where I would go.

29:25.600 --> 29:26.600
Yeah.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.240
Okay, so that was the end of the day basically.

29:29.240 --> 29:32.240
Well, it seems like we've done all we can do today.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.240
I'm going to take an overnight here at the hospital.

29:34.240 --> 29:41.840
Why don't we all just hit the hay, get a good nine or 10, and come back with fresh, yeah.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.240
We took him to the clinic and he's okay?

29:43.240 --> 29:44.240
Yes.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.400
Did I regain any health points?

29:45.400 --> 29:49.080
Can you roll to see if he loses the foot?

29:49.080 --> 29:50.240
Be hilarious if I did.

29:50.240 --> 29:51.520
You don't regain any health.

29:51.520 --> 29:52.960
Okay, but I have a foot?

29:52.960 --> 29:53.960
You do.

29:53.960 --> 29:54.960
Can I walk on it well or no?

29:55.480 --> 29:56.720
No, it's still sprained pretty badly.

29:56.720 --> 29:59.280
But I got crutches or a wheelchair.

29:59.280 --> 30:00.280
Which do you want?

30:00.280 --> 30:01.280
I want a wheelchair.

30:01.280 --> 30:02.280
You've got a wheelchair.

30:02.280 --> 30:03.280
Hell yeah.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.280
That's going to prove problematic.

30:04.280 --> 30:07.240
Okay, I guess we'll just leave you here, Keith.

30:07.240 --> 30:11.400
I mean, I can still get up out of it, you know.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.920
Yeah, but without crutches.

30:13.920 --> 30:17.320
It's a real souped up jazzy.

30:17.320 --> 30:19.600
It's like the one that they had at the clinic.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.920
Yeah, yeah, it's super old.

30:21.920 --> 30:25.800
We just find you a couple of real long sticks.

30:25.800 --> 30:26.800
Cool.

30:26.800 --> 30:29.800
Just in case.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.800
It's just you and me now.

30:31.800 --> 30:35.800
Finally, we can tell the mic what we can't tell the world.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.800
What we can't tell ourselves.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.800
What we never dare admit.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.800
But what we know is true.

30:43.800 --> 30:50.320
So you're sleeping and you're reliving the moment when you saw the black sludge on your

30:50.320 --> 30:55.040
hands and dripping from the odd camera and picture.

30:55.040 --> 31:00.520
Your perception changes and you're out of your body, looking at yourself, staring intently

31:00.520 --> 31:02.200
at your hands.

31:02.200 --> 31:09.000
You see there's the same viscous muck dripping from your eyes and nostrils as you wake up

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
in bed.

31:10.000 --> 31:16.520
Yeah, I can't really get back to sleep after that, so I just say some like very abusive

31:16.520 --> 31:22.880
things to whichever teenagers are playing Call of Duty at this time of night.

31:22.880 --> 31:28.160
I really like, I'm being a dick over voice chat.

31:28.160 --> 31:29.440
Are you good at Call of Duty?

31:29.440 --> 31:30.440
I think he's pretty good.

31:30.440 --> 31:31.440
I think he's probably pretty good.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.440
Yeah.

31:32.440 --> 31:33.440
I think he's put in some hours.

31:33.440 --> 31:34.440
Yeah.

31:34.440 --> 31:35.440
All right, go ahead and grab Luke.

31:35.440 --> 31:36.440
Hey you.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.440
Keith Vigna.

31:37.440 --> 31:38.440
Oh boy.

31:38.440 --> 31:39.440
Shit.

31:39.440 --> 31:40.440
Hey Luke.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.440
Hey.

31:41.440 --> 31:42.440
Keith.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.440
Hey Luke.

31:44.440 --> 31:45.440
Hey.

31:45.440 --> 31:52.320
Keith, your eyes open and you see a woman standing before you in your bedroom.

31:52.320 --> 31:57.560
She's wearing old timey clothing and she stares angrily at you.

31:57.560 --> 32:03.060
She lunges toward you, picking you up and throwing you to the ground.

32:03.060 --> 32:07.800
You fall into the floor of your bedroom and then you wake up in bed.

32:07.800 --> 32:12.000
I rub my eyes and I look around the room and wonder if that was real or not.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.880
But I have seen enough shit that I think it is.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.060
There's no one in your room.

32:16.060 --> 32:17.060
What time is it?

32:17.060 --> 32:18.060
Three in the morning.

32:18.060 --> 32:19.760
I'm going to get up and look around my house.

32:19.760 --> 32:20.760
Just do a quick sweep.

32:20.760 --> 32:21.760
Nothing?

32:21.760 --> 32:22.760
Nothing.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.720
I'm going to lay back down but probably have some trouble falling asleep.

32:24.720 --> 32:25.720
Probably so.

32:25.720 --> 32:28.200
You want to grab Joe for me?

32:28.200 --> 32:29.200
Yep.

32:29.200 --> 32:34.240
Clark, you go to bed that night, you crack open your TV dinner.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.640
It's a Salisbury steak tonight.

32:35.640 --> 32:36.640
Oh.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.080
He was looking forward to it.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.080
Gross.

32:39.160 --> 32:44.160
And you're watching Wheel of Fortune and then you see a man underneath you and you're not

32:44.160 --> 32:45.160
on your couch.

32:45.160 --> 32:51.960
The man underneath you is struggling to breathe as you tighten your grip around his neck.

32:51.960 --> 32:58.520
You look up after the life leaves his eyes and see an empty dark alleyway as you wake

32:58.520 --> 33:02.200
up on the couch with infomercials playing on your TV.

33:02.200 --> 33:05.400
Oh, what the hell was that?

33:05.400 --> 33:06.400
Yeah.

33:07.400 --> 33:11.240
Yeah, you probably clean up, try to go to sleep.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.240
Yeah, go to the bedroom.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.240
Sounds good.

33:13.240 --> 33:19.880
Okay, so you guys get up and you meet at the police station around the normal time.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.880
11, 11.30.

33:21.880 --> 33:22.880
Eight o'clock for Clark.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.280
You know when crime starts.

33:24.280 --> 33:26.080
Eight o'clock for Clark Bishop.

33:26.080 --> 33:28.520
A little bit later for the other two probably.

33:28.520 --> 33:32.440
I think today I get there on time because I didn't really go to sleep last night.

33:32.440 --> 33:33.440
Gotcha.

33:33.440 --> 33:35.000
I get there late but for the same reason.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.320
Drew seems to be in pretty low spirits after the events of the past two days.

33:40.320 --> 33:41.800
Today is December 3rd.

33:41.800 --> 33:45.040
Been two days since all this crazy stuff has started.

33:45.040 --> 33:49.760
How'd you sleep last night, Clark?

33:49.760 --> 33:52.440
I mean I had some nightmares.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.560
I think everybody's gonna have some.

33:54.560 --> 33:57.360
Yeah, well what, along what lines?

33:57.360 --> 33:58.520
After what we saw.

33:58.520 --> 33:59.520
What happened?

33:59.520 --> 34:03.480
Oh, I saw a dark alley.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.760
It was just real spooky.

34:05.760 --> 34:10.600
Yeah, I had a dream that like an old time lady picked me up and threw me through my

34:10.600 --> 34:11.600
floor.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.680
Yeah, it was really scary.

34:13.680 --> 34:17.280
Do we really need to hear about your fucked up sexual fantasies?

34:17.280 --> 34:20.200
Did you have any fucked up sexual fantasies last night?

34:20.200 --> 34:24.280
He like wipes at his eyes like without really thinking about it and says no.

34:24.280 --> 34:26.440
Okay, must just be the two of us then.

34:26.440 --> 34:31.200
I mean yeah, you see anything as violent as what happened last night, you're gonna think

34:31.200 --> 34:32.200
about it.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.200
Some weird dream.

34:33.240 --> 34:36.400
Your body's just trying to process what you've gone through.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.400
That's all it is.

34:37.400 --> 34:41.760
Drew, have you heard from Maggie, or Officer Cook?

34:41.760 --> 34:42.760
Captain Cook?

34:42.760 --> 34:43.760
Chief Cook?

34:43.760 --> 34:51.080
No, I've called the Chief quite a few times, but I haven't been able to get a hold of her.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.080
Could you call her dad?

34:52.080 --> 34:54.080
Yeah, hey Drew buddy.

34:54.080 --> 34:58.000
We kind of forgot to mention her dad might be dead, if you could look into that.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
The Chief's father?

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Yeah, Pops.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.120
Okay, yeah, I'll look into it.

35:02.120 --> 35:03.120
Great.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.240
You didn't do it right?

35:05.240 --> 35:08.240
Just playing.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.320
John's eyes narrow a little bit though as he looks at Drew.

35:10.320 --> 35:14.560
Doing a role he meant.

35:14.560 --> 35:17.160
Crit success.

35:17.160 --> 35:20.100
He's so scared that you might be serious.

35:20.100 --> 35:22.920
John knows that and revels in it a little bit.

35:22.920 --> 35:27.040
You guys have never really been on great terms, and so he's like ugh.

35:27.040 --> 35:31.080
John's not a great guy.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.080
No shit.

35:32.080 --> 35:38.400
Okay, I'm thinking I kind of want to follow up on this whole, the homeless people at the

35:38.400 --> 35:40.600
Pistons house and their warehouse.

35:40.600 --> 35:45.680
I don't know if we should go ask them about that, or if we should just do a little investigating.

35:45.680 --> 35:48.640
We saw Leo Piston die last night.

35:48.640 --> 35:49.640
That is true.

35:49.640 --> 35:50.640
Maybe we should leave him alone.

35:50.640 --> 35:52.640
That probably closes that thread.

35:52.640 --> 35:59.040
I feel like we should maybe try to figure out some more stuff before we talk to the

35:59.040 --> 36:00.040
Pistons.

36:00.040 --> 36:01.040
Right, maybe we'll have some cool down.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.520
Look at all those homeless people.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.600
There's only 5,000 folks in this whole town.

36:04.600 --> 36:07.600
Has anyone notified the Pistons about Leo?

36:07.600 --> 36:10.480
I haven't, and I don't know if we should just yet.

36:10.480 --> 36:17.360
It would be probably strange for you guys to confront George and Kathy with the death

36:17.360 --> 36:20.200
of George's brother without a body.

36:20.200 --> 36:22.480
There is a pool full of his gore.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.920
Let's just leave it be for now.

36:23.920 --> 36:24.920
Take him to there.

36:24.920 --> 36:25.920
Yeah, here's what.

36:25.920 --> 36:28.440
There's a little bit of a scalp.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.200
Here's what I'm thinking.

36:30.200 --> 36:36.320
That last picture we saw was of John Peters, so maybe we should go back to that case and

36:36.320 --> 36:37.800
see what happened to him.

36:37.800 --> 36:42.880
Honestly, the branding, the stocks, I think we've got some kind of deviant sex cult on

36:42.880 --> 36:50.200
our hands just fucking degrading this town, this town, each other, this town, our values,

36:50.200 --> 36:51.200
faces.

36:51.200 --> 36:56.120
Should we go back to John Peters' house, or what do you, I don't even know what strings

36:56.120 --> 36:57.120
to pull.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.320
John pulls out the keys.

36:58.320 --> 37:02.660
I had a hunch that these might be a storage unit on these G numbers here.

37:02.660 --> 37:09.360
There's a note on your desk, John, that the storage unit that these keys are likely for

37:09.360 --> 37:11.160
is called A Plus Storage.

37:11.160 --> 37:15.640
They're the only storage units in town that have a G building.

37:15.640 --> 37:25.560
I'll ride with one of you guys, because it feels real bad, but I got a wheelchair I can

37:25.560 --> 37:27.440
fold up and throw in the back of your cruiser.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.240
That's those cool sticks we found.

37:29.240 --> 37:31.120
Yeah, they were all out of the clinic.

37:31.120 --> 37:33.800
Yeah, they've had shortages on crutches.

37:33.800 --> 37:38.120
I took one of the wheelchairs, so I'll throw that in the back of your cruiser and ride

37:38.120 --> 37:39.120
with you, Clark.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.520
Yeah, that's fine with me.

37:40.520 --> 37:41.520
Cool.

37:41.520 --> 37:44.220
I'm gonna wheel myself over to outside.

37:44.220 --> 37:50.080
You guys roll up to A Plus Storage, and there's a small parking lot with a gate, and there's

37:50.080 --> 37:54.800
a small house looking kind of thing to the right with a front door.

37:54.800 --> 37:58.160
It's a small, probably one-room building.

37:58.160 --> 37:59.480
Their open sign is on.

37:59.480 --> 38:01.200
Okay, what units are these?

38:01.200 --> 38:02.480
What are the numbers on those?

38:02.480 --> 38:03.480
G units.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.040
Which G units are they?

38:05.040 --> 38:06.040
10 through 12.

38:06.040 --> 38:07.040
10 through 12.

38:07.040 --> 38:08.040
Let's go check them out.

38:08.040 --> 38:09.040
Let's start with 10.

38:09.040 --> 38:10.040
Yeah.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.040
What if we all open one, and we open them all at the same time?

38:12.040 --> 38:14.040
I honestly was thinking about that.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.040
Yeah, sure.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.040
Why not?

38:16.040 --> 38:17.320
Don't they come in different sizes?

38:17.320 --> 38:23.320
These are all the ones that are probably 10 foot by 10 foot.

38:23.320 --> 38:24.320
Nice.

38:24.840 --> 38:25.840
From what you can tell.

38:25.840 --> 38:26.840
I can't open one up right now.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.520
I'm gonna sit at my wheelchair and watch you guys open them up.

38:28.520 --> 38:33.160
Yeah, it'd probably be way easier for me to describe it one at a time.

38:33.160 --> 38:39.320
I would actually, if you could lay down the descriptions of each one and then play them

38:39.320 --> 38:40.320
simultaneously.

38:40.320 --> 38:41.320
At the same time.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.320
Gotcha.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.320
Yeah.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.320
We'll get it in post.

38:44.320 --> 38:45.320
We'll wait.

38:45.320 --> 38:46.720
Okay, let's start with 10.

38:46.720 --> 38:47.720
You open up G10.

38:47.720 --> 38:51.400
G10 is filled with crates that are stacked three high.

38:51.480 --> 38:57.520
There is also a pallet on which is sitting a large cube shaped object covered in so much

38:57.520 --> 39:00.680
plastic wrap that its contents are obfuscated.

39:00.680 --> 39:07.640
Each crate is wooden and stamped US Military in all caps on the side.

39:07.640 --> 39:12.960
Inside these crates are guns, ammunition, and heavy weaponry.

39:12.960 --> 39:19.200
This includes pistols, shotguns, rifles, a shoulder mounted anti-aircraft weapon, an

39:19.200 --> 39:25.240
EMP rifle, a grappling gun, a small gun that shoots tracers, lots of grenades, and a few

39:25.240 --> 39:26.240
other items.

39:26.240 --> 39:29.120
Well, this could be the locker of any honest citizen in contention.

39:29.120 --> 39:34.700
You can each come up with anything that you want to be in here in one of these crates

39:34.700 --> 39:38.520
and if you roll for luck and I approve it, then it's in one of the crates.

39:38.520 --> 39:39.520
Okay, cool.

39:39.520 --> 39:40.520
Oh shit.

39:40.520 --> 39:42.600
I want all the things you already said.

39:42.600 --> 39:43.880
Those are already there.

39:43.880 --> 39:44.880
Holy shit.

39:44.880 --> 39:45.880
What the fuck?

39:45.880 --> 39:48.480
Who's got the best, what are our firearms?

39:48.480 --> 39:51.200
You guys each get to come up with one and each roll luck.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.200
Okay.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.200
I don't know what to wish for.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.600
Like a bad ass shotgun, a sniper rifle.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.600
Well, I feel like those are already in there.

39:58.600 --> 39:59.600
I know.

39:59.600 --> 40:00.600
Wasn't that all?

40:00.600 --> 40:01.600
There were shotguns.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.840
There doesn't seem to be a sniper rifle.

40:02.840 --> 40:03.840
So that could be one.

40:03.840 --> 40:07.880
So sniper rifle, there wasn't anti-aircraft and there's an EMP rifle?

40:07.880 --> 40:09.880
There's an EMP rifle, yeah.

40:09.880 --> 40:13.680
Well, that's actually going to come in handy because I do think we're dealing with some

40:13.680 --> 40:14.680
robots.

40:14.680 --> 40:17.360
Do you want to go ahead and roll luck, Thomas, for a sniper rifle?

40:17.360 --> 40:18.360
No.

40:18.360 --> 40:21.920
I want something bigger.

40:21.920 --> 40:22.920
Something more spectacular.

40:22.920 --> 40:26.840
Hey, is there a tank in here under all these crates?

40:26.840 --> 40:29.000
Hey, is there a tank in here?

40:29.000 --> 40:32.560
Is there anything not guns that could be like a nice vision goggles?

40:32.560 --> 40:36.160
It's just one really sweet vintage cotton candy machine.

40:36.160 --> 40:38.880
I mean, it can be anything, guys.

40:38.880 --> 40:41.600
I want that gun from Men in Black, the little tiny one.

40:41.600 --> 40:42.600
The mighty cricket?

40:42.600 --> 40:43.600
Yeah.

40:43.600 --> 40:44.600
Oh, sorry.

40:44.600 --> 40:45.600
Noisy cricket.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.600
We all want noisy crickets.

40:46.600 --> 40:47.600
Too late.

40:47.840 --> 40:48.840
Okay.

40:48.840 --> 40:49.840
Noisy crickets, please.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.440
Does it have to exist on earth?

40:51.440 --> 40:52.440
Tiny powerful guns.

40:52.440 --> 40:54.520
I mean, that's all that is.

40:54.520 --> 40:57.520
I want to roll for a super tiny powerful gun.

40:57.520 --> 40:58.520
Okay.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.400
No, regular tiny super powerful.

41:00.400 --> 41:01.400
Okay.

41:01.400 --> 41:02.400
Go ahead and roll luck.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.400
20.

41:03.400 --> 41:07.520
You find a very tiny, very powerful gun.

41:07.520 --> 41:09.100
Hell yeah.

41:09.100 --> 41:14.440
What about a really sophisticated in-ear communication pieces?

41:14.440 --> 41:15.440
Oh, I hate that.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.440
Yeah.

41:16.440 --> 41:17.440
That might be too game-breaking.

41:17.440 --> 41:18.440
We've already got radios.

41:18.440 --> 41:19.440
We've got radios.

41:19.440 --> 41:20.440
We've got cell phones.

41:20.440 --> 41:23.280
I just thought it would be if we were sneaking around, we could use them.

41:23.280 --> 41:26.080
They like read your thoughts and send them to the other players.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.080
Okay.

41:27.080 --> 41:29.200
These aren't like unnatural items.

41:29.200 --> 41:32.120
These are just crazy technological items.

41:32.120 --> 41:35.640
That's my luck roll, by the way.

41:35.640 --> 41:38.460
I'm randomly rolling.

41:38.460 --> 41:41.200
Thomas just rolled an odd one.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.200
Wait.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.200
Can I change mine?

41:44.200 --> 41:45.200
No.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.200
Oh, fuck.

41:46.960 --> 41:47.960
Give your idea to someone else.

41:47.960 --> 41:54.520
Well, I wanted a really cool wheelchair.

41:54.520 --> 41:59.880
Can I please?

41:59.880 --> 42:01.800
You can convince one of them to do it.

42:01.800 --> 42:05.960
Guys, if one of you wants my really powerful tiny gun, you could get like guns.

42:05.960 --> 42:09.500
You want a turret mounted wheelchair?

42:09.500 --> 42:12.000
I don't know about that.

42:12.000 --> 42:17.340
I want a gigantic fucking 50 cal sniper rifle, the kind that can take down helicopters and

42:17.340 --> 42:18.800
like large trucks.

42:18.800 --> 42:19.800
Roll for it.

42:19.800 --> 42:22.280
Yeah, one.

42:22.280 --> 42:24.080
Please roll for it.

42:24.080 --> 42:25.080
Dude.

42:25.080 --> 42:26.080
Yeah.

42:26.080 --> 42:27.080
It's so good.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.080
If only.

42:28.080 --> 42:29.080
Yeah.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.080
You got it.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.080
Okay.

42:31.080 --> 42:32.080
Joe, what are you thinking?

42:32.080 --> 42:33.080
I don't know.

42:33.080 --> 42:34.080
Mortars.

42:34.080 --> 42:35.080
I didn't know I was going to get a match.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.080
It's a real shame we don't edit this part.

42:36.080 --> 42:39.160
Some people, when they play a game like this, might take a moment to think.

42:39.160 --> 42:40.840
There might be a lot of downtime.

42:40.840 --> 42:41.840
We don't.

42:42.680 --> 42:45.800
You will never hear that because it doesn't happen.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.800
So are you thinking weapons or like a gadget?

42:47.800 --> 42:51.000
I keep waffling back and forth, but I mean either one would be fine.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.760
A waffle iron.

42:52.760 --> 42:53.760
Wish for a waffle iron.

42:53.760 --> 42:57.720
Like a really nice set of golf clubs.

42:57.720 --> 43:00.900
A lifetime supply of the TV dinners.

43:00.900 --> 43:02.540
We should have a mortar.

43:02.540 --> 43:07.280
What about just like a really fancy, cool ass, uh, like revolver?

43:07.280 --> 43:11.080
Just like what's dirty hair you use in that a big ass revolver?

43:11.320 --> 43:12.320
I don't know anything about guns.

43:12.320 --> 43:15.600
I think, I think real big revolver is pretty cool and coppish.

43:15.600 --> 43:17.000
Opposite of what I got.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
But also...

43:18.000 --> 43:21.960
It's a huge, weak gun.

43:21.960 --> 43:27.360
Consider we might have a, uh, a compound like full of hundreds of homeless people.

43:27.360 --> 43:29.280
I think we should get some mortars.

43:29.280 --> 43:30.840
What are you trying to say, John?

43:30.840 --> 43:35.640
I think we should be prepared to shell vast numbers of the enemy.

43:35.640 --> 43:38.160
Who's to say they're the enemy?

43:38.160 --> 43:39.160
Or what about like a drone?

43:39.160 --> 43:40.160
Yeah, right.

43:40.680 --> 43:43.280
The fact that this is a rollpoint armed drone.

43:43.280 --> 43:44.280
They're probably just misunderstood.

43:44.280 --> 43:45.760
Yeah, I don't know.

43:45.760 --> 43:48.280
It's between a drone and a big ass pistol.

43:48.280 --> 43:50.280
Oh dude, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone, drone.

43:50.280 --> 43:51.280
Should I get a drone?

43:51.280 --> 43:52.280
Can I get a drone?

43:52.280 --> 43:53.280
I hope you fail your roll.

43:53.280 --> 43:54.280
But yeah, you can roll.

43:54.280 --> 43:55.280
Pass.

43:55.280 --> 43:56.280
All right.

43:56.280 --> 43:57.280
Yes.

43:57.280 --> 43:58.280
We got a drone.

43:58.280 --> 44:00.880
Yeah, we've got a big ass predator drone.

44:00.880 --> 44:01.880
Okay.

44:01.880 --> 44:03.560
It can be just the...

44:03.560 --> 44:04.560
Pull it back.

44:04.560 --> 44:05.560
All right.

44:05.560 --> 44:06.560
Hey.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.560
It's a nice one though.

44:07.560 --> 44:08.560
It's nice.

44:08.560 --> 44:09.560
Cool.

44:09.960 --> 44:11.960
I'm going to start cutting into that plastic wrapped cube.

44:11.960 --> 44:12.960
Okay.

44:12.960 --> 44:15.160
I want to examine it before.

44:15.160 --> 44:20.240
As you're examining it, you examine Keith Vigna cutting into this giant plastic wrapped

44:20.240 --> 44:21.240
cube.

44:21.240 --> 44:27.680
And as you dig your knife a little bit too far into it, a white powder starts pouring

44:27.680 --> 44:28.680
out of it.

44:28.680 --> 44:29.680
Let me see that.

44:29.680 --> 44:30.680
Step aside.

44:30.680 --> 44:35.720
I roll aside.

44:35.720 --> 44:43.800
As you begin to take off the outer layers of plastic wrap, you would see that this is

44:43.800 --> 44:46.960
bricks upon bricks of cocaine.

44:46.960 --> 44:51.140
Guys, there must be 25, 20 bricks of cocaine here.

44:51.140 --> 44:55.680
It is precisely way more than 25 bricks of cocaine.

44:55.680 --> 44:57.600
This is an entire palette.

44:57.600 --> 45:04.880
And as you begin counting, based on the math that you guys are, I'm assuming, great at

45:04.880 --> 45:11.120
based on your characters, it is precisely 479 bricks of cocaine.

45:11.120 --> 45:12.120
Hell yeah.

45:12.120 --> 45:13.120
Quick math.

45:13.120 --> 45:18.360
I mean, it is 478.

45:18.360 --> 45:20.400
Write down 478 bricks of cocaine.

45:20.400 --> 45:21.400
Okay.

45:21.400 --> 45:23.680
One brick is clearly missing from the pile.

45:23.680 --> 45:25.600
I think that we can come back to...

45:25.600 --> 45:29.520
Someone must have gotten here before us.

45:29.520 --> 45:30.520
Useful items to have.

45:30.520 --> 45:31.520
I don't know.

45:31.520 --> 45:33.400
An army of homeless people.

45:33.400 --> 45:36.760
If you guys want to do a quick Google search, a brick.

45:36.760 --> 45:44.720
What to do when you find a weapon is worth $25,000, which means an entire palette is

45:44.720 --> 45:48.160
worth roughly $12 million of cocaine.

45:48.160 --> 45:52.680
Guys, I don't know what I'm talking about right now, but what do I do?

45:52.680 --> 45:53.680
Because I'm Thomas.

45:53.680 --> 45:54.680
I'm not.

45:54.680 --> 45:55.680
I think we found a green room.

45:55.680 --> 45:56.680
Maybe.

45:56.680 --> 45:57.680
So I drop...

45:57.680 --> 45:58.680
What are the green boxes?

45:58.680 --> 45:59.680
Yeah.

45:59.680 --> 46:00.680
Cool.

46:00.680 --> 46:01.680
The Gs.

46:01.680 --> 46:02.680
They're in the Gs for green.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.960
This is a pretty poppin' box.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.960
You want to go to the next one?

46:06.960 --> 46:07.960
Yeah.

46:07.960 --> 46:10.600
You guys close this one down.

46:10.600 --> 46:11.600
And lock it back up.

46:11.600 --> 46:12.600
Lock it back up.

46:12.600 --> 46:13.600
I take that.

46:13.600 --> 46:14.600
50 cal.

46:14.600 --> 46:15.600
Ammunition for same.

46:15.600 --> 46:16.880
I pocket some pistols.

46:16.880 --> 46:17.880
Yeah.

46:17.880 --> 46:19.880
Let's load up some guns and stuff in the back of the cruisers.

46:19.880 --> 46:23.880
You guys can drive your two cruisers back there and pile some stuff in there.

46:23.880 --> 46:24.880
Cool.

46:24.880 --> 46:26.920
And I pocket my regular tiny super powerful gun.

46:26.920 --> 46:27.920
Of course you do.

46:27.920 --> 46:28.920
I'll name it later.

46:28.920 --> 46:29.920
Perfect.

46:29.920 --> 46:30.920
What's its name?

46:30.920 --> 46:31.920
I'll name it later.

46:32.160 --> 46:35.040
Oh, that's not a very good name.

46:35.040 --> 46:42.920
Inside G11 is a burlap sack containing $50,000 in shredded blue dye stained banknotes, a

46:42.920 --> 46:48.960
piece of notebook paper with poorly drawn diagrams and nearly illegible writing, two

46:48.960 --> 46:58.600
25 pound bags of potatoes, a ziplock bag containing five bulbs of garlic, a garlic crusher, an

46:58.600 --> 47:07.380
empty test tube, and a syringe, a small drawstring Nike bag, a three million candle power hand

47:07.380 --> 47:15.480
held spotlight, a well filled toolbox, a black leather backpack, a bottle of caffeine pills,

47:15.480 --> 47:21.760
a carton of cigarettes, three shovels, a small digital scale, a syringe labeled morphine,

47:21.760 --> 47:26.640
a handful of ski masks, walkie talkies, and a burned CD.

47:26.640 --> 47:27.640
Could you repeat that?

47:27.680 --> 47:28.960
Inside G11.

47:28.960 --> 47:31.280
What is on the, is the burned CD marked?

47:31.280 --> 47:34.120
It says monster mash mash.

47:34.120 --> 47:35.120
Dope.

47:35.120 --> 47:36.120
Yeah.

47:36.120 --> 47:37.120
Hell yeah.

47:37.120 --> 47:38.120
Okay.

47:38.120 --> 47:44.880
So, real fast, just to throw it out there, Joe, the Delta Green player is super stoked

47:44.880 --> 47:50.120
about having all this stuff, but like we're police officers investigating a missing person.

47:50.120 --> 47:53.240
Like we just, we're just taking all of the shit we find.

47:53.240 --> 47:54.800
That seems a little weird.

47:54.800 --> 48:01.000
I think he would rationalize it that he's seen some fucked up shit last night and he

48:01.000 --> 48:05.640
wants to be prepared for anything and this seems like it's heaven sent.

48:05.640 --> 48:06.640
I love it.

48:06.640 --> 48:07.640
That's right.

48:07.640 --> 48:08.640
That's right.

48:08.640 --> 48:09.640
This is the Lord's word.

48:09.640 --> 48:13.600
So it looks like we might be dealing with like some bank robbers.

48:13.600 --> 48:15.360
I want to look in the Nike bag.

48:15.360 --> 48:17.000
There's nothing in there.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.520
Is there anything in the leather backpack?

48:18.520 --> 48:24.000
The leather backpack contains a set of lock picks, wire cutters, wire strippers, a crimping

48:24.000 --> 48:27.840
tool, flattened Phillips head screwdrivers, and a lockout tool.

48:27.840 --> 48:28.840
Cool.

48:28.840 --> 48:29.840
Grab that bad boy.

48:29.840 --> 48:30.840
I mean, grab everything.

48:30.840 --> 48:32.840
There's morphine that could keep us going.

48:32.840 --> 48:36.800
We go out and call Drew and ask him to send a U-Haul down here.

48:36.800 --> 48:38.880
Do you want to do that?

48:38.880 --> 48:39.880
Yeah.

48:39.880 --> 48:40.880
Kind of, yeah.

48:40.880 --> 48:41.880
Yeah, let's do that.

48:41.880 --> 48:42.880
Well, actually, we have the key.

48:42.880 --> 48:43.960
Logistically, we have the keys.

48:43.960 --> 48:45.120
This shit is all here.

48:45.120 --> 48:46.120
This could be our base of operations.

48:46.120 --> 48:47.120
That's true.

48:47.120 --> 48:48.120
Usually as a safe house for ourselves.

48:48.120 --> 48:51.200
But what if they have an extra set of keys?

48:51.200 --> 48:52.200
Let's get out of here.

48:52.200 --> 48:53.200
Let's get this stuff.

48:53.200 --> 48:54.280
Let's U-Haul it out.

48:54.280 --> 48:55.580
People might try to take it.

48:55.580 --> 48:57.880
Just anybody might come in here and try to take it.

48:57.880 --> 48:59.320
We're confiscating it for evidence.

48:59.320 --> 49:00.320
Yeah, exactly.

49:00.320 --> 49:04.440
We can put it in the evidence room, which is probably pretty sound.

49:04.440 --> 49:05.440
You do have an evidence room.

49:05.440 --> 49:06.440
Yeah.

49:06.440 --> 49:07.440
We'll put it in there.

49:07.440 --> 49:08.440
Let's open.

49:08.440 --> 49:09.440
Yeah.

49:09.440 --> 49:10.440
What's behind door number three?

49:10.440 --> 49:14.800
A trip to France.

49:14.800 --> 49:22.240
Inside G12 is a four-wheeler with dried dirt and clay caked all over the thing, as well

49:22.280 --> 49:26.400
as a couple of plastic trunks.

49:26.400 --> 49:31.560
Near the door is a small chunk of paper that has been folded into the size of a business

49:31.560 --> 49:36.820
card, and against the back wall is a small table with some papers on it.

49:36.820 --> 49:38.320
Was there a paper in G11, too?

49:38.320 --> 49:39.320
No.

49:39.320 --> 49:40.320
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:40.320 --> 49:41.320
Sorry.

49:41.320 --> 49:42.320
There was a piece of notebook paper.

49:42.320 --> 49:43.320
With the scribbles, yeah.

49:43.320 --> 49:45.360
Poorly drawn diagrams and nearly illegible writing.

49:45.360 --> 49:47.000
Do any of you guys have heavy machinery?

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
No.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
Don't think I have any repair shit.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Yeah, I don't see any repair.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
Okay.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.080
I want to find someone who would know more about that.

49:53.080 --> 49:55.480
I want to look at the small chunk of paper first.

49:55.480 --> 50:01.400
The small chunk of paper, as you unfold it, there are some ripped up bedding stubs inside

50:01.400 --> 50:02.880
of it that fall out.

50:02.880 --> 50:09.720
The piece of paper is on a thicker cardstock, and looking at it, you can tell that this

50:09.720 --> 50:15.720
is the translator paper on which people place their bets to see what they're betting on.

50:15.720 --> 50:21.960
So it's got the odds, and each number from the bedding stubs is in relation to a name

50:21.960 --> 50:27.000
on the bedding paper, and it's got a date at the top, and it says October 31st.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
What are the names?

50:28.000 --> 50:33.440
There were three things that you could bet on on October 31st.

50:33.440 --> 50:35.800
Hold on.

50:35.800 --> 50:37.560
Did you like that dick I drew, Zach?

50:37.560 --> 50:39.360
I did like that dick you drew, Thomas.

50:39.360 --> 50:40.760
You drew the stinky foot?

50:40.760 --> 50:41.760
Did you do better?

50:41.760 --> 50:43.080
Oh, the stick's a real stinky foot.

50:43.080 --> 50:44.080
It's a stinky foot.

50:44.080 --> 50:45.080
Did you like that dick I drew?

50:45.080 --> 50:46.080
Did you like that dick I drew?

50:46.080 --> 50:47.080
That dick you drew?

50:47.080 --> 50:48.080
That.

50:48.080 --> 50:49.080
Wowee!

50:49.080 --> 50:58.480
Every time you drew that dick you drew.

50:58.480 --> 51:08.440
The three names are Oz, Mayhem, Wolf, Miles, Detonator, Carver, and Carl Blitzkrieg Anderson.

51:08.440 --> 51:10.880
Are any of us familiar with those names?

51:10.880 --> 51:11.880
Is this like MMA?

51:11.880 --> 51:12.880
Do we even?

51:12.880 --> 51:13.880
We got no.

51:13.880 --> 51:14.880
It sounds like boxers.

51:14.880 --> 51:16.160
Carl Blitzkrieg Anderson.

51:16.160 --> 51:21.120
At the bottom it said versus Planet Juggernaut.

51:21.120 --> 51:26.960
Is there any way that John Lee Pennymore doesn't know about a place called Planet Juggernaut?

51:26.960 --> 51:28.600
It was versus tonight.

51:28.600 --> 51:31.680
Oh, Planet Juggernaut is- Something these three things are versing,

51:31.680 --> 51:32.680
I think.

51:32.680 --> 51:33.680
Oh, God.

51:33.680 --> 51:34.680
So cool.

51:34.680 --> 51:35.680
Super cool.

51:35.680 --> 51:42.600
The ripped up bedding stubs, you can tell he lost, lost, lost, and over the night lost

51:42.600 --> 51:44.480
$5,000.

51:44.480 --> 51:51.040
The last fight he bet on something with like 30 to one odds.

51:51.040 --> 51:52.680
They were all- Not smart.

51:52.680 --> 51:54.200
And they were all kind of bad odds?

51:54.200 --> 51:55.200
Yeah.

51:55.200 --> 52:01.320
The first two were probably closer to five to one, six to one, and then the last one

52:01.320 --> 52:02.320
was 30 to one.

52:02.320 --> 52:04.640
So he gets like desperate after losing that money?

52:04.640 --> 52:05.640
Exactly.

52:05.640 --> 52:09.760
Does a Google search for any of those names turn up information on the participants or

52:09.760 --> 52:10.760
the sport?

52:10.760 --> 52:11.760
Oh, yeah.

52:11.920 --> 52:13.640
Give me the name of one of those fighters.

52:13.640 --> 52:15.080
Oz Mayhem Wolf.

52:15.080 --> 52:16.080
Yeah.

52:16.080 --> 52:24.080
So Oz Mayhem Wolf, it will come up that he has been in like low time MMA fights or amateur

52:24.080 --> 52:27.360
cage boxing or cage fighting, whatever that sport's called.

52:27.360 --> 52:31.080
It's professional fighters, but in cages built by amateurs.

52:31.080 --> 52:32.080
Nice.

52:32.080 --> 52:38.000
So it's just like, there's a risk that it's really shoddy.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Yeah.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
No joke.

52:40.880 --> 52:44.480
What's in the plastic trunks?

52:44.480 --> 52:49.720
Inside one of the trunks is a box of assorted batteries, spools of electric wiring, three

52:49.720 --> 52:56.320
disassembled handguns, and an impossibly clean machete sitting atop three full suits, including

52:56.320 --> 53:02.120
shirt, tie, and shoes, all covered in dirt, clay, and black stains that look to be blood.

53:02.120 --> 53:06.120
Do we need to take a sanity check for seeing an impossibly clean machete?

53:06.120 --> 53:07.120
Luke.

53:07.120 --> 53:08.120
Yes.

53:08.720 --> 53:09.720
Luke.

53:09.720 --> 53:10.720
Yes.

53:10.720 --> 53:15.240
As you approach the other plastic trunk, this one has the lid fastened.

53:15.240 --> 53:18.360
The stench is nearly unbearable.

53:18.360 --> 53:20.400
The trunk is clear and without-

53:20.400 --> 53:23.200
I bet there's a hundred homeless people on this truck.

53:27.760 --> 53:33.760
Without opening the lid, you can see only a dried black crust, which is painted on every

53:33.760 --> 53:36.760
bit of the trunk's insides.

53:36.880 --> 53:42.440
I'll investigate this one back at the lab.

53:42.440 --> 53:46.480
I'm not going to open it in here right now, but let's go see what those papers-

53:46.480 --> 53:47.960
Yeah, take a look at the table.

53:47.960 --> 53:48.960
Okay.

53:48.960 --> 53:55.120
You guys walk back and there is a note handwritten on a piece of paper.

53:55.120 --> 53:57.000
What's that say, John?

53:57.000 --> 53:58.200
The cabin is in the woods.

53:58.200 --> 53:59.200
Love that movie.

53:59.200 --> 54:01.920
Stark West from the end of the trail about two and a half miles.

54:01.920 --> 54:02.920
K.

54:02.920 --> 54:05.800
We took care of nine of them as well as the leader.

54:05.840 --> 54:06.840
Okay.

54:06.840 --> 54:12.160
And there is also a sheet that seems to be ripped out of a notebook.

54:12.160 --> 54:14.880
This one is also handwritten in different handwriting.

54:14.880 --> 54:21.800
It says, the work is difficult and particular, but I've had 12 successes.

54:21.800 --> 54:24.840
Life isn't as complex as they believe.

54:24.840 --> 54:25.840
They are quite simple.

54:25.840 --> 54:27.680
It will be their downfall.

54:27.680 --> 54:32.160
And the last is, it's a cutout from an old newspaper.

54:32.160 --> 54:35.240
Cole's Orphanage, new school under modern etiquette.

54:35.240 --> 54:38.480
We are here to serve the beautiful community of contention.

54:38.480 --> 54:42.280
Is Cole ... Do you remember Cole's Orphanage?

54:42.280 --> 54:43.440
I don't ... That doesn't ring a bell.

54:43.440 --> 54:44.440
The only thing I can think about-

54:44.440 --> 54:49.240
Didn't we used to go to school with hundreds of smelly orphans?

54:49.240 --> 54:52.680
Well, this probably doesn't mean anything.

54:52.680 --> 54:55.200
Let's crumble a month down the way.

54:55.200 --> 54:56.520
Cole's Orphanage.

54:56.520 --> 54:58.600
Cole was the counterpart to beans, right?

54:58.600 --> 54:59.600
Yeah.

54:59.600 --> 55:00.600
Silas Cole, right?

55:00.600 --> 55:01.600
Oh, yeah.

55:01.600 --> 55:02.600
Yep.

55:02.600 --> 55:03.600
Okay.

55:03.600 --> 55:06.280
I'm going to ask some old-timers around here and see if they remember that.

55:06.280 --> 55:12.600
Silas Cole is still known as being one of the founders of this town.

55:12.600 --> 55:17.000
He was the owner of the mine for a couple of years.

55:17.000 --> 55:25.000
And his wife, Mary Cole, did a lot of good in the community, and the library is named

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
after her.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.780
It's the Mary Cole Library.

55:27.780 --> 55:32.720
So one could assume that someone opening this orphanage probably named it after her.

55:32.720 --> 55:36.240
Is there any sign on the clipping of the newspaper what newspaper it came from?

55:36.240 --> 55:37.840
The Contention Chronicle.

55:37.840 --> 55:41.580
But I don't remember a Cole's Orphanage, because I am 37.

55:41.580 --> 55:43.560
It must have opened and closed real quick, right?

55:43.560 --> 55:47.640
Yeah, we should keep this on our radar and try to ask Drew to find out some stuff about

55:47.640 --> 55:48.640
it.

55:48.640 --> 55:49.640
Cool.

55:49.640 --> 55:50.640
Is U-Haul here yet?

55:50.640 --> 55:51.640
Yes.

55:51.640 --> 55:52.640
Do you want to load literally everything?

55:52.640 --> 55:53.640
Yeah.

55:53.640 --> 55:54.640
Mm-hmm.

55:54.640 --> 55:56.600
I also want to ride out of here on that four-wheeler.

55:56.600 --> 55:57.600
Does a four-wheeler run?

55:57.600 --> 55:58.600
Can you drive my cruiser?

55:58.600 --> 55:59.600
Are there keys to the four-wheeler?

55:59.600 --> 56:00.600
Yes.

56:00.600 --> 56:01.600
Cool.

56:01.600 --> 56:02.600
Are you actually going to ride it out?

56:03.480 --> 56:04.480
Yeah.

56:04.480 --> 56:05.480
Okay.

56:05.480 --> 56:06.480
I'll drive your cruiser back then.

56:06.480 --> 56:10.400
I take my shirt off and I get on the four-wheeler.

56:10.400 --> 56:17.000
Just John and some a little bit too tight britches hopping on this four-wheeler without

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
a shirt on.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.520
Is this like the three bears pants situation?

56:20.520 --> 56:22.720
The farts are just right.

56:22.720 --> 56:27.360
What should we do?

56:27.360 --> 56:32.280
I think take it all back to the evidence room and sort it out into different categories

56:32.960 --> 56:33.960
Catalog it all?

56:33.960 --> 56:37.480
Yeah, catalog it all and then try to do some investigating on the stuff that doesn't make

56:37.480 --> 56:38.480
sense to us.

56:38.480 --> 56:40.320
Well, man, there's just so much crime all of a sudden.

56:40.320 --> 56:43.480
Why does it fall to us to deal with that?

56:43.480 --> 56:49.040
Quick cut to the sick montage of you guys loading everything into the evidence room.

56:49.040 --> 56:54.920
Like spraying each other with bullets.

56:54.920 --> 56:55.920
Roll firearms.

56:55.920 --> 56:56.920
Throw encasings.

56:56.920 --> 56:57.920
Throw it, yeah, exactly.

56:58.560 --> 57:02.120
I get tired so I do a quick bump and I'm like, ready to go?

57:02.120 --> 57:03.120
Oh yeah.

57:03.120 --> 57:07.240
I meant to ask you, are you doing any of that cocaine?

57:07.240 --> 57:08.760
I'm not right now.

57:08.760 --> 57:10.600
I'm not doing it right now, but yes.

57:10.600 --> 57:12.480
Keith has been known to dabble.

57:12.480 --> 57:13.480
Yeah.

57:13.480 --> 57:14.480
Clark is a straightener.

57:14.480 --> 57:15.480
Under Clark's eye.

57:15.480 --> 57:16.480
I'm adjusting.

57:16.480 --> 57:21.440
John is taking this to the family reunion and selling it.

57:21.440 --> 57:22.440
I'm not doing it with Clark next to me.

57:22.440 --> 57:26.840
Do you think a contention cop makes a fucking lot of money?

57:26.840 --> 57:27.840
No.

57:28.760 --> 57:29.760
He does not.

57:29.760 --> 57:30.760
Okay, so can we cut to...

57:30.760 --> 57:31.760
It's all catalogued.

57:31.760 --> 57:32.760
Yeah.

57:32.760 --> 57:33.760
Absolutely.

57:33.760 --> 57:34.760
Cool.

57:34.760 --> 57:35.760
Wow, guys, we really put our heads together and made that happen.

57:35.760 --> 57:37.360
You guys really worked through the day too.

57:37.360 --> 57:39.680
You skipped lunch and now it's done at 2 p.m.

57:39.680 --> 57:40.680
How nice.

57:40.680 --> 57:44.280
In the process of cataloguing stuff, did anything new catch our eyes?

57:44.280 --> 57:48.480
Because that's the time when anything would have crossed our vision in particular.

57:48.480 --> 57:50.320
I mean, did you want to look into anything?

57:50.320 --> 57:53.320
I gave you basically the outline of what each thing is.

57:53.320 --> 57:58.200
I want to get Drew to get info on Cole's orphanage and then also see if he can find

57:58.200 --> 58:00.600
anybody that knows about those diagrams that we saw.

58:00.600 --> 58:01.600
Okay, cool.

58:01.600 --> 58:02.600
Very good.

58:02.600 --> 58:04.080
Do we want to do anything with the crusty tub?

58:04.080 --> 58:05.080
Oh, yeah.

58:05.080 --> 58:06.080
Now that we're back...

58:06.080 --> 58:07.080
Yeah, we need to check it out.

58:07.080 --> 58:08.080
I want to...

58:08.080 --> 58:11.560
I mean, maybe it's gore, but it might also be...

58:11.560 --> 58:13.480
Somebody might have isolated some of the black stuff.

58:13.480 --> 58:16.760
Should we do that in the evidence room or should we go outside or...

58:16.760 --> 58:17.760
I don't know.

58:17.760 --> 58:18.760
I'm kind of nervous about it.

58:18.760 --> 58:19.880
Clark is kind of nervous about it.

58:19.880 --> 58:22.880
I'm nervous about it too because this is shit that Keith has seen.

58:22.880 --> 58:26.960
Those lockers were full of weaponry, so if this is some kind of weapon...

58:26.960 --> 58:29.960
Man, I hope nobody comes looking for us.

58:29.960 --> 58:30.960
How about this?

58:30.960 --> 58:31.960
Because we ticked our fangs.

58:31.960 --> 58:32.960
I'll go into...

58:32.960 --> 58:33.960
I assume...

58:33.960 --> 58:35.560
Do we have like a jail cell?

58:35.560 --> 58:36.560
Yeah.

58:36.560 --> 58:38.960
I want to go into one of those with this tub and open it up.

58:38.960 --> 58:40.440
You're taking that upon yourself, Keith?

58:40.440 --> 58:43.000
I've got one leg and I'm doing it.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.440
I'm interested too.

58:44.440 --> 58:51.080
The rancid smell of old metal hits your nostrils and atop this pile of what looks like a messily

58:51.080 --> 58:56.360
chopped up human body sits a woman's head split down the middle and pulled apart with

58:56.360 --> 59:00.480
a small silver sphere sitting in between the two halves.

59:00.480 --> 59:01.480
Well, this could be anything.

59:01.480 --> 59:02.480
Hell yeah.

59:02.480 --> 59:03.480
Real sanity?

59:03.480 --> 59:04.480
Pass.

59:04.480 --> 59:05.480
I passed.

59:05.480 --> 59:07.280
I passed.

59:07.280 --> 59:08.960
You all wear old hands.

59:08.960 --> 59:10.960
I crit pass if that helps me in any way.

59:10.960 --> 59:11.960
Oh, yeah, it does.

59:11.960 --> 59:12.960
How about you don't look?

59:12.960 --> 59:13.960
Okay.

59:13.960 --> 59:14.960
Yeah.

59:14.960 --> 59:15.960
Does that work for you?

59:15.960 --> 59:16.960
For sure.

59:16.960 --> 59:19.680
Keith and John, you both lose one sanity on a pass.

59:19.680 --> 59:21.040
Are you going to put the lid back on?

59:21.040 --> 59:22.040
Oh, yeah, I am.

59:22.040 --> 59:23.040
Okay.

59:23.040 --> 59:24.040
Actually, wait.

59:24.040 --> 59:29.120
I'm going to like snap for evidence, snap a picture of this and see can we identify?

59:29.120 --> 59:30.120
Identifiable.

59:30.120 --> 59:31.120
Yeah.

59:31.120 --> 59:35.080
The only thing that's really, I mean, it is cleaved into.

59:35.080 --> 59:36.080
Yes.

59:36.080 --> 59:38.200
Cleft in twain.

59:38.200 --> 59:39.200
If you will.

59:39.200 --> 59:41.080
Clove in twove.

59:41.080 --> 59:43.240
It's cloved in twoved.

59:43.240 --> 59:44.680
And if you put the halves together.

59:44.680 --> 59:46.720
If you smash them together.

59:46.760 --> 59:52.360
It's like trying to make a face.

59:52.360 --> 59:58.520
So it's, you say it's identifiable, but we can't, I mean, we recognize this person?

59:58.520 --> 59:59.520
No.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.160
But it's identifiable to someone that would have known this person.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.600
Like did you mean it's recognizably a person?

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.080
It's recognizably a woman's head.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.800
But like, it's not really, it's so old.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.800
This has been.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.800
Well, that's, how about this?

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.360
I'm going to take a picture of it, take a picture of it, close it back up and send this

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.200
box to the corner.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.200
Let him deal with it.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:24.400
Before we do that, I want to take a look at the little silver ball in the skull.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.400
Do you want to grab it?

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400
Yeah.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.400
Let's grab it.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.400
Okay.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.400
You grab it.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.880
Look, it's a little silver sphere.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.140
About how big?

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:34.560
About the size of a large marble.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:39.840
And by large marble, I mean it's one inch in diameter.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.840
So the radius is a half inch.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.880
I hold onto it for good luck.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.880
What's the circumference?

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:45.880
Awesome.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.880
Oh shit.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.960
I don't know that good a man.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.560
Should we send this to the corner just to see if we can get anything out of it?

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.400
It didn't like attack and kill us, so I assume.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.560
Why would you assume a dead body would do that?

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.520
I've seen some fucked up shit today and yesterday.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.520
Like what?

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:32.160
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
