00:00.000 --> 00:04.680
Greetings my baby chickens. It's your mother hen wolf the dog

00:05.080 --> 00:12.120
And I'm here to nest upon all of the eggs of contention hatching them into my own personal chicken army

00:12.120 --> 00:14.280
I'm clucking at you live from

00:15.280 --> 00:19.600
694.2 PTBP as always my chickadees

00:20.200 --> 00:28.000
Real quick before we get up and started the boys from pretended to be people wanted me to let you know they are accepting

00:28.320 --> 00:30.320
Questions for a third Q&A

00:30.920 --> 00:38.840
Episode so if you have questions for any of the monsters that make that show tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram

00:39.680 --> 00:46.960
There will also be a post in the subreddit where you can comment your questions or post them on our Facebook page

00:47.520 --> 00:52.920
Fuck you mark fucker burg or email them to pretending pod at gmail.com

00:53.480 --> 01:00.140
Or and seriously y'all should go do this go all out record audio of you asking your questions

01:00.520 --> 01:06.320
And send that so they can use it in the episode much like the second Q&A episode

01:06.320 --> 01:13.920
This one will be for our honorary police officers over on patreon who keep this show alive five bucks a month at a time

01:14.680 --> 01:18.160
Speaking of things my producer forces me to read each week

01:18.200 --> 01:20.440
We got a new howling at wolf for y'all

01:20.880 --> 01:28.060
This week's is from at mad under dash seed who tweeted about the show and tagged at pretending pod

01:28.120 --> 01:35.060
It reads as follows if you're not sure what kind of officer you're dealing with from contention PD

01:35.160 --> 01:41.340
Just check the fit of the pants and listen to pretending to be people for one of the best actual play

01:41.540 --> 01:47.420
Podcast out there love the podcast and wish there was a higher donor tear smiles

01:48.020 --> 01:52.300
Madeline man, I miss seeing those officers in the future

01:52.300 --> 01:59.020
You would think an entity could never truly miss a despicable being such as Keith Vigna and you'd be right

01:59.140 --> 02:00.620
Don't worry Madeline

02:00.620 --> 02:06.980
There may be more questionable content for you to throw even more of your hard-earned money at in the future

02:07.700 --> 02:13.700
Sometimes when looking forward it is important to glance behind and remind your mind that

02:13.980 --> 02:17.860
Mankind is designed inclined and resigned to die

02:18.420 --> 02:20.220
It's time for the news

02:20.220 --> 02:22.900
Last time Ken Krenkelhoff Liz

02:23.180 --> 02:28.180
Longlin and Jeremy Pettymore came across a large frame hanging in the woods

02:28.540 --> 02:36.060
Can realized an old memory was closer to reality than he had hoped but he was able to disable a trap that otherwise

02:36.340 --> 02:44.260
would have put a giant wooden spear through someone's mouth and out the back of the head through the broken canvas in the frame the

02:44.260 --> 02:47.020
three see a cabin in the woods Ken

02:47.620 --> 02:49.620
susceptible to being scared of cliches

02:49.940 --> 02:56.200
Freaked out grabbed the spear and charged toward the cabin and then he disappeared into a pile of leaves

02:56.780 --> 03:00.420
Ash hornbeam was down on hope and hit points

03:00.420 --> 03:05.500
But a man in a black suit with a bolo tie came out of nowhere to interrogate him

03:05.740 --> 03:13.120
After agent Kevin got the information ash had to think quickly in order to not become just another missing person in the woods

03:13.780 --> 03:20.220
Thankfully his quick wit and false reputation was enough to convince agent Kevin to spare him for now

03:20.660 --> 03:24.040
Now this next sentence may sound a bit kooky

03:24.040 --> 03:32.100
But agent Kevin came back with a woman named agent Karen who chanted over a machete and then in one swift motion

03:32.460 --> 03:35.580
Took off ashes arm in the middle of his forearm

03:36.540 --> 03:41.340
Stranger still the wound immediately cauterized and flesh grew to form a nub

03:41.620 --> 03:48.080
They took ash to a black car hidden in thick brush where they are set up to stake out a cabin in the woods

03:49.200 --> 03:53.420
Sharon shadow Berryman somewhere between unaware and

03:53.780 --> 04:01.500
Purposefully oblivious followed Krista Kringlehoff off the path into the darkness and directly into a skip bow trap

04:01.580 --> 04:07.580
Right around the ankle it then became clear that perhaps Krista Kringlehoff isn't quite herself

04:08.420 --> 04:12.740
Judy Kringlehoff having seen the body of the state ranger ed buzz

04:13.100 --> 04:18.320
Woodrow all spineless and shit walked back out into the darkness the rain

04:18.620 --> 04:24.020
The parking lot of the contention woods and then she made a terrible decision

04:24.020 --> 04:30.020
Taking us from here in the warm glow and comfort of Wolf's secret hideout

04:30.020 --> 04:35.020
That is definitely not a trash can to that moment in the shivering wet

04:35.340 --> 04:40.940
Darkness lit only by strikes of lightning in the distance. It's blue false

04:41.420 --> 04:43.420
indigo with

04:54.020 --> 04:56.020
Oh

05:20.940 --> 05:22.940
Time has come

05:24.020 --> 05:26.020
to

05:26.660 --> 05:32.900
Dance beneath a dance beneath the shadow of the moon

05:54.060 --> 06:00.180
a lightning bolt flashes in the distance and it's just enough to light up a

06:01.500 --> 06:03.300
blood-covered

06:03.300 --> 06:05.300
Krista Kringlehoff

06:06.100 --> 06:08.100
Who is walking?

06:09.740 --> 06:11.740
Directly toward you

06:12.580 --> 06:14.580
The raccoon at your side

06:16.180 --> 06:19.420
Shivers something fierce and is like

06:19.420 --> 06:21.420
Right

06:22.420 --> 06:29.580
Tugs at your arm and then just fucking takes off running backwards like back towards no like crab walking. Yeah. No it runs

06:31.140 --> 06:37.060
Like into the parking lot trying to get to the street, okay, but not running back towards the shack hell no

06:37.060 --> 06:42.140
Okay, running as far away from these woods here as possible. Okay, I don't follow him

06:42.140 --> 06:44.700
I state I stay there cuz I'm first of all

06:45.100 --> 06:50.380
Freaking out from the body and I am not sure what to think of my mom. So I I stand there Judy

06:51.460 --> 06:52.940
Judy Judy

06:52.940 --> 06:56.980
That girl that girl that you were with is she is no good

06:57.220 --> 07:00.260
She was not trying to help look for Liz at all

07:00.260 --> 07:05.940
in fact, she she told me she told me that she wanted to just run back to the woods with her and

07:06.620 --> 07:08.620
And and told me to come back out here

07:14.700 --> 07:16.700
I'm so scared for you

07:16.740 --> 07:22.540
Maybe we should go back up to the shack and I'll see if I can find some band-aids in your purse to help fix

07:22.540 --> 07:29.020
You up that is an excellent idea. Thank you so much. Okay, so I guide her back up to the shack

07:29.020 --> 07:33.800
I'm like holding on to her and helping her walk and then as soon as we get to the shack

07:33.800 --> 07:37.460
I want to get her in the shack and close the door you do so

07:37.460 --> 07:43.260
Okay, and then I can't find a lock or anything. So at this point I just close the door and I'm just holding it

07:43.400 --> 07:49.180
Okay, well my mother is inside. Yeah, absolutely and as you're holding the door. Oh

07:52.660 --> 07:54.660
Shit

07:54.740 --> 07:59.020
You feel a pinch on the back of your neck and

08:00.340 --> 08:04.860
when you turn around you see that your

08:05.380 --> 08:09.860
mom's body has crumpled to the ground and

08:10.620 --> 08:18.740
Standing in front of you its metallic arms shoved into the ground and the ceiling and the walls of the shack in

08:18.900 --> 08:24.460
The middle of which is a small one inch in diameter metal sphere

08:24.980 --> 08:27.740
One of these tendrils reaches around

08:28.340 --> 08:33.140
with another tendril it snaps Judy Krenkelhoff's neck forward and

08:33.780 --> 08:35.780
rips out her spine

08:36.300 --> 08:37.980
shoving itself

08:37.980 --> 08:41.700
Into the spinal column and filling it and

08:42.500 --> 08:47.300
You Allie are now playing this entity

08:51.020 --> 08:57.260
Okay in which you remember all of these strange memories

08:57.780 --> 09:01.980
All of these details, but you are an objective based

09:02.540 --> 09:06.100
Entity and your objective is to collect as many

09:06.860 --> 09:08.860
Bodies as possible

09:09.020 --> 09:16.860
So your goal Allie is to get one-on-one with one of the other players and pass off this entity

09:17.060 --> 09:23.500
That way it can collect more bodies. Okay, and you will also know what has recently happened

09:23.500 --> 09:27.500
So, you know that you came to the woods as Judy Krenkelhoff

09:27.940 --> 09:34.980
With shadow and Liz and you know that you were out there to do a spell or a ritual

09:34.980 --> 09:41.300
But that is all the information from Judy Krenkelhoff that you know, everything else will just have to be

09:42.180 --> 09:44.180
hog shit and horse lies

09:48.540 --> 09:50.540
Makes improv easier. I

09:51.660 --> 09:57.520
Told my parents about this podcast. My dad was like, so you just lie quick

09:58.780 --> 10:01.300
It's like yep. He's like you're gonna be good at that

10:04.980 --> 10:06.980
Life

10:22.980 --> 10:27.980
Do we know any of the other words to that song cuz I don't yeah, I think it's a lot of bad

10:27.980 --> 10:31.180
I think it's a lot of bus. What if it was just that the whole time?

10:31.820 --> 10:33.260
Alright, Joe

10:33.260 --> 10:37.060
You're sliding on your back and you can feel the

10:37.580 --> 10:42.380
Mud and sludge is making this slide a bit more

10:43.060 --> 10:50.300
Liquid and thick viscous. However still enough to slide you down and you are sliding for some time

10:50.940 --> 10:52.940
before you land

10:53.580 --> 10:59.300
Eventually in a pit of dirt and pitch blackness. Can I get a sense of how much lateral movement I had

10:59.300 --> 11:05.780
So much lateral movement, so I'm like underground yeah, you might think that with all that lateral movement you've slid

11:06.620 --> 11:08.620
underneath this cabin

11:09.580 --> 11:17.380
That far perfect fuck you are on your back scared out of your gourd because it's spooky time. Everything's a

11:19.500 --> 11:22.280
And you you're scared out of your coconut this Halloween

11:23.280 --> 11:25.280
Oh

11:26.280 --> 11:29.680
Patreon listeners will remember our episode in Hawaii

11:31.520 --> 11:38.440
Coconuts were the gourds of that game. All right, so you feel dirt and rock

11:38.760 --> 11:46.120
Underneath your hands. I want to try and stand up. Can I almost all the way before your head hits a piece of wood? Oh

11:46.880 --> 11:52.080
Shit, it's wood. Can I look up back? What if I had said stone? I know I wasn't sure

11:53.280 --> 11:57.560
Can I look back up the slide? I just came down. Can I see any daylight or I mean moonlight?

11:57.560 --> 12:03.440
There's no daylight or moonlight coming down from where you came from. You know, it kind of would have been cool

12:03.440 --> 12:05.440
If it had been daylight

12:07.800 --> 12:11.040
You can tell it's the Sun making this light it's a different color

12:11.520 --> 12:16.840
Is there any light in this area that I know you are in perfect Vin Diesel darkness?

12:16.840 --> 12:18.840
Did I hang on to my spear on my way through? Oh

12:19.680 --> 12:21.680
Go ahead and roll

12:21.880 --> 12:23.080
dexterity

12:23.080 --> 12:24.760
Okay

12:24.760 --> 12:28.000
Can crinkle Hoff so good at sport? I'm a sport sports boy

12:28.600 --> 12:30.040
32 on a

12:30.040 --> 12:34.760
75 so good at holding on to his giant spear and it is

12:35.960 --> 12:42.800
Horizontal with where you are. It would not be able to stand up as you remember it being longer than you

12:42.800 --> 12:46.080
Can I okay, you know how long you are as a human?

12:46.080 --> 12:48.080
If

12:48.360 --> 12:53.620
I look up I've deduced that I'm maybe under the cabin. Is it floorboards above me?

12:53.620 --> 12:59.120
Is it maybe slats of wood? It's not no because there's no light coming down this I said it was yeah

12:59.200 --> 13:02.520
So therefore there's no slats of wood of you

13:02.520 --> 13:09.540
Can I want to just lightly push and see if it maybe is hopefully a door that I'm under you do not seem to be

13:09.540 --> 13:11.160
under a door

13:11.160 --> 13:14.640
Do you have anything on you that could make a light of any kind

13:14.880 --> 13:19.520
Yeah, he doesn't have a lighter because he's such a good boy. I mean I was out camping

13:19.520 --> 13:23.840
Maybe I have a flashlight on me. Is there a role to determine if I had a flashlight on me? Yeah, absolutely

13:24.520 --> 13:30.460
Let's just roll an up and down 50% look if you roll under you succeed if you roll over you fail

13:32.280 --> 13:36.280
They're rolled over oh, but it's a 69 our house rule makes that a

13:36.280 --> 13:38.280
You

13:40.480 --> 13:45.600
Have whatever light source you want one of those ones that lights it up like daylight

13:47.000 --> 13:49.380
It'll burn the wood. It's so bright. I

13:50.920 --> 13:54.040
Just got a nice big mag light. Yeah, you absolutely do

13:54.040 --> 13:59.040
I flipped that bad boy on when you flip it on you see that you are in the crawl space

13:59.640 --> 14:03.740
But this doesn't seem like a place that is often used

14:04.420 --> 14:08.660
However, you do see what looks like maybe floor supports

14:09.060 --> 14:14.500
However, they are tube like in nature and as you flash the flashlight

14:15.020 --> 14:18.360
Over them you see that they are

14:18.980 --> 14:22.220
translucent tubes that are filled

14:22.900 --> 14:29.300
With this squeamish black ooze that seems to be traveling downward

14:29.980 --> 14:32.600
from above into the ground below

14:34.300 --> 14:37.100
My god Zach, you're the coolest

14:41.820 --> 14:46.740
You also see on the far side away from you there's a door that leads up

14:46.740 --> 14:52.060
I mean, I think Ken would for sure maybe try back the slidey way

14:52.060 --> 14:56.680
Can he get any purchase to get back up the slide that he came down? Oh interesting

14:56.680 --> 15:00.100
I don't think he would want to be going into the house if he could help it. Yeah, that makes sense

15:00.820 --> 15:03.300
Go ahead and give it a go with an

15:03.980 --> 15:08.700
Athletics check are you bringing the spear or no? Yeah, that's not gonna leave my side

15:08.700 --> 15:12.620
Okay, if at all possible go ahead and take a negative 20 on the athletics check

15:15.460 --> 15:17.180
And it's a fail

15:17.180 --> 15:24.420
70 on what would be a 30 you continue to try and try but there's so much

15:24.460 --> 15:30.500
Sludge in this area that it's like the Japanese game show slippery stairs. That's what I was picturing and

15:31.340 --> 15:34.240
You're not green. Dang. Yeah should have bet on blue

15:36.480 --> 15:38.480
Okay, then I am going to

15:39.020 --> 15:40.540
cautiously approach the

15:40.540 --> 15:45.420
Cautiously approach the door and I want to put my ear to it. Do I hear any sounds on the other side?

15:45.420 --> 15:47.420
We'll find out after we

15:54.420 --> 15:56.420
You

16:09.020 --> 16:10.180
Luke

16:10.180 --> 16:17.840
Ashhorn beam walks to this black sedan and this four-wheeler that are out in the middle of these woods in this thick of brush

16:17.840 --> 16:19.840
of trees and

16:20.380 --> 16:23.160
Agent Kevin looks at you. All right

16:23.960 --> 16:27.640
Get on get on in we're staking up this this cabin

16:27.640 --> 16:33.200
I'll tell you more and and he opens up the back door for you ash kind of hesitantly

16:34.500 --> 16:41.400
He looks at the FBI agents and for one moment he thinks about just taking off

16:41.560 --> 16:46.340
It's raining. It's dark, but he doesn't it takes him about three seconds

16:46.340 --> 16:53.220
Which seems like five minutes and he hops into the back of the car and when you hop into the back of this black

16:53.220 --> 16:59.580
Sedan sitting in the back seat on the other side is a man who is quite tall

16:59.780 --> 17:04.300
it's wearing the same black suit white shirt black tie and

17:05.060 --> 17:10.420
he's blonde but his hair is like buzzed and he's in his early 30s and

17:11.420 --> 17:16.980
He looks at you and immediately flashes you a FBI badge and it's like agent Kyle

17:17.100 --> 17:20.460
Nice to meet you ash looks over at him doesn't say anything

17:20.980 --> 17:25.980
Buckles his seat belt and looks straight at the ground or the floor of the car

17:25.980 --> 17:32.780
I suppose agent Karen gets in the shotgun seat and agent Kevin gets in the driver's seat and

17:33.400 --> 17:39.280
Looking at the floorboards you see that there's a bunch of electrical spool wiring

17:39.480 --> 17:46.440
Yeah, we got some we got some pretty cool explosives in the back man. Yeah, I'm gonna blow this thing the fuck up, right?

17:49.720 --> 17:51.000
I'm sorry

17:51.000 --> 17:54.720
It's gonna be tight man. Ash is super cool. Ash looks at him and

17:55.280 --> 17:57.280
He's immediately intrigued

17:57.480 --> 18:04.600
he starts looking at the spool on the floorboard and he's immediately reminded of

18:05.080 --> 18:08.240
The time that him and his father set up

18:09.080 --> 18:12.240
fireworks display for the town for contention and

18:14.000 --> 18:21.560
Ash gets super excited. He looks at the FBI agent opens up his jacket a little bit to reveal

18:22.200 --> 18:26.520
what I called water dynamite sure and then I

18:27.080 --> 18:35.000
show him the other side of my jacket, which is two sticks of actual dynamite and I

18:35.880 --> 18:37.880
wink and finger gun

18:38.280 --> 18:44.360
Well young sir, that's dino might and hopefully we don't die tonight. I

18:45.480 --> 18:49.520
Look back at the floor and I just kind of pick up the piece of the wire

18:49.800 --> 18:57.380
Like look at him and look at the wire. It's like just smile. What's your name young sir? Um, my name's ash hornbeam

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
And you've always sounded like that

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
So

19:06.440 --> 19:13.840
As you guys ash hornbeam that's that's more like it my name's I ash hornbeam my name's ash hornbeam I

19:14.680 --> 19:16.680
think I kind of

19:17.600 --> 19:22.480
Really steered into this is the way names of that thick southern Malayas

19:22.480 --> 19:25.080
I was trying to do a port of relaxing

19:25.280 --> 19:32.000
As you're looking out ahead of you you see this cabin that's sitting out in this small clearing and

19:32.240 --> 19:38.360
Outside the cabin you see that there is sack is scrolling on his computer

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I'm I'm

19:41.040 --> 19:46.960
Intrigued and worried there seems to be some sort of outdoor building almost like a pod, you know

19:46.960 --> 19:50.120
Like a storage locker kind of unit thing. Yeah

19:50.120 --> 19:57.320
There's one of those and there's also a big yellow excavator sitting outside and you had our pillar

19:57.440 --> 19:59.440
yeah, exactly and

19:59.440 --> 20:06.320
You would also notice that there is a moat that surrounds this cabin

20:06.360 --> 20:11.240
You can't tell how wide it is or how deep it is because you're still pretty far away

20:11.240 --> 20:16.800
But you can see glinting off the surface of this water is the moonlight and that's how you kind of catch that

20:16.800 --> 20:21.040
There's water there and then you see to the left of the cabin

20:22.280 --> 20:27.920
movement outside the moat or yes, yeah about 25 yards out and

20:28.560 --> 20:32.480
You see Liz lonklin is with your two friends

20:33.000 --> 20:37.040
Jeremy Pettymore and Ken Krenkelhoff and they are like

20:37.520 --> 20:44.880
Walking around this kind of thing and then they all stop and they're talking to each other and then Ken picks up this small log

20:44.880 --> 20:51.080
And throws it on the ground and you see this wooden spear seven feet long

20:51.240 --> 20:55.100
Just like flies in their direction and then hits a tree

20:55.680 --> 20:56.520
immediately

20:56.520 --> 20:57.320
Ken

20:57.320 --> 21:04.640
Crabs this giant wooden spear out of the tree and takes off running and as he takes off running

21:04.880 --> 21:10.720
Towards the cabin still like 20 yards away from the moat at this point. He just disappears

21:10.720 --> 21:18.820
He like falls into the ground running away or towards and he falls into the ground and is completely out of sight

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
Dude I'm trying to describe my

21:28.720 --> 21:34.180
What I looked like just then just I could not Luke look like a possum in headlights

21:35.100 --> 21:38.700
Deer in the headlights, but or just a possum a possum in a flashlight

21:38.940 --> 21:44.860
Kevin looks in the rearview mirror and he's like, oh, do you uh, do you know them and he looks back and he's like

21:44.860 --> 21:50.820
We were looking around this place is just chock full of traps. Well, what is this place?

21:50.820 --> 21:56.900
You know that mad you were talking about? Yeah, I don't know if that's her name or if that's her name now, but

21:58.180 --> 21:59.860
Is she?

21:59.860 --> 22:03.740
She's real. Oh, she's real. I always kind of thought

22:04.260 --> 22:07.940
Kind of just a reason to get us out here, but overall sanity for me

22:10.900 --> 22:13.060
The 99 is good, right? Oh

22:15.500 --> 22:20.100
Yes, yes it is Luke it is very good what does that mean

22:20.100 --> 22:25.860
Well, it means you take max damage, which was gonna be a d4 plus one. So you lose five sanity

22:25.860 --> 22:30.300
I don't get to roll my d4. No, you do not you automatically take maximum

22:31.180 --> 22:35.720
Sanity hit. So what was your sanity at? I was at I think 38. Let me see

22:36.300 --> 22:41.940
37 so I'm down to 32 32 and also we're doing bouts of insanity

22:42.340 --> 22:43.820
For this game here

22:43.820 --> 22:48.740
And so when you lose five or more sanity in a single loss

22:49.020 --> 22:56.020
My breaking point is also 32. Well, then that happens to work out fucking perfectly because you're gonna lose your shit. So

22:56.540 --> 22:58.540
You remember in the old?

22:58.700 --> 23:03.220
Campaigns we ran when you lost five or more sanity. We did fight flight or faint, right?

23:03.220 --> 23:07.140
So did we do that on the podcast or was that not yet? Oh, man

23:07.140 --> 23:07.420
All right

23:07.420 --> 23:14.140
So Luke basically you're given the option fight flight or faint you need to rank them and most likely to least likely

23:14.380 --> 23:18.660
Her ashes reaction for ash fight is number one. Sure

23:20.140 --> 23:23.340
Faint is number two flight is the last one

23:23.340 --> 23:27.460
He doesn't run away from anything unless he has to if you roll one two or three

23:27.500 --> 23:32.980
You're gonna fight if you roll a four or five you're gonna faint and if you roll a six you're gonna flight

23:32.980 --> 23:35.340
Am I rolling a d6 d6 for me?

23:35.340 --> 23:40.820
This is the first time I've used the d6 that Joe gave us. Oh nice and heavy

23:40.820 --> 23:46.020
When did Joe give us these he gave you and I those for Thomas's birthday

23:46.580 --> 23:49.180
Which is that is listener

23:50.340 --> 23:56.300
very indicative of Joe Terry is to give lots of people gifts for

23:56.500 --> 24:04.180
Someone's birthday. He's the nicest person. He just knows that you and I are those kids like the kids birthday party

24:04.180 --> 24:10.340
Why did he get presents? I want something too. If Thomas gets a treat

24:10.340 --> 24:16.020
I want it too. I just had terribly vivid memories of La Croix boy. Oh

24:16.660 --> 24:18.660
Jesus we did

24:18.860 --> 24:20.860
We had fun

24:21.340 --> 24:23.340
Roll that d6 formula

24:24.340 --> 24:29.980
What do you think I got I think you got a six I got a six on your slump the slump in your shoulders

24:29.980 --> 24:35.220
Yeah, I got a six. So I think that's a flight. That is a flight. Damn it

24:35.900 --> 24:41.480
That works out really well for me personally. I'm sure I'd leave the room. Yeah, get the fuck out of here. Okay. Bye. Bye

24:53.340 --> 24:55.340
You

24:57.140 --> 25:02.300
Thomas Lindsay who what that's fair Jeremy Pettymore and Liz lonklin are

25:02.700 --> 25:09.260
Standing in the dark of the woods is and you see working a body of Ken Krenkelhoff

25:09.260 --> 25:15.340
What just fucking disappear into the ground ahead of you and it begins to rain

25:15.340 --> 25:20.700
It's like pouring starts light, but you hear in the distance a storm is coming

25:20.700 --> 25:26.460
Oh shit Liz, it sounds like a storms coming. He's gonna drown in that hole. I need you

25:28.260 --> 25:32.140
I need you both through all sanity. I need it

25:36.860 --> 25:38.740
27 on

25:38.740 --> 25:43.220
75 damn he has good sanity. That's like the one good thing of all these characters

25:44.220 --> 25:49.780
So you will not lose any sanity and you're like, yeah, you fell into a hole. He's just playing. Yeah

25:51.300 --> 25:56.860
A 62 on wait, I'm confused. So you've got current and max. Okay. I think it's a 32

25:56.860 --> 26:02.980
Yes, that would make sense and you rolled far above that. So you're gonna just lose one sanity putting your current at 31 and

26:04.100 --> 26:10.520
Liz is gonna start to freak out a little bit. You're out here. You don't know what part of the woods you're in

26:10.620 --> 26:12.620
You've never seen this cabin before

26:13.100 --> 26:15.100
Ken Krenkelhoff

26:15.140 --> 26:22.220
Prominent player in the stylus Cole K through 12 community just disappeared not only into the ground

26:22.220 --> 26:25.140
But also off of your list of suitable bachelors

26:27.380 --> 26:32.140
Wait, you mean you was considering freshman only one

26:36.460 --> 26:38.460
Jeremy falls into a hole

26:38.460 --> 26:40.460
Of

26:40.900 --> 26:42.900
His own making

26:44.420 --> 26:48.900
Okay, so where we are I'm going and see yeah a little bit

26:51.660 --> 26:57.620
Do you guys want to move toward the cabin or move away from the cabin or I want to move towards the hole

26:58.700 --> 27:00.020
Yeah, we saw okay

27:00.020 --> 27:05.980
So moving up to the hole you would see that he slid into like a pile of leaves

27:06.420 --> 27:09.540
That turned into a mudslide pit

27:09.540 --> 27:13.220
It looks like the top of a slide that's made out of sludge that

27:13.460 --> 27:19.420
Disappears at an angle into the ground and then looking forward you see the cabin

27:19.420 --> 27:26.860
It's far more well lit. Now. The lights are on inside so you can see it from you know, the window lights

27:26.860 --> 27:34.720
I suppose however, you can also see in the moonlight that outside there is a storage container seemingly like a small

27:35.560 --> 27:40.040
rectangular box separate from the cabin itself as well as

27:41.440 --> 27:46.920
Big yellow excavator sitting outside the cabin and about

27:47.800 --> 27:52.640
ten yards away from the cabin encircling it is a moat and

27:53.280 --> 27:57.800
The moonlight is reflecting off of the water of this moat

27:57.800 --> 28:03.440
Both of you roll an alertness check for me. Actually, whoever's got a better alertness will count

28:03.560 --> 28:06.160
50 same I rolled a 31 beautiful

28:06.160 --> 28:12.280
We'll use that as you also notice that there are some fish flopping up out of the water

28:12.520 --> 28:17.000
Strange for a moat size size of fish. Do we get to see them? Yeah, what was the size small mouth?

28:17.960 --> 28:18.960
base

28:18.960 --> 28:24.120
base bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb wow wow, you guys know how

28:33.440 --> 28:35.440
Look in the moat

28:49.280 --> 28:52.240
All right, I'm done all right, so you guys are

29:03.680 --> 29:08.800
In the pale fish light wrong freshman and so you guys

29:11.040 --> 29:16.600
It's a popular 90s how the song goes popular 90s song that I wasn't role-playing

29:16.640 --> 29:20.040
I don't give a fuck. So you see that

29:21.480 --> 29:26.740
What do you guys do does anyone want to take the slide or you're gonna approach the cabin this reminds me of that fish song

29:27.360 --> 29:33.080
Not the band fish, but that song about the fish in the moonlight. I don't know. It's weird. What where did Ken go?

29:33.200 --> 29:37.800
What what's going on? I mean, I've told people before but my buddies didn't believe me

29:37.800 --> 29:42.980
But I've I've seen madge in these woods. Do you believe in old mange? What the hell is madge?

29:42.980 --> 29:45.960
Oh man, just the witch that haunts these woods

29:46.920 --> 29:51.080
And I think she might be the witch playing tricks on us tonight. Does she live in that house?

29:51.080 --> 29:53.520
There's only one way to find out let's go

29:53.760 --> 30:00.520
Approaching the moat you see that it is about five feet across to the other side. It's absurdly large moat for

30:01.360 --> 30:03.360
a cabin in the woods

30:03.560 --> 30:07.800
It's useful. Is there is the shed or any other thing on the other side of the moat?

30:07.800 --> 30:10.520
Everything is inside the moat. You want to try to throw me across?

30:13.680 --> 30:20.480
I like that you went to me throwing you and not you throw me throw me Liz Liz is so much smaller boy

30:20.480 --> 30:26.440
Wait, we do we still have the other guy with him? No, he fell down the mud hole. No the other she lost sanity. Oh

30:27.280 --> 30:31.660
Yeah, we were supposed to be finding him but good fucking look

30:36.640 --> 30:42.240
Did you completely forget about your dog man, listen the way Zach is running this we're going in and out of this room

30:42.240 --> 30:44.680
It's been a while. Yeah, we got rusty here

30:46.520 --> 30:48.720
Can we throw rusty rusty

30:48.840 --> 30:53.880
Why don't you make a human rusty is easily six foot three and I want him to make a human bridge

30:54.520 --> 31:00.960
Across this river. Yes do it. I'm gonna throw so I'm gonna scatter some smokies like on the other side

31:02.000 --> 31:07.720
And I like kind of like demonstrate with motions like what I want him to do to share the Smokies hold his feet

31:07.720 --> 31:09.720
Make sure he doesn't jump and yeah pretty much

31:10.240 --> 31:12.080
That's that's actually what I'll just do

31:12.080 --> 31:18.400
I'll just like I'll toss some Smokies to the other like sure and I'll hold his feet as he leaps across for them

31:20.200 --> 31:22.200
Okay, good idea Liz

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Thanks, I

31:25.280 --> 31:28.760
That happens and we eagerly run across his back

31:30.480 --> 31:32.480
Which is Kevin, okay

31:35.680 --> 31:41.560
Eagerly run across his back to a witch's cabin is a little too long for the episode title, but it's

31:42.400 --> 31:49.360
It's close. So I need you whoever has the worst dexterity to roll dexterity. Probably me

31:49.360 --> 31:52.800
I have 25 50. Yeah, Liz lonklin makes it across

31:53.800 --> 31:58.480
Very easily. Oh shit. You better make it. I didn't 63. I

31:59.160 --> 32:01.160
step on his balls

32:01.880 --> 32:08.760
Rusty has his ankles on one shore being held by Jeremy petty more and he reaches out for the

32:09.080 --> 32:14.960
tiny meat fingers on the other side of the moat and he

32:15.200 --> 32:20.680
Grasps onto the ground on the other side and as soon as he makes that bridge connection

32:20.960 --> 32:25.840
you know like when two grandmas become friends Liz lonklin just

32:29.040 --> 32:33.720
Rushes across the body and rusty and Jeremy

32:35.040 --> 32:42.360
following shortly after all people play bridge this is toe stuck right in the crotch of all rusty and

32:43.360 --> 32:45.360
You know when you stub your toe on a taint

32:46.000 --> 32:52.600
Everyone knows that sensation and so you fall and you hit rusty and you both fall into the moat

32:52.600 --> 32:54.600
Well, I didn't put any points to swim

32:55.960 --> 33:01.340
But I did put points into survival. So I'm gonna use my survival instincts to remember how to swim

33:07.240 --> 33:10.680
What's your survival at 50 go ahead and roll on a 30

33:11.640 --> 33:13.640
Really negative 20

33:17.240 --> 33:21.680
21 that is a success. I that is a success

33:24.600 --> 33:28.960
Can't wrinkle off no fuck sorry, Jeremy petty more just like

33:29.480 --> 33:34.220
Hazardly throws his arms about thrashing in this fish filled water

33:34.220 --> 33:36.220
Oh

33:38.220 --> 33:45.220
Wait, I'm fine. I'm sorry and he crawls still think I'm cool on to the other side rolling my eyes a wet mess

33:45.220 --> 33:47.220
Hi Liz

33:48.020 --> 33:53.420
Rusty crawls out on the other side away from you on the other side. Yeah, do you run away?

33:53.420 --> 33:57.640
He looks at Jeremy petty more and holds out his hand

33:58.860 --> 34:00.860
for more flesh pencils

34:01.300 --> 34:05.500
Okay, I like I drop a couple on this side of the river but I move on

34:05.500 --> 34:09.820
Okay, as soon as you turn around and move on you hear him snacking behind you. He's cleared

34:10.460 --> 34:14.340
Jumping over this five-foot wide moat and he is with okay

34:14.340 --> 34:19.420
I want to leave Smokies like a like a little just a little trail the whole way I go

34:19.420 --> 34:25.060
All right, and you guys are approaching this cabin where I so you've got two buildings and a giant excavator

34:25.260 --> 34:33.140
One of the buildings is much smaller and is the size of like a small storage pod that you see sometimes in people's

34:33.180 --> 34:35.580
driveways like before or after a move and

34:36.700 --> 34:42.660
Then you have the cabin which has a front porch and a single door window on either side of the door

34:42.660 --> 34:46.440
Can we choose to look in the window before pursuing?

34:47.060 --> 34:49.300
Absolutely. All right, go ahead and roll stealth for me

34:50.700 --> 34:52.700
Jeremy petty more. What are you doing? I'm

34:53.060 --> 34:55.300
Edging my way towards the storage unit, okay

34:58.020 --> 35:01.280
I rolled an 85 so you stumble up the

35:01.700 --> 35:07.840
Stairs to the front porch of this cabin and like slam your hands down on the wooden porch

35:08.100 --> 35:14.040
And then you walk up and you stick your head up in the window and looking inside

35:14.980 --> 35:22.500
You see a lot of equipment that you have never seen in your entire life before this is not a home

35:22.880 --> 35:24.880
this is a lab and

35:26.300 --> 35:29.380
You see there are I'm having flashbacks to the OA

35:30.580 --> 35:33.140
Translucent tubes. That's your fucking sock. I

35:35.420 --> 35:37.780
Was just waiting for him to say that I

35:38.500 --> 35:43.380
We're not talking about the OA. Okay, at the end they stop a school shooting with their

35:44.420 --> 35:47.140
All right, the worst episode of television

35:48.020 --> 35:50.020
You can just cut this watch the whole thing

35:50.940 --> 35:52.980
First season. All right. Did you know?

35:53.700 --> 35:56.940
Okay, moving on not after the first season. I

35:57.700 --> 36:00.380
Heard it was good, but I can't imagine now. That's true

36:02.780 --> 36:04.780
There's the edit point

36:05.020 --> 36:10.980
Looking inside all of this equipment is completely outside your grasp. However, you see these

36:11.660 --> 36:18.140
translucent tubes that are running all over the place up the walls along the ceiling and

36:18.540 --> 36:21.620
Then they're going down into the floorboard

36:22.340 --> 36:25.420
underneath and they are all filled with a

36:26.020 --> 36:27.860
squeamish black

36:27.860 --> 36:34.140
Viscous goo that is making its way below the cabin around on the other sides

36:34.140 --> 36:41.320
You see a desk littered with papers so many papers strewn about there's like a cork board with a bunch of more papers

36:41.620 --> 36:47.460
Thumb tacked up to it and you see in the corner of the room. There is a

36:48.140 --> 36:50.140
large wooden trunk

36:50.500 --> 36:52.900
Jeremy petty more you are edging

36:56.140 --> 37:03.100
Go on your way make you wait for it. Yeah, you think so and

37:05.040 --> 37:10.900
You don't come across the storage yet

37:13.980 --> 37:17.780
But you you make your way over to the storage, you know

37:18.740 --> 37:26.020
Okay, there's a daily Jeremy petty more wants to know if our actions in the past can affect the future you're in your present

37:26.020 --> 37:31.460
I know so everything you do affects the future. Mm-hmm. What would you like to do Jeremy petty more?

37:31.460 --> 37:36.380
I'd like to try to get into the storage shed. All right, Lindsay. I'm gonna have you leave the room. All right

37:48.140 --> 37:50.140
You

37:51.340 --> 37:53.940
Jeremy petty more you open up the door to this

37:54.580 --> 37:55.780
small

37:55.780 --> 38:00.740
Rectangular room as you do so a light comes on inside

38:01.660 --> 38:03.660
It's dimly lit

38:03.900 --> 38:07.420
But as you walk in or poke your head in

38:08.580 --> 38:15.760
You see one side is a closet full of outfits on the other side of the room

38:15.760 --> 38:17.160
You

38:17.160 --> 38:19.880
Lined up hanging up against the wall

38:21.320 --> 38:23.320
Are the bodies of?

38:23.400 --> 38:25.400
roughly 15 people

38:25.560 --> 38:30.800
they are all hanging on hooks from a hole in the back of their neck and

38:32.440 --> 38:38.040
The way they are slumped makes you think that none of them have a spinal cord

38:39.880 --> 38:43.740
Jeremy anymore turns to the door and he screams

38:46.600 --> 38:48.600
Oh

38:52.600 --> 38:54.600
Roll sanity

38:58.120 --> 39:00.120
Yeah, then that was a great reaction

39:00.120 --> 39:02.120
You

39:14.960 --> 39:18.440
Lindsay I think you probably heard from the kitchen Thomas scream

39:22.240 --> 39:27.920
And you see Jeremy petty more fucking book it out of this small external room

39:28.880 --> 39:33.400
You're up on the porch, what do you do I run run towards the guy that helped us over the moat

39:33.640 --> 39:38.680
He's just like on the ground eating smokies. You gotta toss some smokies. Fuck. I call them

39:39.240 --> 39:45.920
I'm gonna like push him down and cross him over the bridge, but also leave some smokies behind me. So he doesn't totally hit us

39:46.720 --> 39:52.560
But like I am in panic mode. I am fucking bolting. I am making my rusty bridge

39:52.600 --> 39:56.120
I'm not even gonna worry about what's behind me. I'm just running for my life

39:56.120 --> 40:01.000
I need both of you to roll an alertness or survival

40:01.000 --> 40:06.040
Whichever one is higher for you. I passed both 30 on a 50 for both of those

40:09.680 --> 40:15.240
56 on a 50 56 on a 50. All right, this will basically be

40:16.960 --> 40:18.960
Lethality rule so

40:19.840 --> 40:21.680
Oh

40:21.680 --> 40:27.800
The two of you take off running you throw down rusty across the moat you make it to the other side you leave some

40:28.680 --> 40:30.680
micro rusty run

40:31.000 --> 40:39.000
Micro pains on the other side and as you dip into the woods Liz you hear a click underneath your foot

40:39.600 --> 40:44.060
Can I immediately stop sure without pulling my foot up? Yeah, absolutely

40:46.000 --> 40:48.220
And before you can let the breath out

40:49.800 --> 40:51.520
a

40:51.520 --> 40:53.520
giant metal claw

40:54.120 --> 41:01.320
Swings down from the branch on the tree above you and takes your head clean off as blood begins

41:02.440 --> 41:10.120
Burt out of the body above you and blood is literally showering like Vegas water feature style

41:10.640 --> 41:14.480
out of the space in between your shoulders and

41:15.240 --> 41:21.880
You fall to your knees like shooting a guy in the dick and double-oh-seven you like hit your knees and then you hit your

41:22.280 --> 41:24.280
shoulders on the ground

41:24.400 --> 41:29.340
Jeremy petty more roll a sanity check Jeremy petty more doesn't see any of Jeremy petty more didn't see

41:33.920 --> 41:38.900
Okay, actually roll alertness and see if you saw it you can do either one he's fine

41:40.600 --> 41:44.200
He sees it he knows that he's the survivor and he keeps going

41:44.800 --> 41:46.800
He got a 29

41:48.640 --> 41:54.460
He's like well that was the cool older punk girl had a crush on but better her than me

42:14.480 --> 42:16.480
Oh

42:28.480 --> 42:30.840
That the time has come

42:34.560 --> 42:41.240
To dance beneath a dance beneath the shadow of the moon

42:44.480 --> 43:04.040
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

43:04.040 --> 43:08.640
She moves, she moves, she moves

43:08.640 --> 43:12.640
With the howling wind

43:14.640 --> 43:20.440
The sun, the sun, the sun

43:20.440 --> 43:24.640
Has come again, come again

43:25.640 --> 43:31.240
Her eyes, her eyes

43:31.240 --> 43:35.240
Have seen it all

43:37.240 --> 43:42.240
The wonders of, the wonders of

43:42.240 --> 43:45.240
The shadow of the moon

43:54.640 --> 44:09.040
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
