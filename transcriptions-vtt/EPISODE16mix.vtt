00:00.000 --> 00:06.540
What is up my babies, do y'all know what time it is?

00:06.540 --> 00:12.220
It's time for your ear holes to get filled up by y'alls truly, Wolf, the dog.

00:12.220 --> 00:18.480
And your ears are absorbing these sounds from Contentions greatest radio show, broadcasting

00:18.480 --> 00:22.640
from 694.2 PTBP.

00:22.640 --> 00:27.680
This week's Howlin' with Wolf was submitted by a listener who tagged that pretending pod

00:27.680 --> 00:30.220
in their Instagram story.

00:30.220 --> 00:34.240
What a fuckin' champ, spreading the good news like that.

00:34.240 --> 00:41.120
They write, Better buckle up baby, because your new favorite band, Buckle Up Baby, is

00:41.120 --> 00:44.800
dropping their first tape this Friday, March 8th.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.720
Don't sleep on this one, don't be late.

00:47.720 --> 00:51.000
If you like fun, then save the date.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.460
Buckle Up Baby is celebrating their tape release with a live musical performance alongside

00:56.460 --> 01:02.060
Suzy Trash, Casual Cal, and Contentions own, Kudzu.

01:02.060 --> 01:09.380
This Friday, March 8th at 1703, South Fremont in Springfield, Missouri.

01:09.380 --> 01:11.980
That place sounds made up, y'all.

01:11.980 --> 01:15.140
Check out the track and use the internet to learn more.

01:15.140 --> 01:44.460
You are a bad teacher.

01:44.460 --> 01:46.740
Hell yes, my brothers.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.700
Now time for the news.

01:49.700 --> 01:53.420
Listeners were treated to a blast from Clark Bishop's past.

01:53.420 --> 01:58.820
But it was less of a treat for Clark, who found himself locked in the public library

01:58.820 --> 02:03.460
with Gerald Fingerson as the sky turned completely dark.

02:03.460 --> 02:09.860
The doors were locked by a cloaked figure who began chasing after a tall man in a suit.

02:09.860 --> 02:13.740
That sadly was not the worst of it, my babies.

02:13.740 --> 02:21.180
Clark got back home only to find his reality shattering, eventually remembering the confession

02:21.180 --> 02:23.860
of the woman who killed his parents.

02:23.860 --> 02:27.920
Man, I didn't know they had a new Clark dirty like that.

02:27.920 --> 02:33.580
Back in the real world, the officers went to the Daily Fur after Gary Daly called in

02:33.580 --> 02:37.400
to report information about the chief's disappearance.

02:37.400 --> 02:43.020
They learned the chief arrived to her home accompanied by James, who works at the mill,

02:43.020 --> 02:46.180
and another man who held them at gunpoint.

02:46.180 --> 02:50.100
The gunman was in all black and had a scar over his eye.

02:50.100 --> 02:55.700
Gary Daly saw this because he was following Harold Dorsey, the writer from the city who

02:55.700 --> 02:58.280
took Drew to the chief's home.

02:58.280 --> 03:04.400
The officers, always utilizing their time mighty efficiently, spent a while asking Gary

03:04.400 --> 03:08.780
Daly about the art he was hanging in his restaurant.

03:08.780 --> 03:14.860
Now y'all know your old buddy Wolf is a connoisseur of sorts of the arts, but the only art he

03:14.860 --> 03:19.900
ever has time for is Kudzu's No Backbone.

03:38.780 --> 03:51.500
All right, welcome everybody.

03:51.500 --> 03:56.620
We are doing flashbacks today and right now we're doing a John Lee Pettymore's flashback

03:56.620 --> 04:01.460
and our friend Justin is here with us today to play, who are you playing?

04:01.460 --> 04:05.300
I am playing one Don D. Pettymore.

04:05.300 --> 04:06.580
And who is that?

04:06.580 --> 04:10.920
I am this John Lee Pettymore's uncle.

04:10.920 --> 04:11.920
Kind of uncle.

04:11.920 --> 04:16.500
I'm his dad's cousin, but I'm only like 13, 14 years older than him.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.500
Yeah.

04:17.500 --> 04:18.500
Does that sound good?

04:18.500 --> 04:19.500
Mm-hmm.

04:19.500 --> 04:20.500
Does it sound good?

04:20.500 --> 04:21.500
I need to look at the mic more.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.880
Can I rearrange it really quick?

04:23.880 --> 04:25.960
Just pretend like the mic is...

04:25.960 --> 04:26.960
One with me?

04:26.960 --> 04:30.180
A muppet that you never want to kiss, but that always wants to kiss you.

04:30.180 --> 04:31.180
But you want to get real close?

04:31.180 --> 04:32.860
You got to stay just out.

04:32.860 --> 04:35.240
You're trying to tease the muppet.

04:35.240 --> 04:39.120
Something you always want to stay out of.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.080
Just don't let the muppet get what it wants.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.080
Stay away.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.240
Never let a muppet get what it wants.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.240
No.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.240
I think that's...

04:45.240 --> 04:46.880
If you give a muppet a cookie.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.200
I mean, crumbs are everywhere.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.200
It'll get everywhere.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.240
Have you ever tried to clean a fucking muppet?

04:52.240 --> 05:02.800
All right, so today we are flashing back to an essential moment, a very important time

05:02.800 --> 05:06.880
in the life of John Lee Pettymore.

05:06.880 --> 05:13.460
This is the moment that John Lee Pettymore's sprint car racing career is cut short in a

05:13.460 --> 05:15.320
horrible accident.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.680
And John Lee Pettymore has prepared a little monologue.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.680
I believe you've prepared some words.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.680
About his experience, yes.

05:22.680 --> 05:27.640
Hold on, let me...

05:27.640 --> 05:40.640
What propels a man?

05:40.640 --> 05:44.040
What propels a man to seek glory?

05:44.040 --> 05:49.660
What propels a man to test his mettle, to meld his talents with that of a machine and

05:49.660 --> 05:53.480
together seek victory?

05:53.480 --> 05:57.720
What was propelling me through the air and towards the hard steel of the Contention County

05:57.720 --> 06:00.040
Speedway's main grandstand?

06:00.040 --> 06:05.000
I briefly had time to consider all this as I was thrown free of my sprint car and head

06:05.000 --> 06:10.020
first into the abundant lap of Mrs. Eldora Jane Duncans.

06:10.020 --> 06:14.440
To her great fortune, God saw fit to place a support girder in my trajectory, and that

06:14.440 --> 06:19.000
girder shattered my pelvis and snapped my right leg, sparing Mrs. Eldora the full force

06:19.000 --> 06:20.720
of my impact.

06:20.720 --> 06:24.520
Dear boy, Elvis Jr. was not as lucky.

06:24.520 --> 06:29.420
The flying buckle of my defective safety harness took his eye in an instant.

06:29.420 --> 06:31.760
God was all out of girders.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.080
What propels a man?

06:33.080 --> 06:37.100
I didn't figure that one out before I lost consciousness, but as I flew towards the grandstands

06:37.100 --> 06:40.760
I could see with perfect clarity who had propelled me there.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.400
Laura Jetty.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.400
Dickhead.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.400
Chucklefuck.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.400
Shitbird.

06:45.400 --> 06:48.620
King of the sprint racing circuit.

06:48.620 --> 06:52.300
She had cut across my line and forced me into a wall.

06:52.300 --> 06:55.860
The corners I had cut to get there in the first place did the rest.

06:55.860 --> 06:59.780
Ordering a race-used harness in fair condition from eBay wasn't the best idea, but I could

06:59.780 --> 07:02.460
only stretch Uncle Don's money so far.

07:02.460 --> 07:08.360
Turns out it stretched just as far as a young boy's eye, which was farther than my luck.

07:08.360 --> 07:13.420
Every scrap of it that had propelled me here had burnt out.

07:13.420 --> 07:17.940
Don D. Pettymore looked out at the world from dead eyes.

07:18.060 --> 07:22.300
Uncle Don came from the hard side of the family, the side that had starved before and vowed

07:22.300 --> 07:26.300
to never starve again, and now I owed him real money.

07:26.300 --> 07:31.140
Adora's screams grew more distant as I faded out of consciousness, and the last thing I

07:31.140 --> 07:35.260
remember seeing is Uncle Don's unknowable expression, peering straight down at me.

07:36.940 --> 07:38.940
Fuck yeah!

07:38.940 --> 07:40.940
That's some good shit.

07:40.940 --> 07:42.940
Thank you, that's uh...

07:42.940 --> 07:44.940
I'm not really, uh...

07:44.940 --> 07:48.940
John Lee Pettymore, me, is not the creative writing type, so...

07:48.940 --> 07:50.940
But uh...

07:50.940 --> 07:57.940
My physical therapist, Jane, she really worked me through my shattered pelvis and leg, and

07:57.940 --> 07:58.940
she suggested that...

07:58.940 --> 07:59.940
Journaling?

07:59.940 --> 08:02.940
Well, yeah, I mean, in other words...

08:02.940 --> 08:03.940
Writing prose and whatnot?

08:03.940 --> 08:12.340
Well, yeah, she suggested that perhaps my mental spiritual self was also shattered like

08:12.340 --> 08:15.340
my pelvis, and that it might help to get some of that out.

08:15.340 --> 08:19.340
Dude, a haiku or two would heal you.

08:19.340 --> 08:21.340
Haiku?

08:21.340 --> 08:23.340
That didn't come out right.

08:23.340 --> 08:24.340
Hold up.

08:24.340 --> 08:26.340
Haiku?

08:29.340 --> 08:31.340
Okay, let me get some of those names.

08:31.340 --> 08:35.340
I crashed into the family of Miss Aldora Jane Duncans.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.340
Aldora Jane Duncans?

08:37.340 --> 08:39.340
Yeah, married to Elvis Duncans.

08:39.340 --> 08:40.340
How do you spell Duncans?

08:40.340 --> 08:42.340
Duncans like the donuts.

08:42.340 --> 08:43.340
And...

08:43.340 --> 08:44.340
Not like the basketball?

08:44.340 --> 08:49.340
No, also like the basketball, but if you're doing it with an apostrophe.

08:49.340 --> 08:50.340
Okay.

08:50.340 --> 08:52.340
If you're Duncan.

08:52.340 --> 08:54.340
And her son was in the race?

08:54.340 --> 09:00.340
No, her son was seated next to her, the young Elvis Duncans Jr.

09:00.340 --> 09:06.340
And my safety buckle, which had separated, it was a defective piece of equipment that

09:06.340 --> 09:11.340
what happened there is that it flew into the young boy's eye and took it from him, as

09:11.340 --> 09:17.340
the Lord is wont to take many things from us in his mysterious and unknowable mycenations.

09:17.340 --> 09:19.340
Mycenations.

09:19.340 --> 09:21.340
Oh, man.

09:21.340 --> 09:23.340
Oh, man, talking so hard.

09:23.340 --> 09:25.340
Talking so goddamn hard, man.

09:25.340 --> 09:27.340
I hate talking.

09:27.340 --> 09:29.340
Fuck.

09:29.340 --> 09:35.340
Okay, so we're going to cut to the scene.

09:35.340 --> 09:41.340
Don and John are sitting in the back of the ambulance from the Contention County Speedway,

09:41.340 --> 09:49.340
and the EMT who works there is checking out John, and actually she kind of walks up and

09:49.340 --> 09:53.340
eh, well, eh, there's just no way.

09:53.340 --> 09:54.340
Never going to race again.

09:54.340 --> 09:57.340
I don't see any way around it.

09:57.340 --> 10:02.340
Yeah, I mean, I don't see myself ever getting the money together to get back into something

10:02.340 --> 10:06.340
like this, but how did you know that about me?

10:06.340 --> 10:12.340
Oh, no, I just mean that there's no way that you're going to be able to race again, not

10:12.340 --> 10:14.340
around here at least, that's for sure.

10:14.340 --> 10:16.340
You're just, you're an EMT.

10:16.340 --> 10:19.340
You're not involved with the race officials or anything.

10:19.340 --> 10:22.340
Why are you, what a thing to tell a man in recovery.

10:22.340 --> 10:29.340
She kind of pulls Don aside, and you can very clearly hear her talking.

10:29.340 --> 10:37.340
She's just like, yeah, well, see the issue being that for sure the Duncans aren't going

10:37.340 --> 10:41.340
to take too kindly to their boy losing an eye.

10:41.340 --> 10:47.340
You know how, you know, Patriarch Duncan owns the Contention County Speedway as well as

10:47.340 --> 10:51.340
almost all the speedways in this region.

10:51.340 --> 10:58.340
I just don't see any way that he's going to allow Jon to get on the track ever again.

10:58.340 --> 11:01.340
So I think y'all might be done fucked.

11:01.340 --> 11:03.340
My dreams.

11:03.340 --> 11:05.340
My dang dreams.

11:05.340 --> 11:07.340
My dang dreams.

11:07.340 --> 11:09.340
My dang dreams.

11:09.340 --> 11:12.340
What are you trying to tell me?

11:12.340 --> 11:13.340
That my dream is over?

11:13.340 --> 11:15.340
I turn away from.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.340
Her name is Ernti.

11:17.340 --> 11:18.340
Ernti.

11:18.340 --> 11:25.340
I turn away from Ernti and I look at my boy who, wait, is his dad dead?

11:25.340 --> 11:26.340
Yes.

11:26.340 --> 11:32.340
Okay, I wasn't sure if I, I look at him like he's my own, my own son.

11:32.340 --> 11:33.340
He is my own flesh and blood.

11:33.340 --> 11:37.340
And I walk over to him and I grab his face and I look at him.

11:37.340 --> 11:39.340
Uncle Don, how?

11:39.340 --> 11:40.340
Look at me boy.

11:40.340 --> 11:43.340
You're going to have to give up on this dream now.

11:43.340 --> 11:44.340
Don't.

11:44.340 --> 11:45.340
You got to face reality, boy.

11:45.340 --> 11:46.340
No, Don.

11:46.340 --> 11:47.340
You got to face it.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.340
No, Don.

11:48.340 --> 11:51.340
Why am I going to face it today, Don?

11:51.340 --> 11:53.340
What am I going to do?

11:53.340 --> 11:58.340
I pull his head gingerly towards my head and give him a warm embrace that I've given no

11:58.340 --> 11:59.340
one before.

11:59.340 --> 12:01.340
I didn't expect this kind of thing from you.

12:01.340 --> 12:02.340
It's okay, boy.

12:02.340 --> 12:03.340
We're going to be all right.

12:03.340 --> 12:04.340
I owe you so much money.

12:04.340 --> 12:06.340
Yeah, we're going to figure that out.

12:06.340 --> 12:09.340
Are you going to kill me?

12:09.340 --> 12:12.340
I say nothing.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.340
Whoa.

12:14.340 --> 12:21.340
So John asks if Don is going to kill him and Don just stares coldly at him.

12:21.340 --> 12:30.340
And next we see Don pushing John in a wheelchair because you can't afford that ambulance ride.

12:30.340 --> 12:34.340
Not after you lost a lot of money in that crash just now.

12:34.340 --> 12:38.340
So you decide to drive and on your way, actually it's kind of weird.

12:38.340 --> 12:43.340
Don, you see these two figures.

12:43.340 --> 12:46.340
John, you don't see this because you're in a wheelchair.

12:46.340 --> 12:52.340
But Don, you see these two figures that are watching you from behind, kind of on the side

12:52.340 --> 12:53.340
of the track.

12:53.340 --> 12:58.340
And as you're walking out, they begin approaching you from the back.

12:58.340 --> 13:06.680
They are both extremely tall people with large frames, but they are very gaunt and they begin

13:06.680 --> 13:09.020
walking faster and faster toward you.

13:09.020 --> 13:13.680
And they are going to catch up with you if you don't begin to move a bit faster there.

13:13.680 --> 13:14.680
John, you ready to hustle, boy?

13:14.680 --> 13:17.680
We're getting off this track.

13:17.680 --> 13:18.680
I'm in a wheelchair, man.

13:18.680 --> 13:19.680
How am I going to hustle?

13:19.680 --> 13:21.680
I start shoveling on real quick.

13:21.680 --> 13:24.680
Whoa, Don, we're going too fast.

13:24.680 --> 13:30.180
You guys are flying and Don is just running in a full sprint at this point with John in

13:30.180 --> 13:31.680
the wheelchair ahead of him.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.680
And these two figures are catching up.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.680
There's no one else around, weirdly enough.

13:36.680 --> 13:41.680
As soon as you see them, no one else seems to be on the track.

13:41.680 --> 13:46.680
And you see as they're approaching on you, Don, you're looking backward as you're running.

13:46.680 --> 13:53.680
They're both wearing black suits and their skin is weirdly translucent.

13:53.680 --> 13:59.680
And as you guys are running and running and running, one of them just starts screaming.

13:59.680 --> 14:08.680
This, like, weird, banshee type yell is just like...

14:08.680 --> 14:11.680
As they're running toward you and then...

14:11.680 --> 14:17.680
Hey, hey, you fancy, you fancy men, you fucking stay away.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.680
Go on.

14:20.680 --> 14:27.680
Get, get, as you yell, get at these fancy men that are following you.

14:27.680 --> 14:31.680
Fanciest men John Lee Bettymore has ever seen.

14:31.680 --> 14:38.680
You turn back to look at the parking lot and not only is the parking lot full of people,

14:38.680 --> 14:47.680
but you do see your car, Don, that you both came in today.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.680
Hell yeah.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.680
Surrogate, son.

14:53.680 --> 14:58.680
And, actually, large Eddie.

14:58.680 --> 15:08.680
Hold up, please give me time to think of a dope Second Cousins fucking pun.

15:08.680 --> 15:10.680
I got nothing.

15:10.680 --> 15:11.680
It's hard.

15:11.680 --> 15:16.680
Second Cousins give good loving, that's not very good.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.680
That's just the Hall & Oates song.

15:18.680 --> 15:22.680
Second Cousins give good loving.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.680
Oh boy, we missed it.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.680
You missed it, it's my song.

15:27.680 --> 15:38.680
As you're looking into the parking lot, you would see that your car is currently being flipped over by large Eddie and his pit grew.

15:38.680 --> 15:40.680
What the hell, Eddie?

15:40.680 --> 15:41.680
God damn it, Eddie.

15:41.680 --> 15:49.680
Eddie, you fucking knocked me out of this race, you son of a bitch, you dickhead fuck, and now you're gonna fuck with my car, you piece of shit, and I'm in this goddamn wheelchair?

15:49.680 --> 15:52.680
Eddie, you're gonna rule the day you fucked with the petty, Morris.

15:52.680 --> 15:58.680
I'm gonna do whatever it is I wanna do, cause I'm large Eddie.

15:58.680 --> 16:08.680
And he begins walking toward you guys as his crew continues to try to lift, but they're clearly having a harder time now that large Eddie isn't helping them.

16:08.680 --> 16:09.680
How large is he?

16:09.680 --> 16:11.680
And so they're trying to make it.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.680
He's like 6'5", which is not a-

16:13.680 --> 16:15.680
He's larger than you think would fit in a sprint car.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.680
Not a traditional build for a sprint car driver.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.680
He seems as large as a sprint car is.

16:22.680 --> 16:31.680
He is, yeah, he's thick, he's skinny strong though, you know, he's like, he's stringy, but he's real strong looking.

16:31.680 --> 16:36.680
And he walks right up to Don and he's like, say something.

16:36.680 --> 16:37.680
Do it.

16:40.680 --> 16:41.680
Do it.

16:41.680 --> 16:42.680
Do it.

16:42.680 --> 16:44.680
Don't make me fucking do it, Eddie.

16:44.680 --> 16:45.680
Say something.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.680
Hey, I'm walking, I'm large Eddie, I'm walking here.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.680
Yo, large Eddie, fucking do it.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.680
Fucking do it.

16:50.680 --> 16:51.680
Fucking do it.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.680
Do it, dude, push me in the face, dude.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.680
Fucking do it, Don.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.680
Don, you think you got shit?

16:56.680 --> 17:01.680
I take quite a large swing at this gentleman right in the face.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.680
Oh damn, okay.

17:03.680 --> 17:04.680
Oh damn.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.680
Yeah, you swing away, what happens?

17:08.680 --> 17:13.680
I just clock that son of a bitch in the face for fucking with me and my boy cousin.

17:13.680 --> 17:18.680
Large Eddie, you loud-mouthed son of a bitch, that's what you get, you fucking piece of shit.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.680
God damn, Uncle Don.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.680
This is man's business now.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.680
Okay, so let me get this straight.

17:29.680 --> 17:38.680
This guy walks up, he's talking shit, you hit him, John starts talking shit to this guy on the ground and you tell him to shut the fuck up?

17:38.680 --> 17:41.680
Shut your mouth, bull ass, and respect.

17:43.680 --> 17:48.680
Large Eddie gets up again and looks at you and he just like...

17:48.680 --> 17:53.680
You know, he does that thing where he like grabs his jaw and he starts rubbing it.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.680
Am I close enough in my wheelchair to kick him in the ball with my cowboy boots?

17:56.680 --> 17:57.680
Yeah, you can kick him in the ball.

17:57.680 --> 17:58.680
Okay.

17:58.680 --> 17:59.680
Do your legs work?

17:59.680 --> 18:01.680
Oh yeah, well, not my right one.

18:02.680 --> 18:03.680
Actually, you know what?

18:03.680 --> 18:07.680
It's inconsistent with the injuries I've received to be able to kick him in the balls.

18:07.680 --> 18:08.680
Very inconsistent.

18:08.680 --> 18:12.680
Anyway, I guess I just think real hard about kicking him in the balls and how cool it would be.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.680
You want to. Oh, you want to so bad.

18:14.680 --> 18:15.680
He just sees it in my eyes.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.680
But it hurts to think about it.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.680
Everything hurts right now, to be honest.

18:19.680 --> 18:23.680
My pelvis is shattered and I haven't been to the hospital yet. I'm just in a wheelchair.

18:23.680 --> 18:29.680
You're extremely concussed. You're just sitting in a wheelchair. He just pushed you very rapidly over what I'm guessing is gravel.

18:29.680 --> 18:30.680
There are still fancy men chasing us.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.680
A lot of rocks.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.680
And there are fancy men that might be chasing you. You haven't looked back.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.680
Oh, Justin.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.680
I look back. I assess the situation.

18:38.680 --> 18:39.680
There's actually no one there.

18:39.680 --> 18:43.680
Oh, that's scary. But good. For the moment, I suppose.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.680
A spooky portent of things to come.

18:45.680 --> 18:49.680
I do think that I need to solve this situation quick and forthright.

18:49.680 --> 18:52.680
So I look at the man. Is the man coming towards me?

18:52.680 --> 18:58.680
He's just, he's doing that thing with his jaw where he's just rubbing it and he's like, ah.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.680
And he just kind of growls and then he spits on the ground.

19:01.680 --> 19:04.680
Now you get the fuck out of our way and let us go about our day.

19:04.680 --> 19:09.680
I got to take this injured boy to the local doctor hospital.

19:12.680 --> 19:13.680
Fine.

19:13.680 --> 19:14.680
Yeah, what do you got to say to that, Eddie?

19:14.680 --> 19:22.680
He looks down and he's like, you're going to need to go to the city hospital after I get done with you.

19:22.680 --> 19:25.680
And he goes to throw a punch at Don.

19:25.680 --> 19:29.680
I mutter under my breath as I catch his hand with my hand.

19:30.680 --> 19:31.680
Catch these hands.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.680
But I'm literally catching his hand.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.680
And what happens next?

19:36.680 --> 19:41.680
His hand starts a sizzling like a, like a country fried steak on a Sunday morning.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.680
Yeah.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.680
And smoke starts coming out of it.

19:44.680 --> 19:45.680
I assume it hurts.

19:45.680 --> 19:46.680
And he starts screaming.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.680
He's like, ah.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.680
Oh God. Oh, Don.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.680
And I'm like, Eddie, you ready to stop, boy?

19:53.680 --> 19:56.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.680
I hold on for a couple more seconds.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.680
Oh, it's excruciating.

20:00.680 --> 20:04.680
I drop his hand and then I give him one more in the face again.

20:04.680 --> 20:06.680
He runs away like a beat dog.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.680
He, I mean, he just runs away.

20:08.680 --> 20:09.680
He gets his crew.

20:09.680 --> 20:14.680
They set your car down and he, and he gets out of there as fast as he possibly can.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.680
I want to shovel my boy into that there car.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.680
I'm going to show him how a real man drives.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.680
Damn, Don.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.680
Why do you got to kick a man while he's down?

20:25.680 --> 20:26.680
I was driving pretty good today.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.680
You owe me so much goddamn money.

20:28.680 --> 20:29.680
I know, Don.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.680
Don, in your concussed state, man, you have no idea what's been going on.

20:32.680 --> 20:36.680
You're just like from one place to the next and then you end up in the hospital.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.680
Did we get brunch with Large Eddie?

20:40.680 --> 20:41.680
I think we're finished with that.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.680
Did we get brunch with Large Eddie?

21:00.680 --> 21:04.680
Keith Vigna, roll me an intelligence check real quick.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.680
Pass 16 on 50.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.680
He's very smart.

21:09.680 --> 21:15.680
The hunched over guy, unkempt, was wearing large rubber waders.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.680
Okay.

21:16.680 --> 21:19.680
On his bottom half of his body, like waders.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.680
Wait, I forgot what we know already.

21:21.680 --> 21:26.680
You saw in the house, the guy slumped over with the bolt hole in his head, the unkempt man,

21:26.680 --> 21:28.680
he was wearing big rubber waders.

21:28.680 --> 21:29.680
What do we know about James?

21:29.680 --> 21:30.680
Not that.

21:30.680 --> 21:35.680
Go ahead and Clark and John, who has the higher intelligence between you guys?

21:35.680 --> 21:36.680
I've got a 55.

21:36.680 --> 21:37.680
75.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.680
All right, John, go ahead and roll.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.680
57 on a 75.

21:41.680 --> 21:47.680
You would remember that the man with the vacuum in his front yard was also wearing rubber waders.

21:47.680 --> 21:52.680
Also, looking at the address that Keith has written down from the phone book,

21:52.680 --> 21:57.680
you would notice that the address for James is on the same street in the suburbs

21:57.680 --> 22:00.680
as the house that Dr. Marie Jacobs lives in.

22:00.680 --> 22:01.680
Okay.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.680
So it's likely that that was James.

22:03.680 --> 22:07.680
That the guy in rubber waders that you saw on that street is James.

22:07.680 --> 22:08.680
We should go to the mill.

22:08.680 --> 22:11.680
Yeah, let's not examine this at all.

22:11.680 --> 22:12.680
I mean, James is dead.

22:12.680 --> 22:13.680
Long live James.

22:13.680 --> 22:14.680
He might not be.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.680
He was in the house explosion, though.

22:16.680 --> 22:17.680
Was he?

22:17.680 --> 22:18.680
With a bullet hole in his head.

22:18.680 --> 22:19.680
Oh, that's, yeah, fuck.

22:19.680 --> 22:23.680
He was dead before the house exploded, and he's double dead now.

22:23.680 --> 22:24.680
Double dead.

22:24.680 --> 22:25.680
Double dude?

22:25.680 --> 22:30.680
I guess Joe is asking, why did Keith have that realization suddenly?

22:30.680 --> 22:32.680
It just reminded him.

22:32.680 --> 22:35.680
I mean, it was a very tense moment when he was going through the house,

22:35.680 --> 22:40.680
and he didn't pick up on every detail that was happening around him at the time.

22:40.680 --> 22:46.680
So I went ahead and had him roll intelligence to recall a detail that had been forgotten to him before.

22:46.680 --> 22:47.680
Perfect.

22:47.680 --> 22:48.680
I dig it.

22:48.680 --> 22:54.680
I think we ought to follow up on the leads that we were looking at before the whole Nike bag thing.

22:54.680 --> 22:59.680
Well, I mean, from our standpoint, we know our chief is dead, and she was-

22:59.680 --> 23:05.680
As far as we know, but also remember how you came in and talked to Drew, and it wasn't you?

23:05.680 --> 23:06.680
Gary said something.

23:06.680 --> 23:11.680
Keith, that is the first smart thing you have ever said.

23:11.680 --> 23:12.680
Thank you.

23:12.680 --> 23:20.680
I just, I remembered Gary said something along the lines of, she wasn't standing up straight the way that Chief Cook would.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.680
That is almost police work.

23:22.680 --> 23:24.680
Good work on that there, Keith.

23:24.680 --> 23:26.680
It might not be Maggie.

23:26.680 --> 23:36.680
I mean, I saw her with my own eyes, but these days I don't know if I believe what I see anymore.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.680
We do know that her car, though, was at the mill.

23:39.680 --> 23:43.680
We do know that her car, though, was at the mill for an extended period of time.

23:43.680 --> 23:45.680
Right, and that's why I think we ought to check out the mill.

23:45.680 --> 23:49.680
We ought to, I don't think we need to do the dentist thing anymore, because I'm pretty sure that was James.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.680
And then what was the other thing?

23:51.680 --> 23:52.680
Oh, the church.

23:52.680 --> 23:53.680
The helmet.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.680
Should we go to the church or the mill first?

23:55.680 --> 23:56.680
I think-

23:58.680 --> 23:59.680
Fuck.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.680
Because her dad worked at the mill, right?

24:01.680 --> 24:04.680
I think the mill is going to tie a lot of things together.

24:04.680 --> 24:11.680
Right now, a loose end is that helmet out in civilian hands with God knows what it is.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.680
Let's go get the helmet, because we got all the other things.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.680
We might as well have it all together.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.680
That way we know a little more.

24:17.680 --> 24:22.680
We ought to just go do it now, because we have the gun, we have the radio-

24:22.680 --> 24:24.680
Yeah, and the camera.

24:24.680 --> 24:25.680
And the camera.

24:25.680 --> 24:26.680
I hate to say this, though.

24:26.680 --> 24:30.680
Maybe we should split up, because time might be of the essence in both these matters.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.680
I'll go to the church.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.680
What do you think is more important?

24:34.680 --> 24:36.680
That's a great question.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.680
What time is it right now?

24:41.680 --> 24:43.680
Oh, it's probably noon.

24:43.680 --> 24:46.680
I go back in and I get a pho to go.

24:46.680 --> 24:47.680
Pho to go?

24:47.680 --> 24:48.680
Pho to go.

24:48.680 --> 24:49.680
A pho to go?

24:49.680 --> 24:50.680
A pho to go.

24:50.680 --> 24:51.680
Take home a pho.

24:51.680 --> 24:52.680
Take home a pho?

24:52.680 --> 24:53.680
Do you get the pho to go?

24:53.680 --> 24:55.680
Hey, Gary, what's your most popular pho?

24:55.680 --> 24:56.680
Tri-tip.

24:56.680 --> 24:57.680
Seafood.

24:57.680 --> 25:00.680
Ooh, what kind of- what's a seafood?

25:00.680 --> 25:02.680
Oh, it's got all sorts of tentacles in there.

25:02.680 --> 25:03.680
Yeah, give me that.

25:03.680 --> 25:04.680
To go, please.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.680
One small seafood pho to go.

25:06.680 --> 25:07.680
Okay.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.680
Extra pho.

25:09.680 --> 25:14.680
One small seafood pho extra pho coming right up.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.680
What do you guys want you- who should hit where?

25:17.680 --> 25:19.680
I'm just so hesitant to split up.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.680
I just- yeah, off- maybe off mic or just out of character.

25:22.680 --> 25:27.680
I totally feel like Zach is gonna fuck us, and like something's going down at the mill right now,

25:27.680 --> 25:28.680
and like we have to be there.

25:28.680 --> 25:29.680
We should not split up.

25:29.680 --> 25:36.680
As fun as it is to do, and as fun as it is to like, listen back and how much I fuck up on my own,

25:36.680 --> 25:38.680
I think maybe we should stick together for this one?

25:38.680 --> 25:40.680
We shouldn't trust anything to make no-

25:40.680 --> 25:44.680
I think if you guys split up and one of you went to the mill, one of you went to the church,

25:44.680 --> 25:48.680
one of you went to James, the mill worker, like the guy who worked at the mill, his house,

25:48.680 --> 25:51.680
like if one of you went to each of those locations-

25:51.680 --> 25:53.680
We might have accomplished a lot.

25:53.680 --> 25:54.680
That would be fine.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.680
It would be fine.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.680
You say that, but- I mean, okay, what-

25:59.680 --> 26:01.680
Fucking DMs.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.680
What would-

26:03.680 --> 26:05.680
I think that you would all have a great time.

26:05.680 --> 26:07.680
What would a real police station do?

26:07.680 --> 26:09.680
Well, okay, so that's what I was actually going through.

26:09.680 --> 26:15.680
We now have this new purpose given to us by an unknown entity of figuring out crazy shit,

26:15.680 --> 26:17.680
which would be the helmet.

26:17.680 --> 26:21.680
But, as police officers, we've worked with Maggie for a long time, so the mill would also-

26:21.680 --> 26:24.680
We would have it in our hearts to be-

26:24.680 --> 26:27.680
So that's why I'm saying we're real conflicted about what would be important to us.

26:27.680 --> 26:30.680
Wait, okay, we don't have to ask them any fucking questions.

26:30.680 --> 26:33.680
All we have to do is bust into that church and say-

26:33.680 --> 26:34.680
Give it to us.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.680
We're confiscating this helmet like it's part of the-

26:36.680 --> 26:38.680
It's evidence in an investigation.

26:38.680 --> 26:39.680
And then we go to the mill right after.

26:39.680 --> 26:42.680
We will talk to you about it later, but we need that right now.

26:42.680 --> 26:43.680
Let's do it.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.680
Let's try that.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.680
Let's do it. Good police work, guys.

26:46.680 --> 26:47.680
Where's the church at?

26:47.680 --> 26:48.680
Yeah, where's the mill at?

26:48.680 --> 26:50.680
Where's the church at, Keith asks.

26:50.680 --> 26:52.680
Oh, shit, that's real handy.

26:52.680 --> 26:53.680
That's real handy.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.680
It's right around the corner for the listener.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.680
Maybe we should go to the mill first.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.680
Where is the mill?

26:58.680 --> 27:00.680
The mill is on the other side of the city.

27:00.680 --> 27:01.680
Of the town.

27:01.680 --> 27:02.680
Of the city.

27:02.680 --> 27:04.680
Oh, really? It's like on the other side of the big city?

27:04.680 --> 27:05.680
The mill?

27:05.680 --> 27:09.680
Yeah, well, let's definitely go swing by the church and then go out to the city.

27:09.680 --> 27:10.680
But all these people work there?

27:10.680 --> 27:12.680
I mean, how far away is it?

27:12.680 --> 27:14.680
It's like 45 minutes to an hour away.

27:14.680 --> 27:15.680
It's not a bad-

27:15.680 --> 27:17.680
I just figured it was like the town's mill.

27:17.680 --> 27:18.680
Same.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.680
The mill.

27:19.680 --> 27:20.680
Yeah, well, you were fucking wrong.

27:20.680 --> 27:21.680
The mill.

27:21.680 --> 27:22.680
Let's go over here and then head on out to the mill.

27:22.680 --> 27:23.680
Yeah, I agree.

27:23.680 --> 27:24.680
Let's swing by the church.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.680
It's literally right around the corner.

27:26.680 --> 27:27.680
There's no reason not to.

27:27.680 --> 27:28.680
Sounds good.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.680
Are you getting into one vehicle to go?

27:31.680 --> 27:32.680
Let's take all three.

27:32.680 --> 27:33.680
Yeah, let's take all three.

27:33.680 --> 27:39.680
The quickest path to the church of contention would take you over a small bridge.

27:39.680 --> 27:43.680
There is a creek running underneath the bridge.

27:43.680 --> 27:50.680
And as you go over the bridge, you would all notice something pretty odd.

27:50.680 --> 27:56.680
The water is filled with animals.

27:56.680 --> 28:00.680
There are dogs and cats hanging out in the water.

28:00.680 --> 28:11.680
There are also raccoons, skunks, squirrels, possums, badgers, weasels, and minks all hanging out in the water.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.680
Do I see an old black lab?

28:13.680 --> 28:17.680
Go ahead and search for me.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.680
Fail, 95 on a 20.

28:19.680 --> 28:24.680
You do not see an old black lab, but you do see all the aforementioned animals.

28:24.680 --> 28:33.680
They are all hanging out in what would be the deepest part of the water, the most center part, furthest away from land on either side.

28:33.680 --> 28:38.680
I want to slow down on the bridge, roll down my window, and go, Tyler!

28:38.680 --> 28:40.680
Come here, Tyler!

28:40.680 --> 28:41.680
You do that.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.680
Any dog come up running my direction?

28:43.680 --> 28:45.680
Do any of the animals look at him at all?

28:45.680 --> 28:48.680
Or are they all focused on something in the creek?

28:48.680 --> 28:56.680
All the animals are facing the land, and they all look to be on edge, but they're all in the water.

28:56.680 --> 28:59.680
Do any of the cats resemble Marie Jacobs' cat?

28:59.680 --> 29:08.680
In that part of the creek, there are three different black cats that all look to be similar.

29:08.680 --> 29:14.680
Out of character, I'm thinking classic animals, you know, when they know a tornado's coming or some shit like that.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.680
What if they know something we don't?

29:17.680 --> 29:20.680
Because this is a very, very weird thing.

29:20.680 --> 29:23.680
My sanity is at... I pass.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.680
Hell yeah.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.680
Yeah, I passed.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.680
I passed. 21 on a 41.

29:27.680 --> 29:31.680
Okay. What is your rationalization? Does none of you lose sanity?

29:31.680 --> 29:33.680
Pool party for the animals.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.680
It's hot outside.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.680
It's hot out.

29:38.680 --> 29:43.680
It's December. I mean, it's unseasonably warm still, I would say, but it is December.

29:43.680 --> 29:50.680
Somebody must have dumped a bunch of real good animal food in that river, upriver, and it's all collected down here.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.680
Maybe the cable factory has exploded.

29:53.680 --> 29:59.680
Out of character, they probably know that maybe the goo or whatever we're fighting can't go...

29:59.680 --> 30:00.680
Get in water.

30:00.680 --> 30:01.680
Get in water, yeah.

30:01.680 --> 30:02.680
I was thinking that too.

30:02.680 --> 30:05.680
But Keith would not ever think that, so...

30:05.680 --> 30:06.680
Why are you slowing down?

30:06.680 --> 30:08.680
You say over the radio?

30:08.680 --> 30:09.680
Yeah.

30:09.680 --> 30:14.680
Oh, you know, that Carrie Page, that councilwoman, she lost that dog.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.680
I just thought maybe it ran over here with all these other animals.

30:17.680 --> 30:19.680
I don't know. Animals are weird. Maybe.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.680
Let's keep going, though. I don't...

30:21.680 --> 30:22.680
Yeah, I didn't see it up there.

30:22.680 --> 30:26.680
I don't care about a councilwoman's dog. Probably the homeless people ate it, right?

30:26.680 --> 30:28.680
Isn't that what she thought?

30:28.680 --> 30:29.680
That's what she thought.

30:29.680 --> 30:32.680
Yeah, that's what I think too. Maybe she should join the force, too.

30:32.680 --> 30:33.680
Were they feeding dogs?

30:33.680 --> 30:34.680
That's ridiculous.

30:34.680 --> 30:35.680
Those homeless people you saw?

30:35.680 --> 30:36.680
Nope.

30:36.680 --> 30:37.680
That seems really prejudice.

30:37.680 --> 30:40.680
I didn't like it when she said it. I don't like it when you say Keith.

30:40.680 --> 30:45.680
Yeah, well, you weren't stuck on a bus full of stinky, scary people.

30:45.680 --> 30:46.680
Who were not eating dogs.

30:46.680 --> 30:47.680
At the time.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.680
You guys pull up to the first church of contention.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.680
It is one of the largest...

30:54.680 --> 30:57.680
It's the fattest fucking building.

30:57.680 --> 30:58.680
It's greasy as hell.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.680
It's some weight, church.

31:00.680 --> 31:05.680
It's one of the largest buildings in contention.

31:05.680 --> 31:14.680
The entirety of the wall facing the street is made of enormous windows with a massive stained glass cross in its center.

31:14.680 --> 31:17.680
The parking lot is the size of a football field.

31:17.680 --> 31:24.680
And an electronic sign displays the time, temperature, and the hours of the different services.

31:24.680 --> 31:27.680
It also currently has a slide that says in all caps,

31:27.680 --> 31:30.680
Free meal for anyone who needs it.

31:30.680 --> 31:31.680
Just come inside.

31:32.680 --> 31:38.680
As you guys park in the parking lot, go ahead and roll an alertness check for me, John.

31:40.680 --> 31:42.680
89 on a 60.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.680
Okay, everything's good to go.

31:44.680 --> 31:45.680
What do you guys want to do?

31:45.680 --> 31:48.680
What temperature is up on that board?

31:48.680 --> 31:50.680
48 degrees.

31:50.680 --> 31:55.680
Okay, that was just a wild stab at the dark at the thing I was supposed to pass my alertness roll for.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.680
I just think we just go in.

31:58.680 --> 32:00.680
Yeah, everything seems fine to me.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.680
Do we know what day it is?

32:02.680 --> 32:04.680
It's December 4th.

32:04.680 --> 32:06.680
Which is what day of the week?

32:06.680 --> 32:07.680
It's Thursday.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.680
We gotta get Ramona out of here.

32:09.680 --> 32:12.680
Ramona wanted out. She was just like, I'm gone. You guys are nerds.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.680
If that fucks up the...

32:15.680 --> 32:18.680
I've never thought about it, but how about this?

32:18.680 --> 32:20.680
That's a good question though, whether it's Sunday or not.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.680
It started on Monday. How about that?

32:22.680 --> 32:25.680
Monday night was when we started, and so Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.680
It's Thursday at noon.

32:27.680 --> 32:28.680
Let's just go in.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.680
There's no reason to call and ask.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.680
We're here to confiscate a piece of evidence.

32:33.680 --> 32:35.680
So yeah, that's what we're here for.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.680
And it's a church. There's no way that they're gonna be...

32:37.680 --> 32:39.680
How full is the parking lot?

32:39.680 --> 32:42.680
There are a handful of cars in the parking lot.

32:42.680 --> 32:46.680
There is also a motorcycle.

32:46.680 --> 32:50.680
I'm gonna stay in the parking lot just in case.

32:50.680 --> 32:54.680
Do you think I ought to stay behind just in case somebody tries to run outside or something?

32:54.680 --> 32:56.680
I don't know why they would though.

32:56.680 --> 32:59.680
Yeah, why don't you stay here and watch the cruisers?

32:59.680 --> 33:00.680
Yeah, I will.

33:00.680 --> 33:03.680
I'll sit in the cruiser and listen to NPR.

33:03.680 --> 33:07.680
Actually, no. Keith would listen to the classic rock station.

33:09.680 --> 33:10.680
Rock.

33:13.680 --> 33:15.680
All right, Luke, leave.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.680
Actually, it's the Doobie Brothers.

33:17.680 --> 33:18.680
Oh, I have to leave?

33:18.680 --> 33:19.680
I mean...

33:19.680 --> 33:20.680
Or just come in with us.

33:20.680 --> 33:23.680
Yeah, I'll go in. I don't wanna say that.

33:24.680 --> 33:26.680
You know what? That's kind of realistic.

33:26.680 --> 33:29.680
You don't wanna miss out on whatever's going on inside.

33:29.680 --> 33:30.680
Yeah, go in with them.

33:30.680 --> 33:34.680
Okay, cool. So when you guys walk through the front doors, the church is mostly empty.

33:34.680 --> 33:38.680
But you can hear a rumble of noise coming from down the stairs.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.680
Hey, do any of us go to this church?

33:40.680 --> 33:42.680
I am not a religious man.

33:42.680 --> 33:44.680
I don't think Clark is.

33:44.680 --> 33:45.680
Maybe when he was a kid.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.680
Yeah, I went here when I was a kid.

33:47.680 --> 33:48.680
I think we probably all did.

33:48.680 --> 33:51.680
So we know the layout of the church. We just haven't been in a while.

33:51.680 --> 33:56.680
But we probably would have some relationship with the pastor as the only three cops in town, for sure.

33:56.680 --> 33:58.680
Yeah, do we know just the pastor's name?

33:58.680 --> 34:00.680
Yeah, his name is Adam Cain.

34:00.680 --> 34:01.680
Adam Cain.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.680
We probably do security for church events and shit.

34:03.680 --> 34:07.680
Would I know where Pastor Cain's office is? Or is there maybe signage that would tell me?

34:07.680 --> 34:10.680
Yeah, you could pretty easily find the offices.

34:10.680 --> 34:16.680
I walk in and I unload my full clip screaming for Pastor Cain.

34:18.680 --> 34:19.680
Yeah, I wanna go back into the offices.

34:19.680 --> 34:20.680
Yeah, we'll follow him.

34:20.680 --> 34:28.680
Okay, cool. Yeah, there is a door that says Head Pastor Adam Cain.

34:28.680 --> 34:30.680
And the door is locked.

34:30.680 --> 34:31.680
I knock on it.

34:32.680 --> 34:38.680
Pastor, it's Clark here. Officer Bishop, we gotta talk to you.

34:39.680 --> 34:40.680
I knock again.

34:40.680 --> 34:41.680
You hear no response.

34:41.680 --> 34:44.680
I'm gonna use my lock picking skill to pick the lock.

34:44.680 --> 34:46.680
Keith pulls out his lock picks.

34:46.680 --> 34:47.680
Wait, wait, wait.

34:47.680 --> 34:54.680
While he does that, I go and try to find an administrative assistant or anybody who works here to ask where somebody is.

34:54.680 --> 34:56.680
I did it already though. I got an 18 on a 50.

34:58.680 --> 35:04.680
John, as you turn around to start walking through the church, you hear a click and the door opens.

35:04.680 --> 35:08.680
I'm still gonna do what I was gonna do because we need to find the pastor.

35:09.680 --> 35:11.680
The door clicks open. I immediately go inside.

35:11.680 --> 35:12.680
Okay.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.680
So, Clark, what are you doing?

35:15.680 --> 35:18.680
I don't know. I think I'd probably peek in the door behind Keith.

35:18.680 --> 35:20.680
Keith, what are you doing? Get out of there.

35:20.680 --> 35:21.680
Dude.

35:21.680 --> 35:22.680
It was locked.

35:22.680 --> 35:23.680
I know. There's not any more.

35:23.680 --> 35:25.680
Do you see the helmet in there?

35:25.680 --> 35:30.680
I walk into the room and sitting on top of the, hold on.

35:31.680 --> 35:37.680
John, you go walking through the church and you actually don't see anyone in the office.

35:37.680 --> 35:43.680
There's a desk for a secretary, but she is or he is not sitting at the desk.

35:43.680 --> 35:49.680
But you do hear that noise coming from, there's a large stairwell that goes downstairs.

35:49.680 --> 35:50.680
And it sounds like there's-

35:50.680 --> 35:53.680
And the lights are on down there and you can hear noise coming from down there.

35:53.680 --> 35:54.680
I'm heading down there.

35:54.680 --> 35:55.680
Sounds good.

35:55.680 --> 36:06.680
Back in the office, Keith, you see sitting on the desk of the pastor, there is an old motorcycle helmet.

36:06.680 --> 36:11.680
And it has some tubes on either side of it.

36:11.680 --> 36:18.680
And there are two lights on it, one green, one red, and the red one is lit up.

36:18.680 --> 36:22.680
I look at Clark and I go, yeah, baby.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.680
And then I grab it.

36:23.680 --> 36:24.680
No.

36:24.680 --> 36:30.680
I grab it. I don't put it on, but I grab it and I am going to go outside and look at that motorcycle.

36:30.680 --> 36:32.680
Wait, so when he grabbed it, did anything happen?

36:32.680 --> 36:36.680
When you grabbed it, nothing happened, but then you turn around and Clark is-

36:36.680 --> 36:43.680
Keith, we got one of these fucking radio, like switch people's bodies when, I assume when they touch it or something.

36:43.680 --> 36:55.680
It's in my, I'm looking at you, like realizing that as you tell me it and it's in my hand, like, well, I just won't put it on, but it seems okay now.

36:55.680 --> 36:58.680
The red lights on, remember the green lights, the one that-

36:58.680 --> 36:59.680
Scary stuff happens.

36:59.680 --> 37:00.680
Scary stuff happens.

37:00.680 --> 37:07.680
Clark, Luke, Keith, do either one of you have microelectronics or-

37:07.680 --> 37:09.680
I have computer science.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.680
Microelectronics is not a thing.

37:12.680 --> 37:13.680
Oh, it's not.

37:13.680 --> 37:15.680
You don't have a craft skill or anything?

37:15.680 --> 37:16.680
My craft is lock picking.

37:16.680 --> 37:17.680
Okay.

37:17.680 --> 37:18.680
I have 20 in computer science.

37:18.680 --> 37:21.680
I've got a 50 in forensics.

37:21.680 --> 37:22.680
Okay.

37:22.680 --> 37:23.680
Then, yeah.

37:23.680 --> 37:24.680
You guys are good?

37:24.680 --> 37:26.680
Yeah, I don't have anything else that could even close.

37:27.680 --> 37:31.680
Actually, instead of going out to check the motorcycle out-

37:31.680 --> 37:32.680
Let's go find John.

37:32.680 --> 37:33.680
Yeah, let's go see where John went.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.680
I got the helmet and I'm carrying it like under my arm.

37:36.680 --> 37:37.680
Sounds good.

37:37.680 --> 37:41.680
John, you head down the stairs.

37:41.680 --> 37:50.680
As you go down there, you see there's an extremely large room at the base of the stairs and there are a bunch of tables set up.

37:50.680 --> 37:54.680
There is a long line of people.

37:54.680 --> 38:04.680
Each person in line kind of looks down on their luck and the line leads to a serving window where there are a few people scooping pasta and salad onto paper plates.

38:04.680 --> 38:14.680
And just past the food is Pastor Adam Cain and he is praying with each person who goes through the line when they grab their food.

38:14.680 --> 38:19.680
He's doing a quick prayer with them and then they head to a table and start chowing down.

38:19.680 --> 38:23.680
I take that all in and I stroll on up to the pastor.

38:23.680 --> 38:25.680
You stroll up to the pastor, Adam Cain.

38:25.680 --> 38:28.680
Adam Cain has a balloon-shaped head.

38:28.680 --> 38:35.680
He has eyes that are so dark that the irises look black and he seems to be in his early 30s.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.680
He is quite smooth and steady.

38:38.680 --> 38:48.680
Everything he does seems to be deliberate and he's praying with each person who comes through and in between two people, you walk right up to him.

38:48.680 --> 38:49.680
Good afternoon, pastor.

38:49.680 --> 38:51.680
Oh, hello, officer.

38:51.680 --> 38:54.680
What are y'all putting on today?

38:54.680 --> 38:56.680
I mean, nothing in particular.

38:56.680 --> 39:02.680
We're just doing our daily lunch service for anyone who is in need of a free meal.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.680
Real quick, off out of character.

39:05.680 --> 39:10.680
The homeless reports we had gotten, right, were about the homeless disappearing, right?

39:10.680 --> 39:12.680
Or they were about the being a bunch of homeless?

39:12.680 --> 39:14.680
An influx of homeless.

39:14.680 --> 39:15.680
An influx of homeless.

39:15.680 --> 39:19.680
You might be able to shed some light on something for me.

39:19.680 --> 39:25.680
We've been hearing about an awful lot of homeless people coming into contention and you pray with these people.

39:25.680 --> 39:26.680
You minister to them.

39:26.680 --> 39:28.680
Have they been telling you where they're coming from?

39:28.680 --> 39:30.680
What troubles have brought them here?

39:30.680 --> 39:38.680
It seems to me that all of these new sheep into the herd of God's kingdom have come from the city.

39:38.680 --> 39:43.680
They all are down on their luck and I am here to feed them.

39:43.680 --> 39:45.680
Well, that's very Christian of you, pastor.

39:45.680 --> 39:48.680
I do what I think is the right thing.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.680
Hey, you know, the reason I'm here today.

39:50.680 --> 39:53.680
We've been dealing with some things going on in this town.

39:53.680 --> 39:55.680
Some stuff is coming together.

39:55.680 --> 40:04.680
We had a pretty important ongoing investigation and unfortunately, eh, this is gonna just sound strange, but...

40:04.680 --> 40:11.680
To the right of you, there are a lot of homeless people piling up who each have their plates waiting for a prayer with Pastor Adam Cain.

40:11.680 --> 40:17.680
Um, I kinda, I am like sideways and I'm like, alright, alright, give me a minute with the pastor.

40:17.680 --> 40:20.680
Ain't got a fucking monopoly on salvation, you homeless fucks.

40:23.680 --> 40:24.680
I say that all into my breath.

40:24.680 --> 40:25.680
Sorry, pastor.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.680
Here's the long and short of it.

40:27.680 --> 40:33.680
We heard that the church had purchased a helmet from a flea market, a motorcycle helmet.

40:33.680 --> 40:39.680
That is unfortunately related to an investigation we are conducting right now.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.680
Should have never been on sale. Let's just put it that way.

40:41.680 --> 40:44.680
So we're gonna need to take that in for evidence if y'all still have it.

40:44.680 --> 40:49.680
Uh, yes. It's actually up in my office right now.

40:49.680 --> 40:54.680
I know you got a whole lot of praying and blessing to do, but would you mind taking me up there right now?

40:54.680 --> 40:55.680
Absolutely not.

40:55.680 --> 41:01.680
Everyone, I'm so sorry. I will be back in a flickscrow of a switch.

41:01.680 --> 41:02.680
Y'all, y'all stay blessed now.

41:02.680 --> 41:09.680
And the two of you begin walking up to the stairs right as Keith and Clark come walking down the stairs,

41:09.680 --> 41:13.680
Keith holding the helmet underneath one of his arms.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.680
And as you all approach each other...

41:16.680 --> 41:19.680
Hey, I found the pastor. He's gonna let us in to his office.

41:20.680 --> 41:21.680
Why?

41:24.680 --> 41:29.680
Oh, uh, pastor, your office was open back there. We found the helmet we needed.

41:29.680 --> 41:35.680
Yeah, the door was wide open and I saw the helmet and I figured, you know, I might as well grab it now,

41:35.680 --> 41:41.680
um, save you the trouble from having to go back up there and then we'd come tell you that we got it and head on our way.

41:41.680 --> 41:46.680
Yeah, pastor, that's all proper procedure and not Vigna being reckless.

41:46.680 --> 41:47.680
Yeah, I mean...

41:47.680 --> 41:48.680
That's correct. That's...

41:48.680 --> 41:50.680
There's no reason for you to, yeah.

41:50.680 --> 41:54.680
Uh, Keith, if you could roll persuade for me against his humit.

41:56.680 --> 41:57.680
Oh.

41:57.680 --> 41:58.680
Fuck.

41:58.680 --> 42:00.680
Oh, fuck no.

42:00.680 --> 42:01.680
That's a hundow.

42:01.680 --> 42:04.680
He rolled a hundred. The worst of the worst.

42:04.680 --> 42:11.680
You rolled a hundred and the pastor passed his check and he looks at you and he says,

42:11.680 --> 42:20.680
That's quite alright. I'm always willing to comply with anything that the enforcers of the law of this great country can do for us.

42:20.680 --> 42:22.680
So is that all you need?

42:22.680 --> 42:24.680
What attracted you to the helmet?

42:24.680 --> 42:25.680
Why'd you buy that?

42:25.680 --> 42:26.680
What kind of food?

42:26.680 --> 42:27.680
What am I smelling down there?

42:28.680 --> 42:32.680
Look, you can just go look at that. We're trying to ask real questions. It's pasta, you eat.

42:32.680 --> 42:36.680
He's right, okay. I'm gonna kind of squeeze past everybody. I'm super embarrassed.

42:36.680 --> 42:40.680
Uh, squeeze past everybody, go grab a plate of whatever's down there.

42:40.680 --> 42:44.680
I'm sticking with John and the pastor. Keith, are you holding on to the helmet as you...

42:44.680 --> 42:45.680
Oh, yeah, definitely.

42:45.680 --> 42:53.680
Yep, so as you pass through, Pastor Adam Kane kind of looks at John and Clark. Was there anything else?

42:53.680 --> 42:55.680
Yeah, I just asked you a question.

42:55.680 --> 43:00.680
Oh, I'm sorry. I was taken aback by Officer Vigna's actions.

43:00.680 --> 43:03.680
He hadn't eaten for like 30 minutes, so he was...

43:03.680 --> 43:04.680
He only had his daily flow.

43:04.680 --> 43:07.680
Well, he's gotta fit into those pants somehow, I suppose.

43:07.680 --> 43:09.680
He's trying, you know. He's trying.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.680
So what was the question that you asked me?

43:11.680 --> 43:12.680
Why did you purchase that helmet?

43:12.680 --> 43:19.680
Oh, I was in the market for a helmet after I decided to go out and buy a motorcycle.

43:19.680 --> 43:20.680
Have you ever ridden one?

43:20.680 --> 43:21.680
Oh, is that your bike out there?

43:21.680 --> 43:22.680
Yes.

43:22.680 --> 43:24.680
I'm acquainted with speed, Pastor.

43:24.680 --> 43:27.680
Is it not just the most exhilarating?

43:27.680 --> 43:28.680
Heavenly.

43:28.680 --> 43:29.680
It's wonderful.

43:29.680 --> 43:32.680
I find them dangerous and reckless, but to each their own.

43:32.680 --> 43:36.680
I appreciate that, but when you have God on your side, nothing is reckless.

43:36.680 --> 43:39.680
And you got a helmet. Well, you don't have a helmet anymore, but...

43:39.680 --> 43:43.680
I did have a helmet, and you said you will be taking that?

43:43.680 --> 43:49.680
We are gonna have to take a little bit of a look at it. You should get it back in 12 to 32 weeks.

43:49.680 --> 43:53.680
Oh, gosh, I really thought you were gonna say hours. Okay, I will...

43:53.680 --> 43:54.680
You should buy a new helmet.

43:54.680 --> 43:57.680
Then I suppose I am once again in the market for a helmet.

43:57.680 --> 44:01.680
Hey, I hate to do this to you, but we see you riding without one.

44:01.680 --> 44:05.680
We are gonna have to give you a ticket, so you should probably get that taken care of immediately.

44:05.680 --> 44:06.680
Well, I will indeed.

44:06.680 --> 44:12.680
I'll have you know that I am working on legislation to have that particular law removed.

44:12.680 --> 44:17.680
There's nothing like riding a motorcycle with the wind in your hair, am I right, John?

44:17.680 --> 44:19.680
Sorry, Officer Pettymore.

44:19.680 --> 44:20.680
Thank you, Pastor.

44:20.680 --> 44:23.680
Thank you, Pastor. Now, I have to say I disagree there.

44:23.680 --> 44:27.680
You know, Clark's right, these are dangerous machines.

44:27.680 --> 44:35.680
It frankly seems irresponsible of somebody, you know, who has his own flock to be introducing this kind of legislation to the community.

44:35.680 --> 44:40.680
Well, I certainly don't believe that there's anything un-Christian about such legislation.

44:40.680 --> 44:44.680
Oh, well. Feels like you'd be leading directly to deaths. I don't know.

44:44.680 --> 44:48.680
Pastor, you think that people shouldn't wear helmets on motorcycles?

44:48.680 --> 44:50.680
That is my goal, yes.

44:50.680 --> 44:57.680
Hell, man, that makes you the coolest pastor I know, but that is not responsible.

44:57.680 --> 44:58.680
To each their own, I suppose.

44:58.680 --> 45:00.680
That seems like the definition of reckless.

45:00.680 --> 45:07.680
Yeah, your recklessness is gonna lead to a lot of wrecks, and folks is gonna be cracking their heads open, because they ain't got no helmet.

45:07.680 --> 45:13.680
I personally don't understand the correlation between a lack of helmet and an influx of wrecks.

45:13.680 --> 45:15.680
We're talking about the severity of the accident?

45:15.680 --> 45:18.680
Okay, I'm sorry. I misunderstood you then, I suppose.

45:18.680 --> 45:28.680
Pastor, I just gotta advise you completely against submitting this, like, this doesn't seem like it would be good for your reputation, for the advancement of our plot in particular, or...

45:28.680 --> 45:30.680
To each their own, I suppose.

45:30.680 --> 45:33.680
That's not the law yet, so you do need that helmet.

45:33.680 --> 45:41.680
Absolutely. I guess I'm in the market again, and I tend to buy used, so I will be back at Forgotten Treasures soon, I suppose.

45:42.680 --> 45:48.680
Okay, also though, you should definitely get a new one, because they don't last if they've been in a crash or something.

45:48.680 --> 45:52.680
Well, I always get my helmet facts on all the used helmets that I buy.

45:52.680 --> 45:57.680
What did the helmet facts say on this one? I guess you could just tell the tubes weren't broken, so that's a good...

45:57.680 --> 46:00.680
There's glass on the outside of it, so I assume...

46:00.680 --> 46:02.680
It's like a rudimentary quality assurance.

46:02.680 --> 46:10.680
Absolutely. I thought it was quite clever of the original makers, although I didn't find a name on it, interestingly enough.

46:10.680 --> 46:12.680
Have you seen what these lights do?

46:12.680 --> 46:14.680
I'm sorry, lights?

46:14.680 --> 46:16.680
Yeah, the red and green light.

46:16.680 --> 46:17.680
Oh, yeah, it's just...

46:17.680 --> 46:19.680
You ever seen that green light come on?

46:19.680 --> 46:20.680
No, it's just been red.

46:20.680 --> 46:21.680
Okay.

46:21.680 --> 46:23.680
How many times have you used the helmet since you bought it?

46:23.680 --> 46:27.680
I picked up the motorcycle, and I rode it here.

46:27.680 --> 46:28.680
So once?

46:28.680 --> 46:29.680
I suppose so, yes.

46:29.680 --> 46:30.680
When was that?

46:30.680 --> 46:36.680
Well, it's, you know, there was, you know, some weather conflicts, and I stayed home one day, and...

46:36.680 --> 46:37.680
Oh, okay.

46:37.680 --> 46:41.680
I've only gotten to ride it once, but it was quite thrilling.

46:41.680 --> 46:46.680
Hey, Pastor, what does the Bible say about animals congregating in funny ways in streams, or creeks?

46:46.680 --> 46:48.680
You have noticed that is...

46:48.680 --> 46:51.680
Well, I have thought that was quite strange.

46:51.680 --> 46:54.680
That's all the spiritual guidance you got for us there that's quite strange?

46:54.680 --> 46:55.680
Well, I've been praying about it.

46:55.680 --> 46:56.680
How long has it been going on?

46:56.680 --> 46:58.680
Oh, a couple days.

46:58.680 --> 46:59.680
They've been out there?

46:59.680 --> 47:03.680
Seems rather odd. Do you see them come and go, or have they just been staying there?

47:03.680 --> 47:06.680
Well, some of them run through the water, and that's always a joy.

47:06.680 --> 47:11.680
You know, it's not every day that you get to see a mink and a raccoon interact.

47:11.680 --> 47:13.680
Yeah, for sure. No, I mean, thank God for all these creatures.

47:13.680 --> 47:15.680
They give us company and nutrition.

47:15.680 --> 47:19.680
I come back up, I got a plate full of all the...

47:19.680 --> 47:20.680
Pasta and salad.

47:20.680 --> 47:24.680
Pasta and salad that I could fit on there, and I've got a mouthful of food,

47:24.680 --> 47:28.680
but I shoot up and swallow it, and I come up to the pastor, and I say,

47:28.680 --> 47:31.680
Hey, do you know where all these people are staying?

47:31.680 --> 47:33.680
I believe they live in the city.

47:33.680 --> 47:35.680
All these homeless people live in the city?

47:35.680 --> 47:38.680
Well, there are more shelters there than there are here,

47:38.680 --> 47:44.680
and I believe from talking to them, they seem to be moving from shelter to shelter,

47:44.680 --> 47:46.680
depending on which days are available.

47:46.680 --> 47:48.680
Do you know the plight of the homeless well, Keith?

47:48.680 --> 47:50.680
Sorry, Officer Vigna?

47:50.680 --> 47:51.680
Thank you.

47:51.680 --> 47:53.680
I... I just...

47:53.680 --> 47:54.680
I have a...

47:54.680 --> 47:59.680
This might sound like an odd question, but do the pistons attend your congregation?

47:59.680 --> 48:01.680
Yeah...

48:01.680 --> 48:03.680
Well...

48:03.680 --> 48:07.680
I can't say that there are regulars here at the First Church of Contention,

48:07.680 --> 48:10.680
though I do see George and Kathy,

48:10.680 --> 48:14.680
and they'll sometimes bring Leo on holidays here and there.

48:14.680 --> 48:16.680
When's the last time you saw them here?

48:16.680 --> 48:17.680
Oh, gosh.

48:17.680 --> 48:20.680
Might have been our Fourth of July celebration, I don't know.

48:20.680 --> 48:21.680
It could have been Easter.

48:21.680 --> 48:22.680
Okay.

48:22.680 --> 48:25.680
Were you aware they might be running a...

48:25.680 --> 48:26.680
A homeless shelter?

48:26.680 --> 48:27.680
Shooting daggers at...

48:27.680 --> 48:29.680
Yeah, we're both shooting daggers at Keith.

48:29.680 --> 48:30.680
With their eyes.

48:30.680 --> 48:31.680
Yeah, I...

48:31.680 --> 48:32.680
No.

48:32.680 --> 48:33.680
I say no.

48:33.680 --> 48:35.680
We're firing daggers out of our service business.

48:35.680 --> 48:37.680
Roll mail.

48:37.680 --> 48:38.680
Yeah, I say...

48:38.680 --> 48:39.680
He's not...

48:39.680 --> 48:40.680
He's running...

48:40.680 --> 48:41.680
Yeah, he's not running.

48:41.680 --> 48:43.680
Did you know that the pistons are running a pig farm?

48:43.680 --> 48:44.680
Well, yes.

48:44.680 --> 48:46.680
That has been their business for some time.

48:46.680 --> 48:47.680
All right.

48:47.680 --> 48:48.680
I just wanted to check.

48:48.680 --> 48:49.680
Hey, Keith...

48:49.680 --> 48:50.680
I'm pulling this.

48:50.680 --> 48:51.680
Keith, what the...

48:51.680 --> 48:54.680
We don't fucking just tell people about facts about the investigation, God dammit.

48:54.680 --> 48:55.680
So, Pastor...

48:55.680 --> 48:58.680
I do need to get back to my flock.

48:58.680 --> 48:59.680
If that's all that you need, then...

48:59.680 --> 49:00.680
Of course.

49:00.680 --> 49:02.680
You got a lot of blessing and praying to do.

49:02.680 --> 49:03.680
I am...

49:03.680 --> 49:05.680
Thank you so much for understanding about the helmet.

49:05.680 --> 49:08.680
Hey, if you remember anything about that, why don't you give us a call?

49:08.680 --> 49:09.680
Here's my card.

49:09.680 --> 49:13.680
Hey, real fast, before you go, did anybody else come asking about this helmet?

49:13.680 --> 49:16.680
You are the first ones I've talked to about it.

49:16.680 --> 49:17.680
All right.

49:17.680 --> 49:18.680
Can I humint that?

49:18.680 --> 49:19.680
Oh, yes, you can.

49:19.680 --> 49:20.680
Roll humint.

49:20.680 --> 49:22.680
93 out of 50.

49:22.680 --> 49:23.680
Fail.

49:23.680 --> 49:24.680
All right.

49:24.680 --> 49:29.040
I take a few more bites of my food and then I go back to the buffet and I scrape the leftovers

49:29.040 --> 49:30.040
back into their...

49:30.040 --> 49:31.040
Oh, my God.

49:31.040 --> 49:32.040
Back into their...

49:32.040 --> 49:34.680
Like the salad, back into the salad, and the pasta, back into the pasta.

49:34.680 --> 49:38.080
How do you think real people...

49:38.080 --> 49:42.680
How do you think your coworkers are actually supposed to react to that?

49:42.680 --> 49:49.680
If you saw somebody do that that you knew, you would hate that person.

49:49.680 --> 49:53.340
Vigna, what the fuck?

49:53.340 --> 49:58.060
Get those trays, throw those out, help the kitchen workers bring some new ones back.

49:58.060 --> 50:00.380
What the hell are you doing in this church?

50:00.380 --> 50:02.340
Do you hate homeless people?

50:02.340 --> 50:03.340
I was just trying to...

50:03.340 --> 50:04.340
I didn't need it anymore.

50:04.340 --> 50:05.340
Vigna.

50:05.340 --> 50:06.340
And they need it more than me.

50:06.340 --> 50:07.340
Let's get out of here.

50:07.340 --> 50:08.520
Vigna, you dumb son of a bitch.

50:08.520 --> 50:15.120
You guys are yelling this weird conversation on one side of the room as Pastor Adam Kane

50:15.120 --> 50:22.420
is just staring daggers into both of you as he circles around and gets to the front of

50:22.420 --> 50:28.180
the group, grabs a microphone, and begins speaking.

50:28.180 --> 50:32.340
Hello everyone, and welcome to the First Church of Contention.

50:32.340 --> 50:35.260
I am the pastor, Adam Kane.

50:35.260 --> 50:36.700
You guys are having this weird conversation.

50:36.700 --> 50:41.420
Clark, I imagine you still standing on the stairs looking into this room.

50:41.420 --> 50:43.060
And the pastor goes on.

50:43.060 --> 50:47.920
We here at FCC believe that every life has a purpose.

50:47.920 --> 50:54.200
No one comes through our doors by accident, and we aim to help alleviate any pain in any

50:54.200 --> 50:57.000
life, in any way possible.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.580
Today that pain may be physical hunger.

51:00.580 --> 51:02.160
We can help with that.

51:02.160 --> 51:05.500
Let's all give a round of applause to our wonderful volunteers from the youth group

51:05.500 --> 51:10.240
serving up the pasta that my beautiful wife Evelyn and our kids David and Sarah have made.

51:10.240 --> 51:11.240
Well done.

51:11.240 --> 51:17.880
Now please enjoy the food and the fellowship, and we hope to see you back with us on Sunday.

51:17.920 --> 51:21.040
So that we may relieve your spiritual pain.

51:21.040 --> 51:24.880
You know, a beautiful afterlife awaits everyone who believes.

51:24.880 --> 51:28.000
It is just on the other side of the veil, and...

51:28.000 --> 51:31.400
Look at me, I'm getting ahead of myself.

51:31.400 --> 51:35.360
Enjoy yourselves, and we'll see you all on Sunday.

51:35.360 --> 51:38.520
And he clicks the mic off and goes back walking through.

51:38.520 --> 51:44.200
In a little bit of time dilation, as he was doing all that, can I scan the crowd?

51:44.200 --> 51:46.600
Is the crowd reacting like a normal crowd would?

51:46.600 --> 51:47.600
Absolutely, yeah, yeah.

51:47.920 --> 51:52.160
Have you ever seen, have you ever been to like a soup kitchen or a church when they're

51:52.160 --> 51:53.880
serving a group of homeless people?

51:53.880 --> 51:55.440
No, I guess not, not homeless people.

51:55.440 --> 51:57.800
I've been to like churches serving dinners, but...

51:57.800 --> 52:00.480
It is weirdly quiet.

52:00.480 --> 52:01.480
So Keith?

52:01.480 --> 52:05.160
Yeah, I head back up the stairs, I'm like, I don't want to be here anymore.

52:05.160 --> 52:09.600
I do want to go look at this guy's bike, just to check it out, because I got this cool helmet.

52:09.600 --> 52:14.680
I've never ridden a motorcycle before, but all of a sudden I feel like, damn, this is cool.

52:14.680 --> 52:15.880
It's a pretty sweet motorcycle.

52:15.880 --> 52:16.880
Is it black?

52:16.880 --> 52:27.120
Yes, and it's pretty, it's got a naked lady on the gas tank.

52:27.120 --> 52:29.920
This pastor's a really cool pastor.

52:29.920 --> 52:33.920
It's Mary Magdalene.

52:33.920 --> 52:35.920
Bathing Jesus's feet.

52:35.920 --> 52:39.080
With her hair, pin-up style Mary.

52:39.080 --> 52:41.040
I would rise up for three days for that.

52:46.880 --> 53:10.960
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the

53:10.960 --> 53:11.960
night?

53:11.960 --> 53:12.960
No, I'm not.

53:12.960 --> 53:12.960
