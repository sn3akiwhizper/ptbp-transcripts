00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
This is yet another introduction from your big boy Wolfie.

00:04.640 --> 00:07.320
Hello to anyone out there that is listening.

00:07.320 --> 00:12.320
I'm Glistening, live here from 694.2 PTBP.

00:13.200 --> 00:17.160
Recorded live in front of a studio audience.

00:17.160 --> 00:22.160
And live in front of my producer, at least.

00:22.480 --> 00:26.040
Producer don't seem to talk too much these days, though.

00:26.040 --> 00:29.320
Speaking of my possibly deceased producer,

00:29.320 --> 00:32.200
we got a new Howlin' with Wolf this week.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.440
Who's delivering these to me?

00:34.440 --> 00:38.200
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Big Danny Dan Dan,

00:38.200 --> 00:41.800
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

00:41.800 --> 00:45.600
which is a top notch internet move in my opinion.

00:45.600 --> 00:46.720
They right.

00:46.720 --> 00:49.760
Hey friends, just wanted to say thank you so much

00:49.760 --> 00:52.380
for the great work you put into this pod.

00:52.380 --> 00:55.440
It has brought me an immense amount of joy and comfort.

00:55.440 --> 00:59.480
Zach, your world building and storytelling is top class.

00:59.480 --> 01:03.320
Justin, your music is absolutely on point.

01:03.320 --> 01:07.920
And to our dear PCs, your characters always managed

01:07.920 --> 01:12.920
to accentuate the absurdity that is human nature just right.

01:12.920 --> 01:16.120
PS, to everyone, winter is coming.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.960
Love each other and remember your vitamin D.

01:18.960 --> 01:23.040
Also to whom it may concern, your tea is getting cold.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.000
Love, Big Danny Dan Dan.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.320
Well hello, Big Danny Dan Dan.

01:29.320 --> 01:32.080
The only pod I know about is the ones

01:32.080 --> 01:34.720
from which my spawn will hatch out of.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.180
Millions of tiny baby wolves, many limbed

01:38.180 --> 01:42.960
and frothing at the mouth, hungry for father's special maulk.

01:42.960 --> 01:46.000
They will probably devour us all rather quickly

01:46.000 --> 01:48.120
when the birthing concludes.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.160
But as I posted on my dating app profile,

01:51.160 --> 01:55.040
I'm here for a good time, not a long time.

01:55.040 --> 01:58.940
But also, what the fuck is time anyway?

01:58.940 --> 02:03.200
If you want to howl at your wolf, tag us on the internet

02:03.200 --> 02:06.440
or write a five star review and shoot us an email.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.840
All the links are in the show notes.

02:08.840 --> 02:12.040
It takes like two minutes tops, fuck.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.640
And if you're sitting on the toilet

02:13.640 --> 02:15.880
or trapped by a sleeping pet right now,

02:15.880 --> 02:18.560
you have absolutely no excuses.

02:18.560 --> 02:19.480
Get on it.

02:19.480 --> 02:23.640
Wolf can and will wait, but only like barely

02:23.640 --> 02:25.760
because it's time to get scary.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.200
I don't want to be gruff or forward,

02:28.200 --> 02:31.320
but I would do weird stuff to scot doorward.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.040
Those who would love to are not alone.

02:34.040 --> 02:37.400
It's time for kudzu with no backbone.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.440
THEME SONG

02:39.440 --> 03:09.280
So, you're there at the doorway of what you

03:09.280 --> 03:12.520
presume is Astin Hawkes' laboratory.

03:12.920 --> 03:17.240
It is dark inside, there is that sound of

03:17.240 --> 03:21.120
something perhaps moving in liquid towards the

03:21.120 --> 03:24.960
back. There are indistinct shapes in the gloom,

03:24.960 --> 03:27.600
but there really isn't enough light to work out

03:27.600 --> 03:28.800
what anything is.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.080
Do you guys want me to run away and tear again,

03:32.440 --> 03:34.320
just in case you want to recheck your pockets

03:34.320 --> 03:36.160
with another luck roll for those flashlights?

03:39.280 --> 03:45.960
No, but Frederick Mellon is a seasoned burglar

03:46.360 --> 03:50.160
and has worked in the dark many, many times and

03:50.160 --> 03:56.720
has learned to rely on his keen sense of ears as

03:56.720 --> 03:58.160
well as smell.

03:59.040 --> 04:04.680
And so he is going to try to really dig past his

04:04.680 --> 04:09.440
inability to see, to make out anything else

04:09.440 --> 04:10.600
that's going on in this room.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.400
Yeah, give us a daredevil roll.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.520
Carl's going to check his pockets to see if he

04:14.520 --> 04:15.560
has a lighter in there.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.160
OK, well, give me a luck roll.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.840
Seven on a 20.

04:21.280 --> 04:24.600
You do have your trusty old Zippo in there.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.520
I see Frederick making some weird faces, like

04:27.960 --> 04:31.360
sniffing around and trying to hear, and I flip

04:31.360 --> 04:33.600
that on like this, this might help.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.600
I passed my listen roll, so I hear the lighter.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.560
But also, yeah, that listen roll does help you

04:43.560 --> 04:45.880
identify where that sound is coming from.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.840
And sure enough, as you've got a bit of light in

04:48.840 --> 04:51.320
there and it's a lighter, so it's not lighting up

04:51.320 --> 04:54.520
the whole room, but as Dr.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.320
Rothstein mixes way in a bit, you can make out

04:57.320 --> 04:59.920
details and you can see a glint at the back of

04:59.920 --> 05:04.880
glass and metal, and you reckon the sound you

05:04.880 --> 05:07.160
heard of something moving in liquid came from

05:07.160 --> 05:10.320
back there. And in the little bit of light you

05:10.320 --> 05:14.040
have, it looks, well, maybe not quite like a fish

05:14.040 --> 05:17.360
tank, but certainly, you know, there's more metal

05:17.360 --> 05:18.800
on it than a fish tank.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.920
But there's glass windows and it definitely looks

05:21.920 --> 05:23.920
like some kind of large tank that's holding

05:23.920 --> 05:26.280
liquid. But you can also make out that there are

05:26.280 --> 05:29.480
a number of workbenches that have got all sorts

05:29.480 --> 05:31.200
of equipment on them, including more of these

05:31.200 --> 05:36.760
cylinders and forceps and gloves and aprons and

05:36.760 --> 05:37.640
stuff like that.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.960
Frederick Mellon will grab a pair of forceps.

05:40.280 --> 05:40.600
Good.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.680
Yeah, we should stock up on all of those, all

05:43.680 --> 05:47.760
those things. A forcep and a canister for every

05:47.760 --> 05:52.800
man. Do we see any light fixtures?

05:53.360 --> 05:55.760
Yeah, there are a number of light fixtures.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.960
There is also something that looks like an

05:59.960 --> 06:02.160
electrical wiring loom with all sorts of

06:02.160 --> 06:05.680
equipment. And yeah, you're not quite sure

06:05.680 --> 06:07.720
initially what it is, or maybe with a bit of

06:07.720 --> 06:08.320
time, Dr.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.800
Rothstein could work it out.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.960
But what looks like some fairly complicated

06:12.960 --> 06:16.040
electronics just covering an entire part of the

06:16.040 --> 06:17.480
wall on this loom.

06:18.280 --> 06:21.480
And there is a bigger knife switch that's there

06:21.480 --> 06:22.840
and a few controls.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.480
The other thing that attracts your attention is

06:26.480 --> 06:31.000
the floor. The floor is flag stoned, but there is

06:31.520 --> 06:35.840
this big ring of metal of some kind, maybe

06:35.840 --> 06:38.200
copper, that seems to have all these strange

06:38.200 --> 06:42.960
carvings and designs in it that is connected up

06:42.960 --> 06:46.440
somehow to this electrical loom.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.280
Are the workbenches all outside of that?

06:49.480 --> 06:49.880
Yes.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.480
Or does it kind of run around the room

06:51.480 --> 06:52.080
indiscriminately?

06:52.400 --> 06:55.600
No, it's a circle that's within the center of

06:55.600 --> 06:57.760
the room. All the other equipment, everything

06:57.760 --> 07:00.240
else is outside that circle.

07:00.320 --> 07:00.840
Cool, yeah.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.360
Hey, Luke, what's Karl Rothstein's electrical

07:03.520 --> 07:03.960
repair?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
60%.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.240
Dope. I was hoping it was higher than mine

07:07.240 --> 07:09.200
because I actually pulled 50 in it because I

07:09.200 --> 07:12.360
thought Frederick Mellon might have cut

07:12.360 --> 07:15.920
people's power when he went to rob them, you

07:15.920 --> 07:18.800
know, gotten adept at handling that kind of

07:18.800 --> 07:20.720
stuff. But then I was like, Oh, no, what if I

07:20.720 --> 07:23.040
put my electrical repair higher than the

07:23.160 --> 07:23.680
physicist?

07:25.600 --> 07:26.080
Did you?

07:27.360 --> 07:27.680
No.

07:27.720 --> 07:29.760
This copper circle, is there anything on the

07:29.760 --> 07:30.840
ceiling directly above it?

07:30.960 --> 07:32.200
No, it's just on the floor.

07:32.440 --> 07:33.040
Good question.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.000
But Dr.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.560
Rothstein in particular can work out fairly

07:37.560 --> 07:42.600
quickly, I guess, that there is no power source

07:42.600 --> 07:45.960
in this room. But obviously, you saw those

07:45.960 --> 07:48.600
cables going off to the other outbuildings.

07:49.080 --> 07:52.800
And, you know, it probably makes sense to you

07:52.800 --> 07:55.200
that those must be external generators.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.360
Rothstein, we heard about some kind of portal.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.000
Do you think this here is that?

08:01.200 --> 08:04.200
I mean, if anything was a portal, that would be

08:04.200 --> 08:06.800
it. Don't you believe?

08:08.120 --> 08:09.280
It is very portally.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.160
I mean, when you think of portal, you think of

08:12.160 --> 08:12.920
that, don't you?

08:13.160 --> 08:17.200
I don't have a great sci-fi horror frame of

08:17.200 --> 08:19.560
reference at this point in history.

08:21.880 --> 08:25.400
You know, this might not be science fiction.

08:25.480 --> 08:26.760
This is real life.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.480
So I didn't know.

08:29.040 --> 08:32.200
I just the answer to my question is, yes, it

08:32.200 --> 08:33.160
looks like a portal.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.240
I think it is.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.320
Frederick Mellon is like standing in the middle

08:36.320 --> 08:39.960
of it and he's like, oh, this jumps out of the

08:39.960 --> 08:41.880
middle of the circle back on the other side.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.600
I believe those there might be generators on

08:44.600 --> 08:48.360
the outside. Should we try to turn the power on?

08:49.120 --> 08:50.800
No, absolutely not.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.160
We should try to destroy the generators.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.480
That way the power can't ever be turned on unless

08:56.480 --> 08:58.160
we're trying to send these things back.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.160
I thought we were going to send them back.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.280
No, I think we just light them on fire.

09:02.680 --> 09:05.000
Oh, sending them back would be much more fun.

09:05.480 --> 09:07.840
While this conversation is going on, Nathaniel

09:07.840 --> 09:11.000
wants to walk back further toward the tank and

09:11.000 --> 09:12.400
inspect it a little closer.

09:12.440 --> 09:15.880
OK, well, you're obviously now moving outside

09:15.880 --> 09:18.400
the penumbra of Rothstein's Lighters, so it's

09:18.400 --> 09:23.200
fairly dark. But yeah, you get back there and

09:23.840 --> 09:27.480
yeah, there is some kind of dark liquid, probably

09:27.480 --> 09:30.680
water, maybe not, inside this tank.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.320
And in the little bit of light you have, you can

09:34.320 --> 09:38.440
just make out shapes moving within it, including

09:38.440 --> 09:39.960
one fairly large one.

09:40.440 --> 09:43.160
Are the shapes roughly like the bugs I've seen

09:43.160 --> 09:46.440
before, or is it a wholly new thing to me?

09:46.560 --> 09:48.280
There's...

09:48.600 --> 09:52.040
Well, give me a spot hidden as you're doing this

09:52.040 --> 09:54.360
in the gloom.

09:57.040 --> 10:00.680
I pass a 7 on a 25.

10:00.680 --> 10:01.160
25.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.520
So, yeah, you can see that a few of the things

10:04.520 --> 10:08.160
that wriggle past do look like the specimens

10:08.200 --> 10:12.560
that you saw earlier, albeit larger versions.

10:13.120 --> 10:15.560
But there is something in that tank as well.

10:15.560 --> 10:18.000
You can't really make out the details a bit, but

10:18.000 --> 10:21.400
from the size and shape of it, it looks...

10:22.240 --> 10:26.080
No, it looks very, very different, paler and

10:26.080 --> 10:30.040
larger. And there are tendrils coming off it.

10:33.320 --> 10:37.160
I turn around and announce to the guys, it looks

10:37.200 --> 10:40.400
like maybe they keep them here swimming around

10:40.400 --> 10:42.880
or something. There's another one.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.000
There's another thing in there.

10:45.200 --> 10:49.400
I don't know if it's like insects in our world.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.080
It's maybe it's queen or something.

10:52.080 --> 10:55.160
As he's pointing behind him, Thomas Dolan

10:55.160 --> 10:58.160
dramatically flips on the lights and nothing

10:58.160 --> 10:58.640
happens.

11:00.800 --> 11:01.480
Fuck.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.080
All right, well, I lost rock, paper, scissors, so

11:07.080 --> 11:08.840
we're going to try to turn this thing on and

11:08.840 --> 11:10.840
send these things back to where they came from.

11:10.840 --> 11:14.280
So I guess we get ready to push over the tank

11:14.280 --> 11:17.800
into the big old copper circle and then two of

11:17.800 --> 11:20.040
us go to the generator rooms, flip on the

11:20.040 --> 11:24.720
switches on the count of 50 and then, you know,

11:24.720 --> 11:27.680
the two left inside here push over the fish tank

11:27.680 --> 11:30.520
into the into the circle and then we'll turn it

11:30.520 --> 11:31.120
back off.

11:31.400 --> 11:31.880
Sure.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.600
I have no objections to this plan.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.920
I think it's an OK plan.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.760
We don't know a lot about this portal.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.520
We could turn it on and they come flooding out

11:39.520 --> 11:40.160
at us.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.920
I don't know if it's how it works.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.080
I think it's worth a shot.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.960
That's let's push that tank over.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.280
I'm too weak to do it.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.800
So I have to be one of the ones working in the

11:48.800 --> 11:51.640
electric city, which I have some experience with.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.400
So if they do come flooding out, that's a risk

11:54.400 --> 11:55.200
I'm willing to take.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.320
Rothstein, let's go.

11:56.880 --> 11:57.360
Sweet.

11:57.360 --> 11:57.880
Perfect.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.640
Coombs, do you think you can push this tank over

12:00.640 --> 12:01.200
on your own?

12:03.920 --> 12:04.600
I don't know.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.240
I'm not there.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.160
I just figured instead of counting to 50, I could

12:10.160 --> 12:11.920
I could be somewhere in the middle and I could let

12:11.920 --> 12:14.600
out a note on my fiddle and everybody works

12:14.600 --> 12:15.720
together at the same time.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.120
Five, six, seven, eight.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.120
But I could also be there standing by the tank

12:24.120 --> 12:24.600
with you.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.440
Well, we'll know when the lights come on.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.200
I guess that they did their part and then we tip

12:28.200 --> 12:28.880
the tank over.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.800
We could even have once they get the generators

12:30.800 --> 12:33.160
going, they could just join us back in here.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.600
We still got to flip a switch on the machine, right?

12:35.920 --> 12:38.480
Oh, we want to be ready to turn off the generators,

12:38.480 --> 12:38.840
right?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.160
We just turn the flip the switch back off.

12:41.280 --> 12:41.720
Right.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.800
The portal switch seems to be in here.

12:44.160 --> 12:44.680
Okay.

12:45.040 --> 12:48.000
I'm going to stick with this confidence that we

12:48.000 --> 12:51.720
have, that we know what's going on with this and

12:51.720 --> 12:53.640
be like, oh yeah, fuck yeah, dude.

12:53.760 --> 12:54.880
All right, let's go.

12:54.920 --> 12:55.240
What?

12:55.240 --> 12:56.800
Are you think we're going to fuck up and do them

12:56.800 --> 12:57.640
all humanity?

12:57.640 --> 12:58.680
Like, come on.

13:00.120 --> 13:00.760
I doubt it.

13:00.760 --> 13:01.840
Nothing mentioned, nothing gained.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.520
People like us don't have the power to change

13:04.520 --> 13:05.400
human history.

13:05.760 --> 13:08.360
They've told us that over and over our entire

13:08.360 --> 13:09.880
lives, they've let us know.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.880
I mean, my entire life for you guys just recently.

13:12.880 --> 13:17.240
But we're not the ones who are here to, like,

13:17.680 --> 13:18.520
shake up this.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.200
How old are you?

13:19.200 --> 13:20.520
I'm like 27.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.440
I'm 44.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.600
No, my character sheet says old.

13:27.520 --> 13:30.760
So Frederick Mellon I is firing up the generators,

13:30.760 --> 13:31.480
is that right?

13:31.560 --> 13:32.560
At least one of them.

13:32.760 --> 13:33.280
Okay.

13:33.280 --> 13:36.000
And I could do both now that we're not doing it

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
at the same time.

13:37.040 --> 13:37.480
Sure.

13:37.520 --> 13:37.720
Yeah.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.680
It's not like a pressure plate puzzle or anything,

13:39.680 --> 13:40.240
I don't think.

13:42.080 --> 13:42.360
Yeah.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.920
I mean, it doesn't take much to fire up the generators.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.720
You can see that there are a few drums of diesel

13:46.720 --> 13:47.600
there as well.

13:47.640 --> 13:51.440
So, but there seems to be enough fuel in there that

13:51.440 --> 13:55.880
you fire up the generators and then, yeah, the lights

13:55.920 --> 13:59.080
inside the laboratory start flickering on.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.760
It takes a minute for Mellon to come back because

14:01.760 --> 14:05.360
he's going to roll one of those tanks of diesel

14:06.280 --> 14:07.560
back to the lab.

14:07.720 --> 14:08.240
Sure.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.840
Just in case we all need to die in a horrible

14:10.840 --> 14:12.440
conflagration, I get you.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.560
That's exactly right.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.000
Okay.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.520
But for the rest of you, once the lights are on,

14:17.520 --> 14:21.080
you can see much better what's inside here.

14:21.440 --> 14:24.240
As I said, there's fairly complex a wiring loom

14:24.240 --> 14:27.120
with all sorts of weird stuff going on in there.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.880
There are the workbenches with odd bits of equipment.

14:31.280 --> 14:36.480
You also see that there is a journal or at least

14:36.480 --> 14:39.480
a notebook of some kind on the bench as well.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.760
The tank, you get a better idea now.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.040
Pulling it over is going to be difficult because

14:45.040 --> 14:46.880
it is bolted to the stone wall.

14:50.240 --> 14:54.120
The things moving around inside, yeah, most of them

14:54.120 --> 14:59.680
do look like this thing that Caspar Brink had

14:59.680 --> 15:01.680
referred to as species 17.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.360
There's something else, though, this larger thing.

15:07.120 --> 15:09.440
There's something about it that reminds you of a

15:09.440 --> 15:12.840
monkey in the shape of it, but maybe a monkey

15:12.840 --> 15:14.720
that's been turned inside out.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.800
And it's floating there in the water.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.640
Its limbs do look more like tentacles than arms.

15:22.560 --> 15:25.920
It's just floating placidly in the middle of all this.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.360
Let's have a sanity roll off Dr.

15:28.360 --> 15:32.400
Coombs as he was the one taking an interest in the contents of the tank.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.400
Taking an interest in the inside out monkey?

15:39.880 --> 15:43.080
I fail, a 93 on a 32.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.280
OK, so you lose a D4.

15:46.240 --> 15:46.680
One.

15:46.920 --> 15:51.600
OK, but yeah, I think the rest of you here, Dr.

15:51.600 --> 15:56.480
Coombs, just cry out an alarm as the lights come on.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.840
And basically, he's been standing there trying to

15:58.840 --> 16:00.560
stare into this tank and all of a sudden he gets a

16:00.560 --> 16:02.320
really good look at what's on the other side of the

16:02.320 --> 16:05.080
glass and just staggers back and lands heavily on

16:05.080 --> 16:05.720
the ground.

16:08.720 --> 16:09.880
That's such a good shot.

16:10.760 --> 16:11.120
Dr.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.280
Osteen is now in a position to actually get a better

16:14.280 --> 16:15.960
look at some of this equipment.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.960
There's also, like I say, this journal, this

16:20.960 --> 16:25.800
leather-bound volume, at least, that's sitting on the workbench.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.960
What, are we going to read the journal like a bunch of nerds?

16:28.440 --> 16:29.480
Let's just flip the switch.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.240
Luke, I think your mic is off.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.000
OK.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.640
Ah, I thought you were quiet.

16:36.800 --> 16:37.680
That makes more sense.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.880
That's much better.

16:39.600 --> 16:45.160
Rothstein is going to go inspect the switch for what he thinks is the portal.

16:45.480 --> 16:48.200
And then is that book near here, that journal?

16:48.560 --> 16:51.520
Yeah, yeah, it's just by all this wiring loom.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.120
Yeah, I'm going to look around and I see that and I'm

16:54.120 --> 16:58.200
going to open it up and read from the start, see what's in it.

16:58.240 --> 17:02.440
Yeah, I mean, there's too much here for you to read through quickly.

17:02.440 --> 17:06.720
I mean, you can skim it just to try to pick out the pertinent points.

17:07.080 --> 17:10.200
It's written in English, which isn't your first language.

17:10.520 --> 17:13.480
So if you're skimming it and trying to dig out the meaning,

17:13.480 --> 17:15.000
let's have a read English roll.

17:15.200 --> 17:15.760
Off you.

17:17.600 --> 17:20.440
I do not pass a 95 on a 50.

17:20.680 --> 17:21.880
Oh, Luke, your mic's off.

17:21.880 --> 17:24.480
Maybe roll again and tell us where you're at.

17:25.680 --> 17:26.120
Right.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.840
You're skimming through, but it's going to take you a

17:31.840 --> 17:33.960
bit more time to make sense of this.

17:34.800 --> 17:39.840
You could just sort of try to ignore the others around you and just really

17:39.840 --> 17:42.320
focus on digging this and push the roll.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.600
But I mean, you know, there's always the chance that you'll just

17:45.600 --> 17:48.120
catastrophically misunderstand what it's saying.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.200
I'm going to, I'm going to push the roll.

17:51.600 --> 17:55.080
I look over at them and, uh, I'm going to read this.

17:55.080 --> 18:00.520
You got, while you guys work on the fish tank and then I rolled a four.

18:05.080 --> 18:08.440
I mean, I wish you would have failed it, but so do I.

18:08.440 --> 18:12.840
Yeah, the DMs would.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.840
Can we spend luck to fail the roll?

18:16.760 --> 18:18.160
Yeah, I'm going to spend 16 luck.

18:19.040 --> 18:23.040
Zach's like, can I spend my luck to nerf his numbers?

18:26.200 --> 18:29.240
I've got 70, so I can make it a pretty bad fail.

18:30.920 --> 18:35.040
When Frederick Mellon I comes back to the laboratory, obviously Dr.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.240
Rothstein has got his nose in the book.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.760
Dr. Coombes is still sitting there on the ground, looking at the fish tank in terror.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.400
What's Dolan doing?

18:43.480 --> 18:48.080
Dolan is probably pacing around kind of nervously and just trying to pitch in wherever

18:48.080 --> 18:54.960
you can. But I bet his anxiety is like, doc, other doc, are you ready over there?

18:55.640 --> 18:57.320
Are we going to do this? So we're going to, what's going on?

18:58.040 --> 18:58.600
I'm reading.

18:58.600 --> 19:04.200
By the way, the other thing that you've noticed, that Frederick Mellon I has noticed

19:04.200 --> 19:10.120
as he comes back towards the laboratory, is as you've turned the generator on, a few of

19:10.120 --> 19:13.440
the lights, not all of them, but a few of the lights in the main building have come on as

19:13.440 --> 19:13.760
well.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.480
I was wondering about that.

19:15.960 --> 19:20.760
I'm going to do a little roll for him real quick, just to see.

19:21.480 --> 19:24.520
He looks up at the lights and he's really drawn.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
He loves stealing, like from rich people specifically.

19:29.000 --> 19:36.200
And so he really wants to go up there, but better judgment says, ah, okay, let me at least

19:36.200 --> 19:37.400
check in with the boys.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.200
I'm so disappointed in you.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.720
I rolled intelligence and I passed.

19:47.960 --> 19:51.920
But yeah, as I said, then you make your way back to the laboratory and you see all that

19:51.920 --> 19:53.160
other stuff going on.

19:53.240 --> 20:01.000
Can I from the ground now shocked by the creature, but I also, can I notice the bolts and

20:01.000 --> 20:05.480
then we, uh, we gotta, we gotta find a wrench guys that this thing's bolted to the wall.

20:05.520 --> 20:05.840
Okay.

20:05.840 --> 20:06.680
I'll go find one.

20:06.680 --> 20:07.400
I'll be right back.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.120
Well, Freddie, Freddie, hold on.

20:09.160 --> 20:12.440
We, maybe we should pursue other options.

20:13.320 --> 20:14.560
Can't you just break it?

20:14.640 --> 20:14.840
Yeah.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.320
That's, that's what I was going to suggest.

20:16.320 --> 20:21.800
What if we, what if we break it and we create some kind of channel or funnel, uh, directly

20:21.800 --> 20:22.920
into the center of the portal?

20:23.160 --> 20:25.640
You know, just some planks or whatever that run to it.

20:26.040 --> 20:26.920
How big is this room?

20:27.480 --> 20:35.320
Uh, the room is about, yeah, about 10 meters in diameter and it's up against the wall.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.560
The, the ring in the floor is fairly large.

20:38.560 --> 20:42.600
It doesn't take up the whole room by any means, but yeah, I mean, there's still a few

20:42.600 --> 20:45.880
meters between the tank and the, the ring in the ground.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.920
So if it were to tip over, it would tip over into the ring.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.600
Um, or at least just up to the edge of it.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.640
Yeah, perfect.

20:52.680 --> 20:56.120
I'm a little worried about our plan now that we've seen that thing.

20:56.120 --> 21:01.200
And I point to the creature in the glass that that's, that looks, that looks a little, a

21:01.200 --> 21:04.000
little more mobile and dangerous.

21:04.480 --> 21:07.120
It's got, it's got, it's just floating there.

21:08.440 --> 21:09.240
He's having a good time.

21:09.240 --> 21:10.160
It's a happy monkey.

21:10.200 --> 21:14.280
That's what makes me not want to just break the glass picture, breaking the glass and

21:14.280 --> 21:16.400
then letting a monkey out into this room.

21:16.560 --> 21:17.480
That would not be good.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.880
I'd like to have a monkey friend.

21:18.880 --> 21:19.200
I don't

21:20.640 --> 21:21.960
monkeys are horrifying.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.080
Haven't you seen the move in pictures?

21:24.120 --> 21:29.520
I think you could probably make a lot of money with a monkey act to around train your

21:29.520 --> 21:29.960
monkey.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.880
That's opportunity right there.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.720
Maybe that's how those, all those men became faceless.

21:36.280 --> 21:39.720
We should probably let the doc read his book and see what he finds out before we make

21:39.720 --> 21:40.360
any moves.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.840
Well, while he's reading, we can at least unscrew it.

21:44.080 --> 21:46.600
What if it desperately needs to stay where it is?

21:46.600 --> 21:54.160
Is the floating monkey creature, is it, are its eyes open?

21:54.520 --> 21:55.040
Eyes?

21:55.200 --> 21:55.840
What eyes?

21:58.800 --> 22:01.040
Are you reading anything good and the fun is there doc?

22:01.280 --> 22:01.880
Yeah.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.200
So what Dr.

22:04.200 --> 22:10.040
Osteen is picking up from the book is you to remember Dr.

22:10.040 --> 22:19.200
Hawks was obsessed with the work of another physicist or an inventor who had also, well

22:19.200 --> 22:25.320
not vanished, but died under mysterious circumstances a little over 10 years ago, a

22:25.320 --> 22:27.080
man called Crawford Tillinghast.

22:27.800 --> 22:35.320
And he'd created some kind of device that would shape human perceptions and allow

22:35.320 --> 22:40.200
people to see through to other dimensions of reality.

22:40.960 --> 22:49.040
But what Hawks seems to have done is taken the subjectivity out of the Tillinghast

22:49.040 --> 22:56.160
resonator and created what he refers to as the Hawks device, which creates much the

22:56.160 --> 23:02.520
same effect, but in objective reality, rather than it just being an individual who

23:02.560 --> 23:09.680
perceives it because of the changes to their pineal gland, that it does actually reshape

23:09.680 --> 23:13.320
an area of reality so that it shifts through the dimensions.

23:16.160 --> 23:16.800
Hey, Scott.

23:17.840 --> 23:18.560
Fuck yeah, dude.

23:18.560 --> 23:19.640
That's awesome.

23:23.640 --> 23:29.440
But you think from having flipped through this journal that you do have a better idea

23:29.480 --> 23:37.240
now of how to operate the Hawks device, that, yeah, your initial surmise was correct, that

23:37.240 --> 23:44.920
the ring in the floor does seem to be containment of this hole or whatever it is that's

23:44.920 --> 23:46.200
being ripped through reality.

23:46.400 --> 23:52.360
From some of the later entries, though, as you flick through the whole thing, there are

23:52.360 --> 23:54.120
some worrying indications.

23:54.760 --> 23:58.840
Now, that's another thing. Up to about eight years ago, the entries in this were being

23:58.840 --> 24:01.760
written by Aston Hawks.

24:02.200 --> 24:07.760
They changed hands, though, and the later entries are all written by someone else.

24:07.920 --> 24:09.320
You're not quite sure who.

24:10.360 --> 24:18.360
And the indication is that in recent weeks, as they've been going on their fishing

24:18.360 --> 24:24.960
expeditions, pulling things through from these higher dimensions, the containment from

24:24.960 --> 24:27.240
that ring on the floor is failing.

24:29.840 --> 24:36.560
We were right, but it may not be working as intended.

24:36.800 --> 24:41.360
So maybe like the best idea is kind of what Dr.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.040
Nate was saying earlier.

24:43.400 --> 24:47.200
And what if we just shove it in real quick and then shut it off?

24:47.200 --> 24:51.280
And hopefully nothing breaks containment in that short amount of time.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.280
I like it.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.000
It seems like a good experiment.

24:55.440 --> 24:59.760
Do we get the sense that if we did get it unbolted from the wall, would we be able to do

24:59.760 --> 25:00.720
what we're thinking of?

25:01.240 --> 25:03.040
Do we feel like we could push this tank?

25:03.360 --> 25:08.800
In fact, yeah, the whole thing looks unwieldy enough that, you know, if you unscrewed it

25:08.800 --> 25:12.320
from the wall, it would probably do most of the falling over work itself.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.960
OK. Perf, consider it unscrewed.

25:16.720 --> 25:23.880
Well, with the tools you've got there, let's have a mechanical repair roll off one of you

25:23.920 --> 25:27.840
just to see whether you can do this in an orderly manner.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.600
I'll do it. What do you have?

25:31.360 --> 25:36.880
70 luck. I have a 50 mechanical repair.

25:37.320 --> 25:40.160
Yeah, I've got a 40. I have a 20, but I feel good.

25:40.360 --> 25:41.680
You feel good? Yeah.

25:41.680 --> 25:42.760
And I mean, Dr.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.760
Rustine is still busy reading the journal.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.880
Right. This is what the others are doing while you're doing that.

25:48.080 --> 25:53.040
All right. 54, so I'll spend 34.

25:53.920 --> 25:59.160
OK. At first, obviously, this has been bolted into the wall for some time.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.600
And at first it's fairly rusty.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.080
So you're having to put a bit brute force in there.

26:03.520 --> 26:11.120
And a few times the spanner slips and things judder in an alarming manner.

26:11.120 --> 26:14.360
But you do manage to just keep it under control.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.120
And you're getting down to the last few bolts.

26:17.120 --> 26:22.120
The thing is, like I say, it's not very well balanced and it seems to be pulling itself

26:22.120 --> 26:24.160
away from the wall at this stage.

26:25.160 --> 26:29.440
And if you remove the last few bolts at this stage, it is going to come crashing down.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.720
Wait for it. All right.

26:32.520 --> 26:33.560
Holding on dearly.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.080
Docs, respectively. Freddy's ready over here.

26:36.280 --> 26:38.640
We're ready to flip the switch.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.720
Should I turn it on?

26:39.840 --> 26:43.680
I'm going to go to a workbench and make sure that I have a pair of forceps and a metal

26:43.680 --> 26:46.480
canister handy, ready, just in case.

26:46.520 --> 26:47.760
Grab the big one first.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.440
I think I'm ready.

26:50.440 --> 26:51.400
I think I'm ready.

26:51.640 --> 26:59.680
Then let's have a physics roll, first of all, or electrical repair, whichever is higher,

27:00.480 --> 27:05.280
from Dr. Rothstein, just to operate the machinery based on what you've read.

27:06.480 --> 27:08.600
OK, my physics is 70.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.680
OK. And I got a 22.

27:12.280 --> 27:14.120
Nice. It's a hard success.

27:14.400 --> 27:18.880
So, yeah, you've picked up enough from this book that this is all fairly simple.

27:19.200 --> 27:24.160
And you can see that, yeah, perhaps, you know, whoever has been working on the journal

27:24.160 --> 27:29.560
since then has perhaps got some of the settings slightly wrong, or at least you hope

27:29.560 --> 27:32.840
that you're not compounding the problem as you make a few changes.

27:33.800 --> 27:39.480
But then if you're ready to do the deed, are you just pulling down the live switch to

27:39.480 --> 27:41.360
activate it once you've got everything set up?

27:42.000 --> 27:43.800
That's what I was going to do.

27:44.040 --> 27:46.960
So if that's what I've gotten from the book, then.

27:47.320 --> 27:55.200
Then you do that and, yeah, there is this sparking and the metal ring of the ground

27:55.200 --> 28:01.120
starts glowing and almost immediately it's like a heat haze, something rising from the

28:01.120 --> 28:07.920
ground. Where you were looking across the room before, now in the center of the room,

28:07.920 --> 28:12.280
in that ring, there is something else.

28:13.040 --> 28:16.960
There is a shifting landscape, maybe.

28:16.960 --> 28:23.120
I mean, your eyes and brain are trying to make sense of it and, you know, it sort of

28:23.120 --> 28:28.120
makes sense to try to imagine this as a landscape, but that doesn't really work.

28:29.240 --> 28:35.800
There are certainly shapes there and things that are moving, all sorts of strange

28:35.800 --> 28:38.640
things, some of them small, some of them large.

28:38.640 --> 28:44.440
It is perhaps like looking into a fish tank or some kind of display of deep sea

28:44.440 --> 28:49.960
creatures. And there are perhaps, you know, some like the creature you've seen before.

28:50.440 --> 28:54.800
There are other things that are larger, that look more predatory, that are shifting

28:54.800 --> 28:58.640
around. Some of them have eyes, some of them have other sensory organs.

28:58.800 --> 29:04.520
And there is the uncomfortable feeling that as you're looking at them, they're starting

29:04.520 --> 29:06.080
to look at you as well.

29:06.720 --> 29:07.920
Let's have sanity rolls up.

29:07.920 --> 29:11.440
It's working. It's working.

29:16.600 --> 29:21.720
Hell, yeah, I fail with a 90 again, I think I've rolled 90s on all of my sanity rolls.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.800
31, I fail, 34.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.400
Pass. I pass with a 13.

29:27.680 --> 29:28.920
So it was melon coons.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.960
OK, so can each of you lose a D6, please?

29:34.400 --> 29:36.280
Come on, baby. I lost three.

29:36.280 --> 29:36.680
Five.

29:38.920 --> 29:47.000
So, Dr. Coons, he's shaken, but at least he's not out of his right mind at the moment.

29:47.480 --> 29:52.600
Sort of jumps back from the circle and bumps up against one of the workbenchers, knocking

29:52.600 --> 29:57.440
tools off. But he is composing himself.

29:57.720 --> 30:00.360
Melon, on the other hand, needs to make an intelligence roll.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.800
Fredrick Melon, so smart, 24 under 60.

30:06.560 --> 30:11.200
Yeah, at this stage, all good sense has left your mind.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.640
You are panicking.

30:13.640 --> 30:17.360
You've misjudged this whole situation.

30:17.680 --> 30:20.360
You need to get out of here as quickly as possible.

30:20.640 --> 30:25.400
The problem is that, you know, in your panic, you can't see a way out of here.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.280
There was that thing that Rothstein mentioned before about containment failing.

30:30.440 --> 30:37.720
And as you're looking around here, you can see that this isn't just contained within this

30:37.720 --> 30:44.080
circle. You can see that there's ripples in the air all around, that you're there trapped

30:44.080 --> 30:45.200
at the back of the room.

30:45.680 --> 30:48.920
How the hell are you going to get out of here without falling into this and getting lost

30:48.920 --> 30:51.640
forever? How are you going to get out of this alive?

30:52.520 --> 30:59.360
Fredrick Melon, the foist, as he's doing what he was meant to do, which was to, like, push

30:59.360 --> 31:08.000
this this big aquarium over, instead turns and is trying to claw through the stone behind

31:08.000 --> 31:14.200
him and falling to the ground, kind of like claws down into the floor, trying to escape

31:14.200 --> 31:19.760
like a like a rat trapped in a heated up metal bucket stuck on a snitch's belly.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.320
Nice.

31:21.600 --> 31:24.680
Can you give me a luck roll, please?

31:25.280 --> 31:26.000
I can.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.000
32 on a 36.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.000
Oh, dear. Oh, well.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.480
So, yeah, no, you are just clawing.

31:38.480 --> 31:39.560
Oh, no, I misread that.

31:39.560 --> 31:40.920
It's actually a 100.

31:44.040 --> 31:44.400
Whoops.

31:45.920 --> 31:46.880
Classic mistake.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.440
So it's a 100, is it?

31:50.760 --> 31:53.040
No, I passed.

31:54.720 --> 31:59.920
OK, so no, you're there on the floor, you're clawing away and you jog the tank for a

31:59.920 --> 32:04.320
moment and it creaks and almost comes away from the wall, but doesn't quite.

32:04.640 --> 32:09.480
And there's bits of the liquid sloshing down the side, dripping on the ground.

32:10.040 --> 32:14.000
And you can hear something above as you jostle the tank.

32:14.360 --> 32:18.800
There's you saw that there's some kind of metal hatch on the top and there's something

32:19.000 --> 32:23.600
you're convinced now that's just slamming against the tank, just slamming against the

32:23.600 --> 32:26.400
hatch, trying to force it open from the inside.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.160
You know, it knows you're out there.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.760
It's it's clearly coming for you.

32:35.360 --> 32:36.640
Oh, my God.

32:39.160 --> 32:46.440
Scott, we'll we'll send you a clip of that because the video slowed you down so

32:46.440 --> 32:48.520
intensely. Did you guys see what I saw?

32:48.960 --> 32:51.920
Slowed you down so intensely as you're describing.

32:52.160 --> 32:55.320
And then there at the end, it sped you up.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.800
So it's coming for you.

32:58.520 --> 33:01.160
Nice. It was really great.

33:05.160 --> 33:10.880
Oh, anyway, so what's everyone else doing while Frederick is losing his shit?

33:10.920 --> 33:12.120
Do we notice that? Right.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.400
Do we see something happening to him?

33:14.400 --> 33:17.040
I mean, he is clearly just panicking.

33:17.040 --> 33:18.000
I mean, you can see him.

33:18.200 --> 33:19.600
He's down on his hands and knees.

33:19.600 --> 33:23.320
He's actually beneath the tank now, just clawing away at the ground.

33:24.200 --> 33:28.840
From my point in the room, can I would I be able to get to one of those bolts, one of

33:28.840 --> 33:30.040
the less bolts?

33:30.480 --> 33:33.120
I would like to try and do that while I'm yelling out to Frederick.

33:33.120 --> 33:34.440
Frederick, get it together.

33:34.440 --> 33:35.640
We got to we got to finish this.

33:35.640 --> 33:36.920
Now is not the time for this.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.600
Frederick is now under the tank.

33:40.280 --> 33:43.920
So, oh, as in if it comes off the wall, it'll crush him.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.960
There's a chance. Glass isn't that dangerous.

33:48.840 --> 33:50.800
He's under it. He might be in the safest place.

33:50.800 --> 33:53.400
You know, a lot of this seems to be made of metal.

33:53.560 --> 33:56.800
Actually, I mean, it probably has occurred to Dr.

33:56.800 --> 34:02.840
Rothstein that the metals in this room, none of them seem to be ferrous metals.

34:02.840 --> 34:07.040
They they mostly seem to be aluminium, which makes sense because science.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.720
Well, that means they're non-conductive, right?

34:08.760 --> 34:10.040
Or magnetic. Yeah.

34:10.080 --> 34:14.240
Yeah. Rothstein doesn't even think to mention it because he's like so obvious.

34:14.240 --> 34:20.280
Yeah. If let's say that there were like two bolts left.

34:20.280 --> 34:23.760
He's loosening. I'm trying to get one of them loosened also.

34:23.920 --> 34:26.320
Dolan is running over to help Coombs.

34:26.640 --> 34:29.880
So, yeah, I mean, between the two of you can get the last two bolts off.

34:30.200 --> 34:36.240
Are you getting Freddy to safety before you do this or are you just taking your chances

34:36.480 --> 34:38.320
and hoping that the tank doesn't crush him?

34:45.000 --> 34:48.360
You know, ideally, we get Freddy out of there, but...

34:49.320 --> 34:50.720
Yeah, I'll try and get him out.

34:50.720 --> 34:53.920
I'll try to get him out. That's for sure what Nathaniel Coombs would do.

34:55.440 --> 34:56.880
Yeah, it's part of his bio.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.120
He would try to help.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.680
Which frees Dolan to focus on the tank.

35:03.440 --> 35:07.760
Well, then for Dr. Coombs, give me a STRENGTH roll just to see whether you can drag him

35:07.760 --> 35:10.280
to safety before this thing comes crashing down.

35:11.960 --> 35:12.240
OK.

35:15.080 --> 35:19.080
I FAIL a 95.

35:19.280 --> 35:22.840
You've got hold of him, but he's just pulling away too hard.

35:23.200 --> 35:28.160
And you can see that Dolan's got just about the last bolt out.

35:28.440 --> 35:34.680
You can try pushing the roll, but that means that you're not going to get free either

35:35.120 --> 35:37.480
if this comes crashing down before you do so.

35:39.560 --> 35:40.400
Oh, shit.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.320
Sedgwick, they said it was Sedgwick.

35:43.400 --> 35:47.400
Sedgwick was the one who was taking over, but he was he was he's not the closer.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.080
He's not the closer. He can't close it.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.000
He can't contain it.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.640
It's not Kira. It's just not Kira.

35:52.760 --> 35:54.240
I'm going to I'm going to push the roll.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.160
I'm going to try it.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.040
Nice.

36:02.800 --> 36:03.600
I FAIL.

36:05.600 --> 36:13.040
OK, so, yeah, Dolan can see that Coombs is just pulling Mel into safety, just

36:13.040 --> 36:15.840
getting him out of the way as you're taking this last bolt out.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.520
And you think you're free and clear just to get the last bolt.

36:18.800 --> 36:24.160
And then just as you get it clear, Melon pulls Coombs back in the path of all this,

36:24.160 --> 36:26.360
just as it comes topping down.

36:27.240 --> 36:32.920
So what I will do is I'll give both Coombs and Melon the chance to do a DODGE roll just

36:32.920 --> 36:36.440
to roll clear as this tank comes crashing down.

36:39.360 --> 36:40.360
Thank you.

36:43.040 --> 36:47.760
I pass. I got a fourteen on a thirty five.

36:48.080 --> 36:48.760
Nice.

36:48.880 --> 36:51.120
I got a fifty five on a fifty.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.320
So I'm going to spin five luck.

36:53.640 --> 36:54.920
Nice. Fuck yeah.

36:55.440 --> 36:55.920
OK.

36:56.560 --> 37:04.080
So you both just managed to roll clear as the tank comes crashing down and the glass

37:04.320 --> 37:10.560
shatters, liquid comes pouring out the front and these things come flopping and

37:10.600 --> 37:13.920
wriggling out from all over the place.

37:15.040 --> 37:19.680
Let's have LUCK rolls off the two of you as you're both down on the ground beside this

37:20.040 --> 37:24.040
to see whether any of the creatures take an interest in you.

37:28.560 --> 37:29.240
Ought nine.

37:29.480 --> 37:32.080
I fail a forty on a twenty five.

37:32.960 --> 37:38.040
So Dr. Coombs, as he's lying there on the ground, trying to get his breath, having just

37:38.040 --> 37:45.240
rolled out of the way, sees just the tail end of one of these spiny creatures

37:45.240 --> 37:48.760
disappearing into his side and wriggling inside him.

37:50.160 --> 37:53.560
Oh, I got one in me.

37:53.760 --> 37:54.600
I got one in me.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.200
Don't worry too much, Doc.

37:56.480 --> 38:01.480
Obviously, you know, there's the fellow in the woods and probably a few back on the

38:01.480 --> 38:06.720
camp. We're going to have to do this whole process at least one more time so we can get

38:06.720 --> 38:07.320
that one out of you.

38:08.040 --> 38:17.720
Dr. Rothstein is obviously trying to maintain the containment as best he can, I guess.

38:17.720 --> 38:22.200
Yeah, he, once it got flipped on, was just awestruck by it.

38:22.200 --> 38:27.640
And he remembers the conversations that he had had with with Hawk about stuff like this.

38:27.640 --> 38:30.120
And he's just amazed that it's right there in front of him.

38:30.680 --> 38:36.360
And then he hears a giant crash and focuses on, like, maintaining the portal.

38:36.640 --> 38:42.040
So far, the containment seems to be OK.

38:42.280 --> 38:50.200
You do notice that you can't actually see the ring in the ground anymore and that every

38:50.200 --> 38:55.000
now and then out of the corner of your eye, you can see just shifts in the air around

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
you as if it's not all just happening within the center of the room.

39:00.280 --> 39:04.800
That freaks him out a little bit, but he, I guess, kind of still skimming through the

39:04.800 --> 39:09.520
book, looking for any notes about how to change it or anything.

39:10.280 --> 39:13.880
Yeah, I mean, there's all sorts of ideas in there, but it looks like whoever has been

39:13.880 --> 39:23.360
writing these notes has changed his mind so often that it's proving not very useful.

39:25.160 --> 39:32.760
Whoever it is who's been maintaining Hawk's work since then does not seem to really fully

39:32.760 --> 39:34.400
grasp how all this works.

39:34.800 --> 39:39.800
I'm going to start helping throw worms into it, into the center then.

39:41.800 --> 39:51.800
OK, then let's put this down then to whichever one of you would like to make a DEX

39:51.800 --> 39:57.600
roll, who's busy throwing these things in, just to see how long it takes you to wrangle

39:57.600 --> 40:00.520
all these creatures and throw them into the center.

40:00.800 --> 40:01.720
I've got a 50.

40:01.720 --> 40:02.560
I've got a 50.

40:02.560 --> 40:03.760
I've got a 70.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.440
Would I be able to take part in this?

40:05.840 --> 40:09.520
Yeah, I assume you're all just throwing these creatures in.

40:09.960 --> 40:10.240
Yeah.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.000
So, yeah, let's have Dr.

40:12.000 --> 40:12.840
Coons do it.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.800
I pass a 58 on a 70.

40:17.800 --> 40:25.440
OK, that's good, because what you notice as you're throwing the creatures in is that the

40:25.440 --> 40:31.000
other creatures you can see within the zone or whatever it is that's being created.

40:31.400 --> 40:35.600
And it's difficult to read their intentions like you would animals, because you can't

40:35.600 --> 40:40.000
really hear them and they don't necessarily behave in the same way.

40:40.720 --> 40:45.440
But you're seeing what you consider to be perhaps some kind of flock behavior or

40:46.120 --> 40:53.040
certainly the kind of behavior you might see in birds or fish or whatever that are

40:53.040 --> 40:58.600
beginning to look agitated and moving in formation away from maybe some approaching

40:58.600 --> 40:59.240
predator.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.120
Oh, shit.

41:02.440 --> 41:04.440
What's Inside Out Monkey doing?

41:04.440 --> 41:06.040
Did he get into the portal already?

41:06.200 --> 41:09.160
It's just flopping on the ground at the moment.

41:09.520 --> 41:12.160
It's bigger.

41:12.640 --> 41:19.200
And so it's just, yeah, it doesn't look like it's very mobile outside of a liquid

41:19.200 --> 41:19.960
environment.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.720
I'm trying to kick it into the center.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.800
You're kicking it into the center.

41:24.160 --> 41:25.680
Oh, OK, good.

41:26.120 --> 41:26.840
Right.

41:26.840 --> 41:27.320
Then...

41:33.080 --> 41:34.280
You love to see it.

41:35.680 --> 41:45.160
OK, as you kick it, it doesn't seem very happy about this and it lets out what you

41:45.160 --> 41:51.720
think is probably a scream of pain, or at least that's what you get for the first

41:51.720 --> 41:53.080
couple of seconds of it.

41:54.080 --> 41:59.720
But the sound, it does something to your brain as you hear it, and you can just hear

42:00.440 --> 42:05.880
or feel your brain just shutting down in response to this sensory overload that's

42:05.880 --> 42:08.560
coming out of this pained creature.

42:09.480 --> 42:12.360
Yeah, I would like everyone to make power rolls, please.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.640
66 on a 40.

42:23.240 --> 42:26.280
I failed 79 on a 40.

42:26.520 --> 42:28.760
I passed with a 34 on a 40.

42:29.160 --> 42:30.880
Extreme pass, ought to.

42:31.200 --> 42:37.040
OK, so two of you are just, you're having to fight through this pain and confusion

42:37.040 --> 42:44.440
and you can see that your two companions have just dropped the ground and are just

42:44.680 --> 42:53.200
sitting or lying there looking vacantly as this thing sings or screams or whatever.

42:54.960 --> 43:01.240
But yeah, with that, I mean, you've got enough time that if you want, you can just

43:01.640 --> 43:07.560
finish the job of kicking it in or shoving it in through the barrier.

43:08.080 --> 43:09.480
Guys, you should try kicking it.

43:14.440 --> 43:17.920
Frederick Mellon will kick it.

43:18.280 --> 43:24.480
OK, and with a good punt, then, yeah, he goes, well, not quite sailing through the

43:24.480 --> 43:28.400
air, it's a bit big for that, but you managed to shove it and as it disappears

43:28.480 --> 43:33.360
into the the center of the room, then the sound stops.

43:34.360 --> 43:39.920
Your two companions, however, are still sitting on the ground looking quite glassy eyed.

43:40.880 --> 43:41.600
I'll kick them.

43:44.920 --> 43:48.640
I want to approach Carl because he's the one who's running this machine where he's

43:48.640 --> 43:50.360
going to be the one that we need to turn it off.

43:50.360 --> 43:54.800
So I'm rushing over to him and maybe like shaking him by the shoulders.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.520
Carl, Carl, you with us?

43:57.200 --> 43:59.280
We're going to need you to turn off this machine here pretty soon.

43:59.520 --> 44:02.200
And Carl is not responding in the slightest.

44:03.400 --> 44:10.240
I am going to grab forceps and try to pull the creature that went into Coombes

44:10.240 --> 44:12.800
earlier and then put it into Rothstein.

44:14.440 --> 44:26.440
So, yeah, you grab the forceps and you did see where the creature went in.

44:27.040 --> 44:30.920
So, Coombes, remember earlier we learned that they do the power.

44:30.920 --> 44:32.440
They suck it out of your body.

44:32.440 --> 44:35.160
We got to get the one that went in when you screamed earlier.

44:35.160 --> 44:36.200
We got to get it out of here.

44:36.200 --> 44:37.400
We got to put it in Rothstein.

44:37.400 --> 44:39.840
That way his eyes come back from the glassiness, OK?

44:39.840 --> 44:41.880
Just long enough for him to turn off the machine, right?

44:41.920 --> 44:43.240
Then we get it out of him, too, right?

44:43.480 --> 44:44.000
Enjoy.

44:45.240 --> 44:46.040
All right, all right.

44:46.040 --> 44:50.320
And I hold my arms up, giving him ample angle.

44:50.520 --> 44:59.400
Yeah, sure enough, you start fishing around inside the now molten flesh of Dr.

44:59.400 --> 45:07.160
Coombes, sticking your forceps in through his side and just digging around until you

45:07.160 --> 45:13.160
grab hold of something that you maybe hope isn't his pancreas and start pulling.

45:13.240 --> 45:18.320
I got it.

45:18.640 --> 45:28.040
So, for Dr. Coombes, can you roll a d3 twice, please?

45:29.200 --> 45:31.160
This could be very, very bad for you.

45:34.680 --> 45:38.520
I got a 1 and a 3.

45:39.520 --> 45:45.600
OK, so you lose 10 points of power and you lose 30 luck.

45:45.960 --> 45:47.160
That's more luck than I have.

45:47.160 --> 45:47.760
Does that matter?

45:48.080 --> 45:49.120
Or it just goes to zero?

45:49.120 --> 45:50.520
You die instantly.

45:50.600 --> 45:52.080
Your luck is now zero.

45:52.080 --> 45:55.200
So your group luck roll now is zero.

45:56.120 --> 45:57.560
Just putting that out there.

45:58.720 --> 45:59.440
Perfect.

45:59.440 --> 46:00.640
Kick him into the circle.

46:00.960 --> 46:02.840
I just wanted to get that pressure off you, Thomas.

46:02.840 --> 46:04.240
That's all that was.

46:04.720 --> 46:05.680
You're a good friend, Joe.

46:08.560 --> 46:13.760
OK, so, yeah, you can sort of see some of the life draining out of Dr.

46:13.760 --> 46:17.720
Coombes as you drag this screaming, thrashing creature out of him.

46:18.360 --> 46:20.760
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

46:22.440 --> 46:28.360
Yeah, his skin definitely looks drier and flakier and he just looks older somehow.

46:28.960 --> 46:30.080
Oh, that one got a lot.

46:30.080 --> 46:31.160
He's about to crumble.

46:34.080 --> 46:36.040
I'm very thirsty.

46:36.040 --> 46:42.960
And I'm going to kick Rothstein over and lift up his shirt.

46:43.520 --> 46:48.240
OK, so he's on his back and you're dropping the creature into, I'm

46:48.240 --> 46:49.440
going to, I'm not going to drop it.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.560
I'm going to hold onto it in the forceps.

46:52.080 --> 46:55.600
OK, and you're placing, you're placing it inside his body.

46:55.800 --> 46:58.960
I mean, it's what the man who I killed said to do.

46:59.240 --> 47:04.120
Yeah, I mean, you're going to have to release it because until it burrows

47:04.120 --> 47:09.560
its way into his body, his flesh isn't in that state where you can get the

47:09.560 --> 47:13.480
forceps in, at least not without cutting him open and gouging him.

47:13.760 --> 47:15.160
I'm going to try it first.

47:15.960 --> 47:18.680
I'm going to try it first where the forceps keep just like...

47:18.680 --> 47:19.920
Poking him really hard.

47:23.080 --> 47:24.320
Oh, God.

47:26.280 --> 47:28.240
Casper Brink, you dumb piece of shit.

47:30.560 --> 47:33.040
But eventually you do manage to get the creature into him.

47:33.880 --> 47:36.480
I'm going to wait until his eyes come back and then I'm going

47:36.560 --> 47:37.960
going right into his belly.

47:38.840 --> 47:47.160
Dr. Rothstein can gain 10 points of power and 10 points of luck as this

47:47.160 --> 47:49.240
creature wriggles its way inside him.

47:49.400 --> 47:54.120
And yeah, I suppose with that, with that jolt of energy, you do start

47:54.120 --> 47:55.480
to come out of your fugue state.

47:55.880 --> 47:58.680
Oh my, I feel fantastic.

47:58.840 --> 48:00.240
Frederick Mellon is just screaming.

48:00.360 --> 48:02.760
I like to think the entire time this is happening.

48:02.760 --> 48:12.880
He's just, let me, let me get a fresh set of eyes on these knobs and stuff.

48:13.680 --> 48:14.800
Mellon's still screaming.

48:14.880 --> 48:18.560
I was about to say, let's have a group luck roll to see what's happened

48:18.680 --> 48:21.320
with the containment while Dr.

48:21.320 --> 48:22.680
Rothstein's been unconscious.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.800
But of course we know what your group luck roll is now, don't we?

48:24.800 --> 48:26.360
But then you remember it would be pointless.

48:26.360 --> 48:30.080
So as Dr.

48:30.080 --> 48:35.200
Rothstein is coming out of this fugue state, he can see, yeah, that this, this

48:35.200 --> 48:41.560
area of otherness is spreading and has, you know, is now pushing up against where

48:41.560 --> 48:45.680
you are and it looks like it's almost about to engulf your feet where you're

48:45.680 --> 48:46.800
lying on the ground.

48:46.960 --> 48:55.440
You can also see now that all the smaller creatures have fled and there is the

48:55.440 --> 49:00.240
shadow or the outline of something very large coming your way.

49:00.720 --> 49:04.600
The scream turns into, shut it off, shut it off, shut it off, shut it off.

49:04.920 --> 49:06.880
I jump up and shut it off.

49:07.200 --> 49:12.880
Yeah, as you're jumping up and trying to shut this off before whatever it is

49:12.920 --> 49:17.680
reaches you, let's have a DEX roll to see whether you can do this nice and quickly.

49:17.880 --> 49:18.880
Can I try to help him up?

49:18.920 --> 49:21.760
I got a 13 on a 50.

49:21.920 --> 49:23.080
Oh, so, yeah.

49:23.160 --> 49:26.960
I whack your hand away from me and you're helping a ghost, man.

49:26.960 --> 49:27.960
He's already gone.

49:31.120 --> 49:31.440
I do.

49:31.440 --> 49:34.480
I lean down and try to help him up when he's standing on the other side.

49:35.120 --> 49:37.160
Yeah, I just flip the switch.

49:37.520 --> 49:37.920
Yeah.

49:37.920 --> 49:43.320
And, and I mean, the rest of you can see that there, yeah, there is something just

49:43.320 --> 49:52.800
huge that is just beginning to move into the center of the room and just pushing

49:52.800 --> 49:55.440
beyond the bounds of the containment here.

49:55.800 --> 50:00.480
And there's something that is reaching out towards you.

50:00.840 --> 50:03.720
And then just all of a sudden, the knife switch goes click.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.240
And there's just the metal ring in the center of the room, the stone floor.

50:09.520 --> 50:09.840
Whoa.

50:15.120 --> 50:16.520
Did it, did it work?

50:17.560 --> 50:18.280
Are we all here?

50:18.480 --> 50:20.040
Dolan is still dazed, right?

50:20.040 --> 50:22.680
Dolan is beginning to come out of it now.

50:23.120 --> 50:25.960
You've got no memory of what's just happened.

50:26.240 --> 50:26.760
Yeah.

50:27.080 --> 50:31.840
I mean, one moment, you know, the tank was going over and the next moment you're now

50:31.840 --> 50:35.960
sitting here and everyone's in different positions and you're not really sure what

50:35.960 --> 50:36.520
happened.

50:36.920 --> 50:38.280
Dolan, are you with us?

50:38.560 --> 50:41.160
Uh, park the car.

50:41.400 --> 50:42.440
I'm not really sure.

50:42.880 --> 50:43.880
Uh, park the car.

50:43.880 --> 50:46.560
We parked the car halfway down the driveway.

50:46.560 --> 50:47.480
It's facing out.

50:47.480 --> 50:48.960
That way we can get out quickly.

50:49.120 --> 50:49.800
Are they gone?

50:49.920 --> 50:51.880
Uh, did we, did we do it?

50:52.080 --> 50:54.200
Uh, yeah, we've solved everything.

50:54.600 --> 50:56.280
But how do you like them apples?

51:00.000 --> 51:02.920
Oh, except for we don't have the two missing kids.

51:03.840 --> 51:06.440
You know, that was always going to be icing on the cake, I think.

51:06.480 --> 51:06.760
Yeah.

51:06.760 --> 51:08.400
We don't have the two missing kids.

51:08.440 --> 51:13.760
And also I'm sure there's a lot of squeamy things out there in the woods that seem to

51:13.960 --> 51:14.840
still be out there.

51:14.840 --> 51:16.920
There's that guy that's fucked up.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.440
I can't, not on this, not on this one.

51:20.920 --> 51:28.960
And, uh, and, uh, yeah, I can't think of anything else, uh, left to do with anybody

51:28.960 --> 51:29.800
around here.

51:29.840 --> 51:32.920
We, we will have to do this again.

51:32.920 --> 51:33.200
Right.

51:33.240 --> 51:36.400
We're going to have to open the portal again to get for the things that are in

51:36.400 --> 51:40.360
Nancy and, uh, yeah, the other one.

51:40.360 --> 51:43.800
And then the, you know, that guy in the woods just seemed to be silly with them.

51:43.800 --> 51:47.640
So, uh, we might just have to throw him all the way in there.

51:47.760 --> 51:48.920
Didn't we buoyant some though?

51:49.080 --> 51:49.560
It's true.

51:49.560 --> 51:50.160
That's true.

51:50.480 --> 51:50.640
Yeah.

51:50.640 --> 51:52.440
We could just burn that fellow alive.

51:52.720 --> 51:57.800
I honestly don't think I want to take the risk of having that giant, giant thing at

51:57.800 --> 51:58.520
the end there.

51:58.560 --> 52:04.920
Did you see the, the, the, the, and like words being to fail him as he really just

52:04.920 --> 52:09.280
has no idea how to describe what was reaching out there at the end, right

52:09.280 --> 52:10.760
before it came down.

52:10.760 --> 52:15.960
You just see in his eyes, like, uh, the twinkle of constellations unknown.

52:16.240 --> 52:19.880
I don't have any recollection of that, but if you saw some kind of terrible

52:19.880 --> 52:24.040
shadow moving towards you through the thing, you know, presumably it would just

52:24.040 --> 52:24.560
move on.

52:24.840 --> 52:29.960
Like if we did it in 15 minutes, I don't, you know, 20, you know, an hour is still

52:29.960 --> 52:31.640
going to be waiting around for that portal.

52:31.640 --> 52:34.200
It saw no, it's going to be eating fishes somewhere else.

52:34.360 --> 52:40.040
Do you guys think that we should, uh, destroy this then if we're going to, if

52:40.040 --> 52:43.640
we're just going to burn the remaining ones, should we, should we destroy this

52:43.640 --> 52:44.080
machine?

52:44.560 --> 52:45.000
Yeah.

52:45.200 --> 52:47.520
Are we on team burn the remaining ones?

52:47.560 --> 52:48.720
No, we keep the machine.

52:48.720 --> 52:56.160
It's very, uh, I might make use of it, uh, to repurpose it.

52:56.200 --> 52:57.240
In what way, Doc?

52:57.320 --> 52:59.680
Uh, I won't, it will be safe.

53:01.560 --> 53:03.920
I don't know if we can trust this thing existing.

53:03.960 --> 53:05.520
I mean, we've seen what it can do.

53:05.520 --> 53:08.720
That's, that's, there's no way that that can be used for good, right?

53:09.200 --> 53:11.320
Ultimately it should absolutely be destroyed.

53:11.360 --> 53:13.600
I'm just saying, are we done destroying things with it?

53:14.120 --> 53:16.320
We should probably at least look at the lights in the house, right?

53:16.400 --> 53:18.440
Well, we got to go check out the lights in the house.

53:18.720 --> 53:20.240
We still got to find the kids.

53:20.240 --> 53:21.520
We've got to find Billy and Esther.

53:21.720 --> 53:22.160
Yeah.

53:22.480 --> 53:23.320
And the closer.

53:23.400 --> 53:25.240
How did you wake me up?

53:25.280 --> 53:26.920
How did you make me feel so good?

53:30.240 --> 53:31.840
Uh, you just kind of snapped out of it.

53:32.640 --> 53:34.360
Oh, fantastic.

53:36.360 --> 53:38.240
Well, nothing left to do there.

53:39.280 --> 53:40.320
Well, great.

53:40.760 --> 53:41.560
No, I'm just kidding.

53:41.560 --> 53:42.200
Lay down.

53:42.960 --> 53:43.440
What?

53:44.000 --> 53:48.560
I want you to lay down, lift up your shirt, and then I want you to do not

53:48.560 --> 53:50.440
look, do not look down.

53:50.440 --> 53:52.640
I immediately lift my shirt up and look.

53:53.520 --> 53:54.120
Okay.

53:54.320 --> 53:56.400
If you get it, did it eat its way inside me?

53:56.960 --> 53:57.800
Don't press.

53:57.880 --> 54:00.480
Don't, don't you dare press your fingers right above your belly.

54:00.480 --> 54:02.560
Press my finger right above my belly then.

54:03.040 --> 54:03.680
Okay.

54:03.680 --> 54:08.600
And, and your fingers sink right through your skin into your flesh.

54:08.640 --> 54:10.960
There's no ripping or tearing at the flesh.

54:11.520 --> 54:15.560
It's just like putting your fingers into a bowl of warm oatmeal.

54:15.560 --> 54:22.120
Oh, I immediately pull my hand out and I'm like, go ghost white.

54:22.120 --> 54:23.440
And flick the oatmeal off.

54:24.080 --> 54:24.320
Yeah.

54:24.320 --> 54:28.360
Let's have a sanity roll for that as you have just probed the

54:28.360 --> 54:29.720
inside of your own abdomen.

54:31.400 --> 54:32.720
I got a 69.

54:33.360 --> 54:34.000
A fail.

54:34.520 --> 54:36.240
So that's going to be a D4 San.

54:38.720 --> 54:39.800
Did you say 69?

54:40.920 --> 54:41.320
Yeah.

54:41.320 --> 54:41.680
Yeah.

54:43.200 --> 54:46.360
Do we, do we want to tell Scott about a really immature house rule?

54:50.240 --> 54:52.480
Which is that that's a crit success.

54:57.040 --> 54:57.280
Yeah.

54:57.280 --> 54:59.160
Usually I'm happy to see that number, but.

55:01.560 --> 55:05.160
I'm not going to force Scott to roll with our 69 as a

55:05.160 --> 55:06.760
critical success house rule.

55:06.760 --> 55:16.880
I am happy to, when in Rome, I shall embrace the 69.

55:16.880 --> 55:18.400
When in Rome, 69.

55:20.840 --> 55:21.200
Okay.

55:21.240 --> 55:23.640
In which case, yeah, you, you don't lose any San.

55:36.760 --> 56:02.880
Sorry.

56:02.880 --> 56:05.640
Just trying to get 30 minutes of silence to really get the

56:05.760 --> 56:10.320
noise quiet meditation time.

56:10.320 --> 56:10.840
Shut up.

56:12.680 --> 56:13.040
Sorry.

56:13.040 --> 56:16.600
I had, uh, I had a bunch of fans going that I had to go turn on.

56:18.720 --> 56:19.000
Okay.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.440
Well then let's get 30 seconds of silence from Thomas.

56:22.560 --> 56:25.760
Uh, cause it'll way over compress.

56:25.760 --> 56:29.120
If it's trying to cut out the fans that are no longer there.

56:29.320 --> 56:30.360
You guys can talk about it.

56:30.400 --> 56:32.320
Yeah, but you can't.

56:32.440 --> 56:35.560
Can we get a verbal confirmation that you understand?

56:36.640 --> 56:36.840
Yeah.

56:43.560 --> 56:44.960
Without Thomas able to talk.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.120
Is there a point in the rest of us speaking to each other?

56:48.720 --> 56:49.640
Can't think of any.

56:50.680 --> 56:57.080
Well, not apart from to taunt Thomas, but anyone got any good taunts?

56:58.480 --> 56:59.880
You look like you can't swim.

57:01.440 --> 57:02.000
I can swim.

57:03.160 --> 57:03.720
I can swim.

57:03.720 --> 57:05.520
I've put on a lot of weight lately though.

57:05.520 --> 57:09.160
So you could float better.

57:10.400 --> 57:11.920
No, it just, that's a place you guys could go.

57:17.720 --> 57:21.640
Dude, there was a, uh, I'm ashamed to start a story with this, but there

57:21.640 --> 57:23.640
was a tic talk the other day that I saw.

57:24.360 --> 57:26.240
But it's just this guy.

57:27.240 --> 57:30.440
Considering your, your internet culture consumption, that could have

57:30.440 --> 57:32.000
been like a billion times worse.

57:32.320 --> 57:37.480
Yeah, but, uh, it's this guy just like messing with his brother.

57:37.480 --> 57:42.080
He's like, dude, you just look like you like have never bowled a strike.

57:42.400 --> 57:46.880
And he's like, just like gets irrationally upset, like arguing.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.920
He's like, dude, I have my own ball.

57:49.160 --> 57:53.880
Like just getting really mad.

57:53.880 --> 57:56.600
And I'm like, that is a hilarious insult.

57:56.640 --> 57:59.760
Like do you see Thomas's eyes were darting around?

57:59.760 --> 58:01.840
He was trying to remember if he'd ever.

58:01.840 --> 58:05.120
I don't, I don't know if I have, I don't bowl that often.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.080
Um, I don't think I've bowled a strike in my adult life.

58:09.560 --> 58:14.640
You, you have, I was there and it was because we were all bowling and you asked

58:14.640 --> 58:18.320
Ben to give you a tip and he's told you about the bringing the hand up and

58:18.320 --> 58:22.000
touching the ear and the very next ball you rolled was a strike and we all were

58:22.000 --> 58:26.480
like, Ben knows how to bowl and knows how to teach people how to bowl that.

58:26.480 --> 58:26.840
Wow.

58:26.840 --> 58:29.080
You're telling me I just had to touch my ears this whole time.

58:29.120 --> 58:34.160
He's a teacher now, which is great, but I don't, I have never remembered that tip.

58:34.200 --> 58:35.480
So he's probably not a good one.

58:36.360 --> 58:40.040
I'm assuming you let go of the bowl, the bowl before touching your ear, because

58:40.040 --> 58:41.280
otherwise that's going to smart, right?

58:41.280 --> 58:41.800
Correct.

58:41.840 --> 58:42.720
Yeah, correct.

58:42.720 --> 58:45.040
That, that would hurt quite a bit.

58:46.480 --> 58:49.200
No, you actually bowl best with a concussion.

58:49.200 --> 58:56.080
So that's the, so actually my high game, I was on pain medication and wearing a

58:56.080 --> 59:02.880
boot on my ankle because I had like fractured a bone in my foot, but my family

59:02.880 --> 59:08.040
still decided that our outing that Saturday was going to be bowling.

59:08.400 --> 59:09.000
No, exactly.

59:09.000 --> 59:09.960
You can, you can do it.

59:10.440 --> 59:10.960
I bet.

59:11.600 --> 59:12.960
And I was like, yeah, okay.

59:12.960 --> 59:17.920
So I like would waddle up and I bowled seven strikes in a row to start off the

59:17.920 --> 59:18.160
game.

59:19.440 --> 59:19.920
Hell yeah.

59:20.240 --> 59:25.720
I don't remember it all exactly, but I do remember I left a couple open frames

59:25.720 --> 59:26.760
there upsetting.

59:27.120 --> 59:30.360
So the secret to good bowling is to be smacked off your tits.

59:30.760 --> 59:31.000
Yep.

59:31.080 --> 59:32.200
I think that's about right.

59:32.240 --> 59:33.320
That's the takeaway for sure.

59:33.360 --> 59:35.000
That is not what I found to be true.

59:38.600 --> 59:38.800
Yeah.

59:38.800 --> 59:41.640
My highest I ever bowled was a two Oh two.

59:42.000 --> 59:45.360
I had to go to Instagram to look cause I was so proud of myself.

59:46.600 --> 59:47.160
That's good.

59:47.840 --> 59:48.680
That is good.

59:48.680 --> 59:49.480
Yeah, that's really good.

59:49.480 --> 59:55.880
My high game was two 47, but my previous high game was like 160.

59:55.960 --> 01:00:00.720
So I've never bowled in between 160 and two 47.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:01.720
That's crazy.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:05.480
When I worked at the order, I picked up some, some tips from Jake that made me a

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.640
much better bowler and it made it really fun.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:14.600
It's fun to be good at something fun to play it when you're good at it.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:19.080
But he taught me how to do the like spinny curve throw game changer.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.160
Plus it's way more fun to do it that way.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.560
When you get the hang of it, that it does, it feels really good when you

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:28.880
get the spin thing working and you can just like throw the ball at the pans.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.880
That's a good strategy.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.160
As long as you knock them all down, you got to just touch your ear.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.080
And that's what I've always said.

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:39.760
So, um, we, so Luke run it back for me.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.280
Um, we went to the house.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.280
We did.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.200
Uh, what was the house called the house?

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.880
Yeah, we've talked about this while you were on the line.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.520
The home who must be named the name of the scenario.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.080
Bleak Oh, prospect.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:54.920
Yes.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.520
I yep.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.400
Good.

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.240
Uh, I was just testing you guys to see that you remembered

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.400
that there was a name for it.

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.040
We went to prospect thing.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:05.560
We passed.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:05.880
Yeah.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.440
Otherwise I would have refused to do the rest of the recap.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:16.040
So we went to prospect, uh, after, before, before we went there though,

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.720
we, uh, the slugs escaped, right?

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.240
Kinda kind of.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:22.480
Yeah.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:28.680
We went back to the, um, not the, like the camp or whatever.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.760
The Herbert town.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:30.600
Yes.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.600
Are they called Hoover towns?

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.440
Cause they suck.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.920
I love vacuum humor.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.440
And then we went to the house.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.720
We did some sort of portal, uh, broke a fish tank.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:46.840
There's a monkey.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:51.480
Yeah.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:56.640
This is going to be, I mean, I'm probably going to edit this out for sure,

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:01.960
especially because this will be in the same episode as what just happened.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:04.680
Incredible.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.960
We're coming in in the middle of an episode here,

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:14.040
but I think we'd left it that you just sort of finished everything that you

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.200
wanted to do in the laboratory.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:21.600
And that your plan now was to go to the main house and see whether you could

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.560
find out what had happened to the kids.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:23.880
Right.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:28.720
I remember, if nothing else, that the kids were our next plan of attack.

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.160
Yeah, we're going to go attack those kids.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:36.720
Well, it is now fully dark outside.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.720
There is, however, some light because when you switched the generators on, you

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:45.400
switched on some lights within Prospect itself.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.280
There isn't a lot of light coming out.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.000
It's not like every light in the place is now blazing.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.480
But there are a few.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:03:00.440
Now, you're around the side of the building at the moment, so you're pretty much

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:04.160
equidistant from both the front and the back entrances.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:11.000
With the new lights on, do we see any movement or signs of life within the house?

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.560
Yeah, there is a light on upstairs, a fairly faint one.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:24.680
You don't see any movement, but the window, yeah, the window looks a bit weird from down

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:31.320
here. It looks like it's got perhaps some strangely colored curtains across it, some

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:34.040
very moist looking curtains.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:46.800
I've seen a lot of acquaintance in my day, but none that look oh, is that you can tell

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.400
the thick and heavy with moisture?

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:54.640
Yeah, but are they thick and heavy like cloth is thick and heavy when it's got moisture

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.280
on it, or is it more thick and heavy?

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.280
Like he's an older gentleman.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.200
Let's say he's got that like turkey neck thing going on.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.880
So he just kind of grabs it as gobbler and he's like, oh, is it more like, and he just

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:11.160
starts kind of shaking around the like part by his Adam's apple, just kind of violently

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:16.080
making a kind of a wet slapping noise of the skin against his Adam's apple.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.120
Uh, skin draperies?

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:25.800
I mean, the answer really is neither.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:27.800
Oh, good.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:34.120
Yeah, no, it doesn't quite seem to be those things.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.440
I've seen a lot of a lot of skin in my in my time as a doctor.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.880
That doesn't look like skin curtains to me.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.280
I don't know why you would have floated that.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.960
That's kind of an out there thing to kind of jump to the conclusion.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.760
I'm kind of losing it a little bit, obviously.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.880
What's your first name?

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.400
For some reason, I can't remember.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.040
It's Doc out here, Doc, and it's hard to tell.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:58.320
It's Nathaniel, you really can remember that?

01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.360
Let me let me take a look at you.

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.480
Did you get hit?

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.560
Are you all right?

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.640
It feels like months have passed between the last moment we saw each other and now.

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:11.120
Yes, I wonder if I'll have the same accent.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.280
It sounds better.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:25.120
Okay, so if it's not my turkey neck that's hung up in the windows, then I feel a little bit safer going in there.

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:30.600
Doctor, now that you've told me that you've seen skin that ain't skin, then yeah.

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.080
Okay.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.520
Are we going in the front of the back?

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:37.960
Because they might expect us in the back, because if we're supposed to be sneaky, then we would go in the back.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:38.240
Right.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:41.600
And they clearly know something's up because we turned on the power.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
What about a window?

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:43.600
What's it about?

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.440
Yeah, God damn it.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.000
I was doing you.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.840
Yeah, a window.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.040
Yeah, I think that's a good idea, Luke.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.240
Why don't we look for a window down here?

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:56.000
Thank you.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.240
One thing I was going to say, though, is Dr.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:09.320
Coons can attempt to spot hidden role, actually, because unlike the others, you have a bit of medical knowledge that you can draw upon here that might help.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.640
I will give it a shot.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.280
I...

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.000
Oh, shit.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:15.760
I don't pass.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.840
It's a 27 on a 25.

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.800
You could spend two points of luck.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.760
I ain't got no luck, boys.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.800
That was one of the things that happened last session.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.280
Oh, yes.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.080
Yes.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.280
Shit.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.080
Does that mean our...

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:30.960
You've reminded Scott.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.680
...group luck roles are now at zero?

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:33.720
Yup.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.320
Guess who's about to call for a luck role?

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:44.720
Well, I guess it doesn't matter if I spend some of my precious 13 points anymore, because it can't affect the group.

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.280
Can I help him with that role?

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:46.800
You can't.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.640
With some of my luck, or...?

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.200
No, no, you can't.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:07:02.640
But what I will say is that, and it's difficult to tell what you're looking at through that window upstairs, because there's condensation on the inside of the window, and there's definitely something obfuscating the view.

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:12.200
But, yeah, there's something about the color and the texture of what you're looking at in the window that is just tickling the back of your brain.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:16.480
But you just can't get a good enough view to really work out what it is.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:20.640
There's something up with what's going on in that window up there.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.840
I don't think it's skin, but there's something odd about it.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.800
It's tickling the back of my brain.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.320
It's fucking kooky, that's for sure.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:30.720
Look at the color of it.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.640
I prefer not to.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.720
I don't want to look at this thing at all.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:42.800
I don't know if it's kookier or spookier, but I think we should be looking for a window that doesn't have these sort of abnormally wet...

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.560
These kooky, spooky curtains.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:44.960
Yeah.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.800
Exactly, exactly.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.640
Maybe it's a fluky curtain, too, and there's more that don't have them.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:55.960
Are there any windows on the bottom floor that don't have the spooky curtains?

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:56.720
Thanks, Luke.

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.520
There certainly are.

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:05.320
The windows are shuttered, but it wouldn't take much to pry the shutters away.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:13.920
Yeah, if you head around the side of the building a little bit, you can see that there are a few windows at Grand Devil here that you could investigate.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.120
Hey, guys, I found one.

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.600
OK, but like, do we even have a plan?

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.040
Get inside.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.040
Yeah, but what happens when we get inside?

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.520
We save the kids, cue in on.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.360
Explore, save the kids, get out.

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.160
What if we run into trouble?

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.480
We are the storm.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:40.240
We made a portal already today, so we can do anything.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.600
I like this guy's optimism.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.720
We can't do anything we put our mind to, Doc.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.000
You're absolutely right.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.840
Let's let's get in there.

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.400
Let's save these fucking kids.

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.640
Let's find a goddamn window we can open.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:55.600
I start trying to pry the boards off the window.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.440
OK, well, it's not boarded up.

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:06.200
It's like I say, shutters, which have largely been put in place, but you don't really need to make a roll or anything.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:12.000
There's a bit of creaking and grunting as you pull these rusted shutters away.

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:15.560
And there is some light on inside.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.320
You can see that you're looking into a room.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:33.960
Yeah, I mean, it's obviously a room, but the walls are covered with wallpaper or paint of some description that is glistening,

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:40.640
that it's sort of reddish purple and there's liquid trickling down it.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:49.600
Maybe we see if another room in this house isn't quite so kooky and spooky.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:55.760
This one seems to have a lot of the same vibes as that, the moist curtains.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:04.360
Now, we already spent the volume, you know, when you're breaking into a house, you really want to only break in through one place.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:11.960
That way, they, you know, if they hear you coming in through the first place, then they wouldn't be able to.

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.000
Fredrik, are you OK?

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:16.800
You're really?

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:20.520
Yeah, no, it's really early for you.

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.480
Let me let me help you up into the window.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:29.560
And I like offer him my hands to step into.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:40.440
Zach's tired, so if we just suggest thanks for his character, we can kind of we can kind of canary him through all these doors.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.800
Here I go through the window.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:54.680
OK, well, the window frame, you look at it, you don't think it's locked.

01:10:54.680 --> 01:11:02.160
But when you try pushing the sash window up, there's resistance.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:16.960
And as you do so, there's a sort of noise and there's something sort of wet and rubbery around the bottom of it that just pulls the window back down as you pull it up.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:26.720
And just for a moment, you get a blast of warm, moist air come out that fogs in the cold air.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:43.840
And there's a smell to it, maybe not an entirely repellent smell, but yeah, there's certainly some nasty undertones to it, but mostly it's is kind of warm and moist and meaty.

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:48.160
This goddamn house is fucking alive.

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:55.880
The squelching stuff that brought it back down is was it was it literally there?

01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.400
If we had if we had a knife or something, could we could we could we cut it away?

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:05.680
Yeah, I mean, looking at it, I mean, it perhaps reminds you a little bit of kind of bubble gum, maybe.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.480
Does does anybody have a knife?

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.440
We could we could we can get our way in here.

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.880
No, but my fingers are due for bubble gum.

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:20.160
This is just like some nasty smelling bubble gum that they're trying to keep the windows closed so that it's a weird sort of way.

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:29.120
I've never seen a house like this with a security system that uses bubble gum on the exterior of the interior of all the rooms to try to keep everything closed.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.040
But I figure I could chew it away, probably.

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.320
Guys, two things.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:39.960
One, I think we obviously let Freddie keep volunteering for all this all this dangerous shit.

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:44.160
But then to Freddie, I love your enthusiasm.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:50.920
Maybe go back to your original plan of the hands, not just eating the bubble gum, because I don't think that's bubble gum.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.720
But also, why don't you use my knife?

01:12:54.440 --> 01:13:00.680
So Frederick Millen I takes the knife and will open up the window once more.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:11.440
And as he slowly opens it up, he'll slide the blade just in between the window and the threshold and just kind of like, slide it along.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.880
Slide is probably optimistic.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:15.680
It is more hacking.

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.720
Ah, yes.

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:20.120
Well, Frederick Millen I is nothing if not optimistic.

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.760
I thought you were going to say a hack.

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:22.880
I thought you were too.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:38.520
But yeah, with a bit of elbow grease, you can gouge away and there is fluid now bubbling down over the edge of the windowsill.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:49.920
And inside the house, you can hear what sounds like a creaking, groaning sound coming from deep within.

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.120
And just for a moment, the wall shakes and trembles.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:56.480
After you, Freddie.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.280
I'm in.

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:05.240
As you cut the last of it away, you get the window up, you can climb in.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:13.960
What I do want is not a CLIMB roll, but just the DEX roll, I think, just to see how gracefully you can do this.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:20.200
Because what you realize as you're clambering through is everything inside is slippery as fuck.

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.920
Extreme success.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.640
I rolled a 12 on a 65.

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.640
Fantastic.

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:27.080
Nice.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:42.120
OK, then, yeah, despite the fact that you're coming in on what is a window ledge and then there's maybe a few bits jutting out of the floor that once upon a time were furniture,

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:47.560
but are now again covered with this pulsating pinkish purple stuff.

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:53.560
I mean, despite that, you've managed to land on your feet and not slip over the floor.

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:59.120
The floor is also covered with all of this, plus a few inches of fluid.

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.800
Yeah, it is incredibly slippery.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:05.280
Hey, guys, it's like an ice skating rink in the air.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.160
Now that you're inside and get a good look at all this.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:09.600
You've got to be really careful.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:12.160
I would like a sansi roll.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:17.280
Oh, yeah, because you're in the meat house.

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.240
Sixty two on a sixty four.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:22.040
OK, then, yeah, you don't lose any.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:29.320
It's just a very wet, very squelchy, very slippery room.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.360
Completely normal.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.520
Thomas, Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:36.280
Can you hear anything from where you are?

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:41.360
Yeah, I can hear groaning coming from deep within the house.

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:44.440
Doesn't sound like missing children, but.

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.840
And then he just kind of shrugs his shoulders.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:51.480
If you wanted to try to discern more than that, you could give me a listen roll.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:52.600
Give me a second.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.280
I'm going to try to discern more than that.

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:58.880
I rolled a sixty seven on a fifty, so that's a fail.

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:01.800
But he is going to like

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:09.880
he's going to try to slide across the room as quietly as possible to hear better,

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:16.240
because if he's further away from the three men and the outside, he might be able to hear better.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:20.080
He pushes himself along the room.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.520
Yeah, you can push the roll here.

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:26.520
I fail.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:27.400
No.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:37.040
Well, as you're pushing your way across the floor to try to find somewhere quieter away from the others,

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:44.360
you hit a bit of the floor, which it wasn't obvious because it's all covered with this

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:47.200
membranous whatever it is.

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:55.760
But there's a bit where you suddenly realize as you reach it that the wood underneath or the flooring underneath has rotted away.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:03.200
And you work this out just as your foot goes straight through it with this sort of wet ripping sound.

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:10.360
And the next thing you know, you're up to your waist in the floor and desperately scrabbling, holding on,

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:18.200
trying to hold on to this as this wet, slippery surface as you are falling or slipping through this hole in the floor.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:24.000
From down below you, you can smell this indescribable stench.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:30.240
There are acid acrid vapors coming up, burning your eyes and this overpowering smell like

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:35.080
the worst septic tank you've ever smelt down below.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.920
Oh, God.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:46.680
Help, help, help, help, help, help, oh, God, oh, God, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:51.280
Guys, while we're still all outside, do we help him or do we just leave him here?

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.400
You're a doctor.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.840
You've got to help him.

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.160
I've got to get in there.

01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:58.080
I've got to get in there. Give me a boost.

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:58.600
Give me a boost.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:17:59.600
You're a doctor, too.

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.240
Not that kind of doctor.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.960
OK, so, yeah, you can push Dr.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.480
Coombes in through the window.

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:13.880
Again, you know, if you're going to try to avoid just sliding around helplessly, I do want to DEX roll.

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:14.960
Sure.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.160
I fail, fail.

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.040
Push it.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.840
But I want, yeah.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:29.960
When I get up, I get a hand on something firm and my hand just slips right off.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:31.080
Oh, damn.

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.960
And I'm kind of, I'm kind of wiggling, rolling through.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:40.640
And I'm going to try and restabilize myself by grabbing hold of the window frame and getting a better purchase on everything there.

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.120
Oh, OK.

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.600
And then I pass.

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:44.600
Oh, good.

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:51.480
Because otherwise that was going to set off a motherfucker of a chain reaction.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:08.400
But, OK, yes, you managed to grab hold of something that, yeah, from the general shape of it, you think might be a chair.

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:15.520
And certainly your fingers go through a couple of things that you hope are wooden struts and not, say, ribs.

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.760
But, yeah, holding on to it, you managed to get yourself onto your feet.

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:32.080
You can see Freddy just about five feet away from you, just slowly slipping down this hole, his fingernails digging into this wet tissue, ripping holes in it.

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:33.840
But it's just so slippery.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.120
He's just falling down in slow motion, inch by inch.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:45.200
I want to try and anchor myself on the nearest solid object and reach for him.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.440
It might be the frame of the window, if it's all.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:52.840
If he's grabbing the frame of the window, I want to grab his arm from the outside.

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.360
OK, yeah, yeah, you can try to do that.

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.080
How tall up is, like, the window?

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:04.120
It's about three foot off the ground from within and about five foot off the ground from outside.

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:07.440
So I'm kind of reaching up and just trying to hold onto his hand.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:19.000
OK, I think in order to give Freddy something to hold on to just because of the distance involved, the best thing you're going to be able to do is stick your leg out and hope that he can grab hold of your ankle.

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.040
Freddy, Freddy, grab on, grab on.

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:26.360
Then, yeah, I think Freddy can make a DEX roll here to see whether he can grab hold of Dr.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:29.880
Coombes' ankle, because otherwise shit is going to get real.

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.960
Yes, 52 on a 65.

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:49.480
OK, yeah, you just managed to grab hold of the cuff of his rather frayed trousers and your fingers have got a firm grasp and you can just you can pull yourself up, you know, using it almost like a rope.

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:58.560
And there's this horrible, wet squelching sound as you're pulling yourself out of this hole and more of this hideous, hideous stench coming up.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.640
Aw, look at my pants.

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.280
All right, let's let's get them both out of there, guys.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.080
Carl, help me, help me pull them out.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:12.720
I grab on to Thomas's waist and try to yank them out.

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:13.880
We got to go deeper.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:20.080
When Freddy's close enough up onto me, I grab him up under the arms and kind of just tumble backwards out of the window with him.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:23.760
Yeah, yeah. I mean, between you, you can get him back out through the window.

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:30.520
He is absolutely covered in just slime and bits of tissue and...

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:32.400
Not much different from his normal appearance.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:35.040
Or me in seventh grade.

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:43.520
Dr. Coons, I think, can make an education roll here just to piece something together.

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:50.080
Pass, twenty four on an eighty.

01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.800
So that's a that's the that's a good pass.

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.560
Yeah, that is what we call a good pass.

01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:57.000
Yes.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.960
It's the pass right before Easter.

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:17.760
So as Freddy's picking bits of this tissue off himself and you get a better look through the light that's coming out through the window.

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:30.160
Yeah, you can see there is something very much about this that reminds you of the lining of the large intestine.

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.240
Fellas, I don't I don't know how to how to say this.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.640
Then maybe keep it to yourself.

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:45.400
We got to know.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:50.680
This all looks it looks like it's it's it's the stuff that you use.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.600
It's it's it's intestine.

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:55.240
It might have been trying to digest you in some way.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.440
I don't I fucking knew it.

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:57.800
The house is alive.

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.920
It's a goddamn monster house written by Dan Harmon.

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.240
This is this is a lot bigger than we thought, boys.

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:08.920
Is there like a groundskeeping garage or home or anything?

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:14.720
Boys, here's what I think we got to do before we get back into the house is we got to put some hobnails on our boots.

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:20.240
So I literally just want to find nails to run through our shoes.

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.600
We're going to take our shoes off first, though, right?

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.080
Well, yeah, you're going to take the shoes off because you don't want to drive them through your feet.

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.200
Good point, Freddy.

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.840
OK, OK, thank you.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:32.360
It's important to be clear when delineating a task.

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:36.120
So, yeah, you want to take your shoes off.

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:39.960
Step one, step two, you drive the nails through the bottom of the shoes.

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.000
Step three, you got sticky shoes.

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:42.880
I love it.

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:46.360
And then I think we could walk through this house with more ease.

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:51.280
What if we also become like, what would an intestine not like?

01:23:51.320 --> 01:24:00.080
I could do some research on, but houses generally like to eat and then what they think is gross and then we become what is gross to them.

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.480
So it does not want to eat us.

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.000
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, guys.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.120
When when the body ingests something that is gross to it, it expels it.

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:13.520
So I don't think we want to be vomited out forcibly by this by this house.

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.640
So we want to be tasty?

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.360
I think we want to be I think we want to be as as as inconspicuous as possible.

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:24.040
Can a house be in devour?

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:27.400
This house is one hundred percent in devour.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:28.960
We know it just tried to eat you.

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.160
You heard it groaning and creaking as it happened.

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:31.560
Come on.

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:37.600
This is a disgusting boar house.

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:46.880
Uh, Scott, the Good Friends of Jackson Elias podcast is a podcast about vore gaming in general.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.480
Is that right?

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:52.280
Yeah, we wear our fetishes proud.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.640
Hungry, hungry hippos really changed your life.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:02.560
Oh, God.

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:10.720
So, yeah, if you're looking for nails to hammer through your shoes, if you poke around the

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:16.520
outside of the house a bit, you can find there are a couple of other outbuildings just

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:21.160
around the back. In fact, really just around the corner from where you are now that have

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:29.360
got all sorts of tools, a tool shed and a workshop that's obviously used for some

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:29.920
maintenance.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:30.320
Rope?

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:31.560
Rope. Hmm.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:34.920
I think this would be a good opportunity for a group luck roll.

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:39.720
Well, we can't.

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:41.240
Okay, Joe, come on.

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:41.640
Roll it.

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:43.320
Roll your luck, Joe.

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:44.200
You got it.

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.880
It's a, uh, oh, it's a eighty eight.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:53.440
Oh, wait, you can still crit fail.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.280
So there is some rope, but it is really badly rotted.

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:04.120
Do you think that it wouldn't stand any chance of supporting one of your weights?

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:07.240
Well, then it's a good thing there's a hose right here.

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.560
Yeah, I see it, too.

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.480
Yes, as long as that rubber hasn't perished, you'll be fine.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.920
But we'll save the luck roll on that one for when you're actually in trouble.

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:28.400
Perfect. I was just picturing the four of us all tied together like ice, like mountain

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:36.280
climbers with the hobnails in our shoes, our lifeline, which is this crackly dry hose.

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:43.200
And then just like any random tools, I think, uh, would be necessary.

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:43.840
Yeah.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:47.760
Hammers, saws, gasoline cutting implements in particular.

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:48.520
I think it'd be handy.

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:49.800
We could burn the house down.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:53.600
I'd like to see if there's a very long, a flat bladed screwdriver.

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:54.320
Yeah.

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.480
I mean that there are going to be screwdrivers here.

01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:58.040
I won't make you make a luck roll for that.

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:00.840
It's a workshop, there'll be screwdrivers.

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:06.680
As far as the gasoline's concerned, I mean, you do remember there were drums of diesel

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:08.400
out by the generator.

01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:08.960
That's right.

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:10.320
I actually, I mean, Dr.

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:17.120
Rothstein would probably know this just through having worked with stuff like this

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:17.640
before.

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:22.680
If you're looking to set a fire, diesel is a really shit thing to use.

01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:23.760
Yeah.

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:25.880
So I don't even mention it to the rest of the group.

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:29.360
If only we had some of that sweet, sweet, leaded gasoline around.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:32.000
A cup a day keeps the doctor away.

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:37.200
That's a joke because leaded tastes sweet and there wasn't unleaded gasoline yet.

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.200
So, oh dude, that was fucking weird.

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.240
Yes, it was.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.080
I knew Scott got it.

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:45.160
I just saw you guys like,

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:54.960
so now that you're all lashed together with perished hose and have nails through

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:58.000
your boots, what are you doing next?

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:03.920
Freddie, can you think back when you were being devoured, did you notice that was

01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:08.000
there any place in that house that wasn't fleshy?

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:10.520
Was there any hardwoods anywhere?

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.320
You saw what I saw.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:17.080
Just to give you some idea of what you saw just before you sort of started falling

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:21.240
through the floor, there were at least three other doors or at least three doors

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:23.360
rather in that room.

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:25.280
There was one that was ajar.

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.800
In fact, no, two of them were ajar, but two internal doors.

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.720
One of them seemed to go deeper within the house, possibly into a corridor.

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.320
And yeah, that looked almost as fleshy.

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:46.480
There was another door, which you reckon was just the back door leading outside.

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:49.640
We could just go through the back door.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:51.120
Yeah.

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:54.440
I guess we could just open that door and look inside and see what we think.

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.400
Sounds a lot less life threatening than our first approach.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:10.520
Uh, what order are we in and in our hose train?

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:13.360
Oh God, marching order, fuck sake.

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:16.400
Okay.

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.400
Well, someone's going to have to go in first.

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.200
It may as well be the one with foist in their name.

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:24.440
That's me.

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.520
I'm Frederick Mellon the foist.

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:25.800
Exactly.

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.560
I, uh, no objections.

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:31.000
But right now I feel more like Frederick Mellon the moist.

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:40.120
So just to be clear, you're going in through the back door.

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:41.960
You're, you're not going around the front.

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:42.360
Yeah.

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:46.720
I mean, opening up the back door again, isn't that difficult.

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:52.200
You do have to get the knife out and cut some of these strands of flesh away from

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:55.240
the door frame, but the door itself isn't locked.

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:59.640
And, you know, once again with a sort of squelching noise, you managed to pull it

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:06.400
open and yeah, inside you can see what do you now reckon must be the kitchen?

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:10.680
I mean, it's difficult to tell because, you know, every identifying bit of

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:14.680
furniture or surface or whatever is covered in flesh.

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:18.400
But as I said, there, there are two doors.

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:26.360
There's a sort of side door that looks like it may go to some steps down and then

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:30.960
there's another door that's going deeper into the house.

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.920
Yeah, actually, I mean, I forgot to do this for Dr.

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:34.640
Coombs earlier.

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:39.400
Now that the rest of you are there on the doorstep within the house, dealing with,

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:43.800
you know, everything, the sensory overload that this is providing.

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:47.480
I do want San rolls off the rest of you, everyone except for Freddy.

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:52.000
Three.

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.320
I failed a 40 on a 28.

01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:58.400
I passed.

01:30:58.560 --> 01:30:59.920
So is it just Dr.

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:03.840
Coombs who loses a D3 of San?

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:06.800
A two.

01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:13.760
So I think what the way this evidence is an involuntary action is, as the group

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:16.120
of you are stepping in, Dr.

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:20.680
Coombs is just there hesitating on the doorstep with the frayed hose suddenly

01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:23.200
getting pulled taut and creaking a bit.

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:28.040
You can see some of the cracks and getting that bit longer as he's just standing

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:32.000
there digging the nails of his shoes into this flesh.

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:37.000
I told you guys that I think this might be a digestive tract and you guys just want to

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:37.600
walk in.

01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:41.400
Well, but it seemed like he was getting digested down there on the floor, right?

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.840
This would be the upper part of the body.

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:47.040
I mean, essentially all the body just exists to support digestion.

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:51.720
So, you know, we're basically just a tube from our mouth to our asshole, but.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.760
That's what they taught us, correct?

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:57.840
Yeah, that's, that's what, that's what any doctor would tell you.

01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.040
Day one in medical school.

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:09.320
Listen, I understand you had a traumatic experience the last time you went to this

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:12.320
property, but we got the nails in our shoes now.

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:17.280
And I step a couple of times into the, into the floor to see if I slip.

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:20.760
You don't see no more slipping, no more sliding.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.440
We can maybe, unfortunately, I think we're going to have to go up to that fucking

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:27.880
creepy moist curtain and check out the light in that room.

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:31.960
But it seems like we have the tools to do that now without getting sucked in by the

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:33.920
floor. We got the hose.

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:35.480
We're all holding hands.

01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:37.640
They're just like kernels of corn.

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:41.880
We just go straight through, uh, unbothered.

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.720
That's exactly right, doctor.

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:47.960
I live my life by three rules and three rules only.

01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:52.960
Take chances, make mistakes, get messy.

01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:56.760
And I, I, my three rules are live, laugh, and love.

01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:00.160
And you got, it's just time to live, Dr.

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:03.000
Coombs. I love you.

01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:07.000
We're going to laugh about this later.

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:08.480
We're going to laugh about this later.

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:14.520
So I, I, I, I, I, uh, corn.

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:16.160
Sure. We're like, we're like corn.

01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:19.520
Yeah. We'll go on. That's the one that works for Tracer food.

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:21.120
Yeah, of course. I like that one.

01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:29.240
Okay. And with that, you start heading in.

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:34.240
So you're going through into, yeah, this little

01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:39.000
corridor that's got a door on the other side, uh, and then

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000
seems to go round to your left.

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:43.040
I continue.

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:46.040
Yeah. If you're following the corridor around on your,

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:51.760
Oh, perfect.

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.840
Zach has changed his background.

01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:56.280
Zoom background. Yeah.

01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:58.440
To the magic school bus inside the human body.

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:03.040
Take chances, make mistakes, get messy.

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:08.960
I, as you're following the corridor around, the walls are

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:13.520
getting less flashy around here, but the carpet is still

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.400
very, very moist here.

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:21.080
There's still a kind of constant, as you're walking

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:26.280
across it and you come across and you can see, you know, in

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:29.840
the few lights that are coming around that to your left is

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:33.600
probably the ruins of an old conservatory round to the

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:39.320
right is the sort of main entrance with staircases up the

01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:43.200
ruins, the front door and doorways to a couple of other

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:44.400
interior rooms.

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:49.040
Can we do another, like gauging the sound and everything, just

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.720
taking our surroundings one more time around here.

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:52.360
So if there's anything that's changed, another word for

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:52.760
deeper in.

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:56.760
Yeah. In fact, if each one of you wants to give me a, I'll

01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:59.400
tell you what, I'll let you choose either a listener, a spot

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:02.600
hidden role, they'll tell you different things.

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:10.680
I'm taking a spot hidden and I failed a 35 on a 25.

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:12.080
Failed.

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.160
I got a nine on a spot hidden.

01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:19.640
I did a hard success on a listen.

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:20.040
Okay.

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.360
So you pick up two different things.

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:27.960
What Thomas feels is, yeah, there is movement of the air in

01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:28.760
the house.

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:33.360
Uh, for a moment you thought it was like a breeze coming in

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:37.480
through the front door, but it's not that, that the movement

01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:42.200
of the air seems to change direction on a slow, regular

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.040
basis.

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:47.960
Like, like, um, like breath?

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:48.960
Hmm.

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:51.200
Something like that.

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:59.680
What, uh, what Freddie notices with his listen role is that,

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:02.200
yeah, it's like what you heard earlier.

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:10.120
There is a sound coming from upstairs, a sort of rasping,

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:11.520
groaning sound.

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:14.640
I mean, it's difficult to discern because it's so low.

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.800
Uh, it's almost infrasound.

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.560
It's rumbling through the house.

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:22.800
But you, you reckon it is originating upstairs.

01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:26.440
I mean, I think we got to go upstairs to that flush curtain room.

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:30.600
If we've learned one thing, so when you enter a house and you

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:33.840
hear something upstairs, you got to go up to the bedroom and

01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:36.840
kill the sleeping occupant, you got to go up to the bedroom and

01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:37.880
kill the sleeping occupant.

01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:38.480
Yes, exactly.

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:39.440
That's what tonight is tonight.

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:47.720
Do we, do we feel like that worked at will for us last time?

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:51.040
Is that, is that the, I thought this is, we're standing on there.

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:51.600
Okay, gotcha.

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:52.800
He's dead, isn't he?

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:57.960
Is this something like, uh, is this a saying that there is or, um, yeah.

01:36:58.400 --> 01:36:58.760
Yeah.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.240
Ah, I've not heard that one.

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:01.560
You're not from around here.

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:02.320
Don't worry about it.

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.320
Yes, I agree.

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:08.440
It's just like, what they say, kill the sleeping.

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:16.880
Okay.

01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:17.800
Oh, okay.

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:22.840
Well, with, with, uh, with a song in your heart and murder on your mind,

01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:24.840
you make your way up the stairs.

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:30.960
We got this guys.

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:33.880
Yeah.

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:34.720
Is your fiddle wet?

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:37.880
Yeah.

01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.880
Can I give us Bardic inspiration?

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:48.520
Well, again, the carpet, the stairs going up is, is moist.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.200
Uh, and when you get up to the landing, there are a few doors.

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:58.600
I mean, there's, you've got short corridors going off on other side, but you're fairly

01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:03.720
certain, you know, off the back of the rolls you made earlier, that the main movement of

01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:07.640
the air is coming through the double doors of what you assume is the master bedroom

01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:08.720
directly in front of you.

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:09.440
All right.

01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:16.160
On the backs of the rolls that we had earlier, I'm fairly certain that the air is

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:20.840
pushing in and out through these double doors, which is likely the master bedroom.

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:22.480
This is my whisper.

01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:24.760
So we're all keeping our voices down.

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:29.400
We're going to all go in two by two, right?

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.120
Double doors.

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:31.320
It can fit two by two.

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:34.400
So I say we push in double doors wide open.

01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:36.320
We can all, we can all just rest for that.

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:43.560
It's two doors, wide open, two doors, four men, one rush, doors down.

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:48.800
What would Neil put do is what I'm trying to say.

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:50.360
Die.

01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:53.200
He was sleeping.

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:54.080
All right.

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:57.200
So we'll let's, um, let's rush in there.

01:38:57.320 --> 01:38:57.760
Okay.

01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:58.960
You rush in.

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:03.800
There is a single flickering light in the ceiling here.

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:11.520
It's not giving off much light and yeah, it keeps cutting out.

01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:16.120
Obviously the moisture has got into the works and it's just flickering on and off.

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:25.640
But you can make out that there, again, the walls here are disturbingly fleshy.

01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:28.120
It's not the same color.

01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:33.160
It doesn't look like the same kind of tissue as you saw downstairs.

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.920
It's, it's something different.

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.360
It's pulsating.

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:48.000
There is on the far wall, this, well, I guess the only word for it is orifice, this

01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:53.960
pulsating hole in the wall, this large hole, and you can see something

01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:56.840
worm-like moving around inside it.

01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:58.480
How big?

01:39:58.640 --> 01:39:59.480
Huge.

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:01.840
I mean, like larger than any one of you.

01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:06.560
Does it look like it's sticking out like a tongue or it's not sticking out

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:11.800
entirely, but yeah, now that your mind has made the connection with the

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:15.240
tongue, that is absolutely a tongue.

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:17.040
You see what I'm saying, boys?

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.120
Mouth to asshole.

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:19.600
That's all we are.

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.280
That's all this monster house is.

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:26.600
And I think, I think that is a good chance for another sand roll here,

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:33.520
particularly here at that point, you can hear this rumbling sound

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:35.440
coming out of the hole.

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.880
I got an 88.

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:40.320
I got a 94.

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:48.280
The rumbling sound coming out of the hole seems to be saying Rothstein.

01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:50.800
Oh shit.

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:54.480
I'm fucking sorry, Carl.

01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:57.440
Are you acquainted with this goddamn monster house?

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.320
Did anyone pass their sand roll?

01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:03.240
Okay.

01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:05.440
So each one of you loses a D6 of sand.

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:10.320
Oh my God.

01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:12.920
I rolled a big old sixers.

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.480
I got a six as well.

01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:16.360
I got a four.

01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:18.480
And what about Freddie?

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:19.480
Oh, I passed.

01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:20.880
I got a 19 on my sand check.

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:21.640
Oh, you passed.

01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:23.880
So, so, so you still lose one.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:24.360
Okay.

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:24.840
Okay.

01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:26.280
For the two of you who lost six.

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.120
Can I have intelligence rolls please?

01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:31.560
I failed that one.

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:33.440
Also a 65 on a 60.

01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:35.360
I passed 37 on a 70.

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:35.760
Dr.

01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:39.560
Coombes failed, so you failed your intelligence roll.

01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:40.200
That's good.

01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:41.720
You're not having a bad and madness.

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:42.800
Dr.

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:47.080
Rothstein on the other hand is, I think, you know, that makes sense.

01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:47.960
Total sense.

01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:48.920
I heard your name.

01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:52.400
I think at that point, Dr.

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:57.920
Rothstein in blind panic runs, just runs out of the room.

01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:04.360
Suddenly that rope that you've got is, well, rather the hose is stretched taut.

01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:09.000
And well, we've already established you're not going to pass a group luck roll here.

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:12.080
So that's the point at which it just snaps.

01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:15.760
This frayed rubber just, just snaps completely.

01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:22.960
And the rest of you, as you stumble and fall as this jerks, just lose Rothstein

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:26.280
as he runs off somewhere within the house.

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.400
You don't see where he's gone.

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:38.000
From a role-playing perspective, we would definitely want to go after him.

01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:43.200
But from a game, gamey perspective where we are trapped inside this

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:44.880
monster house that wants to eat us.

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:49.480
Uh, I don't know.

01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:52.240
Yeah.

01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:53.200
What's the answer there?

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:53.920
Cause I don't know.

01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:57.480
Well, I don't want to say what I'm nevermind.

01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:58.200
Fuck him.

01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:01.200
I don't want to give Luke or the DM any ideas.

01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:03.840
So I'm not going to continue my sentence.

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:05.720
Holy shit.

01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:07.080
We got to get them boys.

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:15.560
Coombs, I think is, is distracted through all this by the fact that the mouth,

01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:18.680
the wall tongue mouth has just spoken.

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:24.760
And he's going to kind of look wide-eyed at it and say, you, you can, you can, you

01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:26.280
can talk, you can talk.

01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:37.600
And the voice again, just that it takes a deep breath in that just moves all the

01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:42.960
air suddenly quite fast through the room around you enough to ruffle your hair.

01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:46.640
This time, it just says a bit louder.

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:54.560
Rothstein, help me.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.560
How, how can, how can Rothstein help you?

01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:00.800
We got it.

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.000
We got to get Carl back in here.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.400
He, he could help.

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:06.840
It sounds like, well, I think you're doing a great job right now talking to the,

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.360
you know, whole house.

01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:14.080
So like, uh, that's definitely, uh, Austin Hawks, right?

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:16.760
Like Sedgwick turned Hawks into a fucking house.

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:21.200
So let's, uh, keep talking to them, I guess.

01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:22.480
And let's get some answers.

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:25.920
Are you, did you hear that house house mouth?

01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:28.240
That's are you, are you Austin?

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:31.680
I'm less worried about if you're Austin Hawks and I'm more worried

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:32.960
about how we can help you.

01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:33.840
That too.

01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:34.120
Yep.

01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:36.160
I'd like to know the answer to both, please.

01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:37.720
But you're talking so slow.

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:38.800
I think we don't have time.

01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:39.160
Maybe.

01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:42.640
And again, it's after another deep breath.

01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:51.000
It just goes Rothstein and this time the walls shake.

01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:51.800
All right.

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:52.040
All right.

01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:52.360
We'll get them.

01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:52.720
We'll get them.

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:53.080
We'll get them.

01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:53.400
Hang on.

01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:53.760
Hang on.

01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:55.840
Carl.

01:44:58.480 --> 01:44:59.000
Okay.

01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:02.640
Uh, can I have a luck roll for Dr.

01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:03.680
Rothstein please?

01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:06.160
A 94.

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:08.040
So I fail.

01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:09.680
Okay.

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:17.920
So yeah, you basically at this stage, obviously just running off the memory

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:25.600
you had run back out through the way you came back in, but in your panic, you have

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:28.080
clearly forgotten about that hole in the floor.

01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:32.240
Oh no.

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.280
Yes.

01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:37.920
So you sort of come out of your, your fugue state.

01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:39.040
Yeah.

01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:45.040
As, as your foot just goes down through this hole and you're off balance, you've

01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:51.320
gone down, you slammed your face down into this pulsating, warm flesh at the floor.

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:57.040
And again, you're in a very similar situation that Freddie was earlier of

01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:59.800
just beginning to slip down this hole.

01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:08.840
Down below, you can hear this, as well as this horrible smell, you can hear just

01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:14.520
this dripping liquid and the sound of liquid moving around and you can give me

01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:18.600
a listen roll as well, just to see whether you can pick up something else.

01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:21.720
Fail.

01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:23.160
33 on a 20.

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:26.480
No, you can, you can hear, you can hear it.

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.360
Like I say, liquid moving around.

01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:29.760
Spend your luck.

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:31.720
Uh, not yet.

01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:32.960
I'm not going to spend my luck yet.

01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:36.320
Yeah.

01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:39.280
Don't spend your luck while you're being eaten alive by the house.

01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:41.840
Not for a listen roll.

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:48.680
On the other hand, I mean, you can hear that there is something else down there.

01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:52.080
I mean, yeah, maybe if you just let yourself slide down a bit further, you

01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:57.960
could push the roll and get a better listen.

01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:58.320
Yep.

01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:02.800
No, a 35 on a 20 this time.

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:04.360
Oh, okay.

01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:06.880
Oh my God, you idiot.

01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:08.640
I love you.

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:11.240
This makes me so happy.

01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:17.240
So in the process of doing that, there is suddenly, I mean, you put your head

01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:23.160
underneath and yeah, you do actually at that point hear what it is that you were

01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:29.000
struggling to, which is just the sound of someone crying.

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:36.040
It sounds like a little girl crying somewhere inside, somewhere down below.

01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:42.040
And, and yeah, I mean, as you strain your head down just to get a better, a better

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:47.800
lock on where she is, that's the point at which just the remaining bit of the floor

01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:52.040
holding you up collapses and you fall down into darkness.

01:47:52.320 --> 01:48:01.400
Yeah, this is a real Hannah Montana moment for me because I really wanted to know

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:04.640
what was down there, but I really didn't want Frederick Millen the first to fall

01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:09.000
down there and I really got the best of both worlds out of this.

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:14.200
I, the whole time I'm like, I don't, I'm not familiar with Hannah Montana enough

01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:19.680
to, I was like, you really brought it together at the end there.

01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:24.440
And really at the, uh, with a story like this, it's not about, uh, how fast you get

01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:27.840
there or what's waiting on the other side, but it's the climb.

01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.240
I think this house needs a wrecking ball.

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:39.960
A party in the USA.

01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:49.880
You can't knock down the worst big old vore house in Crawley.

01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:54.120
Her godmother's Dolly Parton.

01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:55.040
Okay.

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:57.240
I was wondering where we got to Dolly.

01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:03.120
I was like, are we just saying things associated with musicians?

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:38.360
How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
