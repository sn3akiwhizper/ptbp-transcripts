00:00.000 --> 00:08.160
My producer just handed me a note, just a content warning up front on this one for my wolf pups.

00:08.160 --> 00:16.000
Caution, these boys have done some fucked up shit on this show, but this is perhaps a bit more intense.

00:16.000 --> 00:24.400
If you or anyone you know are dealing with suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

00:24.400 --> 00:29.200
1-800-273-8255.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.520
Take care of yourself, y'all.

00:33.760 --> 00:38.880
Bonjour, my beautiful, bountiful, bouncing baby babies.

00:38.880 --> 00:44.800
Papa Wolf is here to cradle you to sleep with my soothing grumbles and growls.

00:44.800 --> 00:53.440
As always, I am lulling y'all to your dream states live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:53.680 --> 00:59.440
I just want to let y'all know, it's December 6th, and it is the night time.

00:59.440 --> 01:06.320
The good numbers of 6.9 and 4.2 are here to smear me and smear.

01:06.320 --> 01:10.160
That's that good cream, the sweet cream.

01:10.160 --> 01:14.880
When I get all lathered up in cream, y'all know what time it is.

01:14.880 --> 01:18.880
It's Howlin' with Wolf O'Clock, daddios and momios.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.680
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Dustin,

01:21.680 --> 01:25.200
who tagged that pretending pod in a tweet that read,

01:25.200 --> 01:29.200
A stoner, a Jedi, and a surgeon walkin' to a bar.

01:29.760 --> 01:33.040
Blunt. Force. Trauma.

01:33.040 --> 01:37.760
Hell yeah. Jesus Christ. Good job, Dustin.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.960
Dustin writes, Salutations, Wolf.

01:40.960 --> 01:48.080
Dustin the Wind here, from Toledo, Ohio, aka the armpit of the Midwest.

01:48.080 --> 01:53.520
I'm new to the saga of contention, but after my first listen,

01:53.520 --> 01:56.960
I'm made like Muse and plugged in baby.

01:56.960 --> 02:01.440
Now I'm all cut up on the backlog and hungry for more.

02:01.440 --> 02:05.760
Just like I'm hungry for the taste sensation that's sweeping the nation.

02:05.760 --> 02:09.040
Food Witch, now with extra flavor.

02:09.040 --> 02:11.680
What flavor? I'll never tell.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.440
Try one and find out.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.600
Food Witch, it's edible.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.520
Brought to you by Bar Corp.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.800
The only magic we make is the illusion of choice.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.640
Well, hello, Mr. De Wind.

02:24.640 --> 02:32.560
The only processed foods I want are the ones that have been processed by the stew of garbage juice.

02:32.560 --> 02:36.480
And by processed, I mean mostly rotted.

02:36.480 --> 02:40.000
Maybe add a little MSG and sugar to it.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.960
But I'd be willing to try some Food Witch,

02:42.960 --> 02:46.800
if you'd be willing to send me a couple of dumpsters full of them.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.400
I just need that fresh from the dumpster flavor.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.280
Dumpster to table cuisine, babies.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.000
What's that?

02:54.000 --> 02:58.400
You want the opportunity to write up a message for a Wolfie to Hal?

02:58.400 --> 03:00.240
It's so easy.

03:00.960 --> 03:06.000
Just write something nice about us on the internet and tag at PretendingPod.

03:06.000 --> 03:06.720
What's that?

03:06.720 --> 03:09.840
You don't follow us on Instagram or Twitter?

03:09.840 --> 03:10.880
What the fuck?

03:11.840 --> 03:19.440
We post cool shit on there like maps and fan art and pics of Zach's adorable cats Ramona and RoPo.

03:19.440 --> 03:20.560
What's that?

03:20.560 --> 03:27.520
You've listened to over 60 episodes of the show and you still haven't written a five-star review on Apple Podcasts?

03:27.520 --> 03:29.280
That's wild, my babies.

03:29.280 --> 03:33.440
I'm talking to the vast majority of you, but on the real.

03:33.440 --> 03:34.880
Thanks for listening, y'all.

03:34.880 --> 03:39.280
I fucking love making this show just for you.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.240
And guess what?

03:40.240 --> 03:51.920
All five of those pretending to be people stinkers are going to be on Twitch for a night of goofy buffoonery on Tuesday, February 11th at 7 p.m. Central Time.

03:51.920 --> 03:56.240
That's twitch.tv slash pretending pod streams.

03:56.240 --> 03:59.440
Find a link in these here show notes.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.760
Tuesday, February 11th at 7 p.m. Central Time.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.160
Who knows what they'll get up to?

04:06.160 --> 04:07.920
Maybe some Jackbox?

04:07.920 --> 04:09.520
There's only five of them.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.480
Leave some room for y'all to hop in on the action.

04:12.480 --> 04:15.040
Oh, that's going to be fun.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.320
OK, y'all, I got good news and bad news.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.200
Just kidding.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.440
I'm all out of good news.

04:21.440 --> 04:29.360
Last time, our intrepid assholes made their way across campus to Glass Hall, where the biology lab is located.

04:29.360 --> 04:40.080
On the way, they saw unmarked black helicopters in the sky, as well as a couple of goners who were performing some stomach turning acts nasty.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.720
And that ain't wolf the dog nasty.

04:42.720 --> 04:47.360
They made it down to the basement of Glass Hall right outside the lab.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.040
But they're fucking losing it.

04:49.040 --> 04:52.160
And Clark Clark started chanting.

04:52.160 --> 04:56.400
Let's give him something with a little rhythm to spice up that towel.

04:56.400 --> 05:22.800
Well, hey there, Joe.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.560
Hey, Zachariah.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.280
Did anything happen at the end of last episode?

05:27.280 --> 05:28.400
No, I don't think so.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.360
No, nothing important?

05:29.360 --> 05:30.080
Nothing I remember.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.520
That makes a lot of sense.

05:31.520 --> 05:35.680
What I remember is that you lost your fucking mind.

05:35.680 --> 05:41.680
Zero Sand started chanting and then took a big ass finger bump out of Keith's cocaine finger.

05:42.560 --> 05:42.800
Yup.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.920
So what are you expecting for this evening?

05:45.920 --> 05:50.320
I brought my Nintendo Switch because I think I'm going to be not in this episode much at all time.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.080
What are you going to play?

05:54.080 --> 05:55.920
I got Stardew Valley over there.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.240
I never played it before and I've heard it's real addicting.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.760
Is it like Star Wars?

05:59.760 --> 06:00.480
I don't know what...

06:00.480 --> 06:01.360
No, you farm.

06:01.920 --> 06:02.720
You're a farmer.

06:02.720 --> 06:07.040
So it's like what Star Wars would have been about if Ben Kenobi would have never shown up.

06:07.040 --> 06:07.440
Exactly.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.720
If Luke had just stayed on the farm.

06:10.560 --> 06:16.400
Well, what we're going to do is I'm going to give you your objective for the evening.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.480
And we'll start with that.

06:18.480 --> 06:23.360
So first off, you are going to be chanting when we begin.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.160
When everyone comes back in the room all together.

06:26.160 --> 06:26.720
Okay.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.480
So go ahead and just give me like a little example of what that might sound like.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.360
Remember it's towel alacle.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.400
Towel alacle.

06:34.400 --> 06:34.720
Yeah.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.360
That's what it is.

06:35.360 --> 06:35.840
Yeah.

06:35.840 --> 06:36.800
Towel alacle.

06:37.520 --> 06:38.240
Am I doing it right?

06:38.240 --> 06:39.520
Towel alacle.

06:39.520 --> 06:39.840
Yeah.

06:39.840 --> 06:40.000
Yeah.

06:43.360 --> 06:47.200
And then you don't have to do that the whole time because that would be annoying.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.400
And I can just do that in post.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.040
You can lay it in.

06:49.040 --> 06:49.280
Yeah.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.680
So we'll get a clean take of that.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.200
Actually, let's get a clean take of it now.

06:55.840 --> 06:56.800
Oh, a clean take.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.000
A clean take.

06:58.000 --> 06:58.480
Yeah.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.720
As opposed to what you were wanting to do there.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.160
Towel alacle.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.440
Towel alacle.

07:05.440 --> 07:06.880
Towel alacle.

07:06.880 --> 07:07.920
Towel alacle.

07:07.920 --> 07:08.640
Perfect.

07:09.280 --> 07:12.160
Oh, you make an insane person look good, Joe.

07:13.920 --> 07:14.960
My dad always told me that.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
So next I'm going to have you roll a d4.

07:18.960 --> 07:19.520
Okay.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.560
I got a two.

07:22.560 --> 07:22.800
Okay.

07:23.520 --> 07:29.360
You are going to start trying desperately to kill yourself in two rounds.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.960
So let's call it the third round.

07:30.960 --> 07:36.800
So you have two rounds of just chanting and like maybe moving about and kind of finding

07:36.800 --> 07:38.640
what you're going to use to kill yourself.

07:38.640 --> 07:42.400
And then on that third round, you're going to go ahead and really try to make that a

07:42.400 --> 07:44.080
reality by going through with it.

07:44.960 --> 07:45.280
Okay.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.920
But I have to do it.

07:47.920 --> 07:48.720
You have to do it.

07:48.720 --> 07:52.400
But I mean like, what happens if I get to the third round and I haven't like prepared

07:52.400 --> 07:54.640
well enough, is there a penalty or something?

07:54.640 --> 07:55.440
How does that work?

07:55.440 --> 07:58.800
Because theoretically the guys are going to hopefully try to stop me from doing something.

07:58.800 --> 07:59.520
Exactly.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.920
So just do your best.

08:01.920 --> 08:06.400
And then if you can't do to them, good on them.

08:06.400 --> 08:11.200
However, if you can't not do to them, I'm going to force your hand.

08:11.200 --> 08:11.440
Sure.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.680
Or just, you know, I'd prefer that you do it.

08:16.960 --> 08:17.200
Yeah.

08:18.720 --> 08:19.840
Thanks for giving me agency.

08:19.840 --> 08:20.560
Exactly.

08:21.520 --> 08:28.560
I'm giving you the full reign of motion, full range of motion, but you have to kill yourself.

08:28.560 --> 08:28.960
Yeah.

08:28.960 --> 08:29.520
No problem.

08:29.520 --> 08:33.200
I've never said that to anyone before and I don't like the way it feels in my mouth.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.240
No, I don't care for it.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.920
They're going to use this recording in my trial.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.120
I fucking know it.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.320
Oh, God damn it.

08:41.280 --> 08:41.680
Okay.

08:41.680 --> 08:45.440
So with that all being said, are you ready?

08:45.440 --> 08:47.680
I assume I need to be cagey with the fellas, right?

08:47.680 --> 08:48.480
I believe so.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.320
Is it possible for Clark to speak other than tell a local at this point?

08:52.320 --> 08:53.040
Not at this point.

08:53.040 --> 08:53.840
Okay, cool.

08:53.840 --> 08:54.480
Uh, okay.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.120
We'll see what happens.

08:55.120 --> 09:06.320
Here we go.

09:13.840 --> 09:14.560
Oh, Hey Luke.

09:15.280 --> 09:15.760
That's me.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.920
That's my sign.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.080
Is there like a, what's it called?

09:20.080 --> 09:22.480
Sign on call something.

09:22.480 --> 09:22.640
Yeah.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.840
It's called a sign on call or something or something.

09:25.840 --> 09:26.560
What's up, man?

09:26.560 --> 09:27.600
An image.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.080
You did something at the end of the last episode, didn't you?

09:30.080 --> 09:30.640
I did.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.080
You busted something out.

09:32.080 --> 09:36.880
I busted some lines like a poet.

09:36.880 --> 09:37.440
Yes.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.560
Like a beat.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.800
Like slam poetry.

09:40.800 --> 09:46.160
Cocaine in my brain until I'm insane.

09:47.040 --> 09:47.680
That's pretty good.

09:48.640 --> 09:49.760
Self opinion.

09:49.760 --> 09:50.080
Okay.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.720
So yes, I did.

09:54.720 --> 10:00.480
I've been waiting for a moment to use it and I was like, fuck, this is good as any, I guess.

10:01.520 --> 10:08.080
So there's going to be some positives for using that, but the negative is that you lose 10 luck.

10:08.080 --> 10:08.400
Right.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.000
So you had how much luck?

10:10.000 --> 10:16.160
I had 35 and before you tell me that I have five points, let me say this, because I used

10:16.160 --> 10:20.560
it in succession so quickly, let's call it one.

10:20.560 --> 10:21.040
I agree.

10:21.680 --> 10:22.240
Hell yeah.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.240
So you have 25 luck still.

10:24.240 --> 10:24.880
Tight, tight.

10:25.440 --> 10:29.760
Also using it, I remembered when I first got it, there was a reason that I hadn't used

10:29.760 --> 10:31.920
it, but I forgot what the cost was.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.680
So I was just hoping that it wasn't like something terrible.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.600
So the cost is that 10 luck.

10:37.600 --> 10:42.720
And normally the positive that you would get is that it puts your willpower back up to

10:42.720 --> 10:43.360
full.

10:43.360 --> 10:48.240
However, during this arc, we haven't been using the willpower because I'm still at 10

10:48.240 --> 10:50.800
out of 10 because I forgot about it.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.680
Well, you're such a good GM.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.840
I would, I, you haven't forgot about it.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.520
You just are waiting for the right time.

10:57.520 --> 10:58.400
Exactly.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.920
Thank you for understanding.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.920
So basically what we're going to do is with that, like kick of Coke up in the nostrils,

11:05.920 --> 11:11.680
I will give you a boon later in this episode for using a bonus.

11:12.480 --> 11:12.880
Okay.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.360
Tight.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.760
Same for me and Clark and John.

11:15.760 --> 11:16.480
Absolutely.

11:16.480 --> 11:17.360
Fuck you.

11:17.360 --> 11:18.560
Justin's character.

11:18.560 --> 11:19.920
Donovan West.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.520
Why can't we remember that?

11:21.520 --> 11:23.360
You don't even remember his last name, do you?

11:23.360 --> 11:28.480
West view, West Haven, West Haven, something like that.

11:28.480 --> 11:28.880
Sorry.

11:28.880 --> 11:29.040
Sorry.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.400
Sorry, Justin.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.200
We'll care about your next character.

11:33.200 --> 11:42.400
So just a reminder, before we get into tonight's episode, you have a pile of money in your

11:42.400 --> 11:44.640
pockets and at your feet.

11:44.640 --> 11:45.680
And you're very excited.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.120
I'm so excited.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.240
I'm giving away my drugs.

11:48.240 --> 11:48.560
I'm sorry.

11:48.560 --> 11:49.600
Cause I can buy more.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.480
Exactly.

11:50.480 --> 11:50.800
All right.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.360
Let's get the other boys in here and kick this thing off.

11:59.040 --> 12:11.120
What's the loudest fart you've ever heard?

12:11.120 --> 12:12.000
I don't know.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.120
Nothing really sticks out.

12:13.120 --> 12:13.440
It does.

12:13.440 --> 12:14.400
Nothing has to stick out.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.040
It could just be a fart.

12:17.040 --> 12:17.600
What about you?

12:18.480 --> 12:19.040
I don't know.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.160
That's a weird thing to remember.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.280
Why would anybody remember that?

12:21.280 --> 12:22.080
That's what I'm thinking.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.440
Has anyone had any weird dreams recently?

12:25.440 --> 12:25.920
Thomas?

12:27.040 --> 12:27.200
Yeah.

12:27.840 --> 12:33.520
As a matter of fact, I was just telling some close friends about this weird dream.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.440
I had in our pre-interview.

12:38.560 --> 12:39.360
Is that what they're called?

12:41.760 --> 12:48.960
You really should start treating us like, like, so, uh, you got anything from your life?

12:48.960 --> 12:50.160
Any anecdotes you want to tell?

12:50.160 --> 12:52.480
If not, some of our writers can punch something up for you.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.920
No, but I did have a really weird dream.

12:56.560 --> 13:01.920
Probably doesn't mean anything, but I, a doctor told me to cut off my penis.

13:03.200 --> 13:03.920
Here's the deal.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.520
I was like, Oh, I had this dream.

13:05.520 --> 13:09.280
I went into the doctor because I was having like, I was like, I think there's something

13:09.280 --> 13:10.160
wrong with my penis.

13:10.720 --> 13:14.560
And the doctor's like, yeah, but it's common.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.920
I'm really busy.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.880
Here's some snips.

13:17.440 --> 13:23.040
You're going to cut off the end of your penis, the head and some of the shaft.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.880
Good to use all the scientific terms.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.320
He didn't.

13:26.320 --> 13:29.440
He just like, this is, um, he pointed at it.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.120
He actually said ding dong.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.320
He said, ding dong, but he's the Latin.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.200
He's like, yeah, I don't have time.

13:37.200 --> 13:42.800
You've got to cut off the tip of your penis, put it in this plastic bag and, uh, carry

13:42.800 --> 13:44.880
it around until your appointment tomorrow.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.840
So he made me do that myself.

13:48.640 --> 13:53.440
And as I was logging out the door, he's like, by the way, by the way, don't pee for 24 hours.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.560
And I was like, fuck.

13:56.480 --> 14:01.600
So I probably just had to pee because the rest of the dream was me managing, like just

14:01.600 --> 14:02.720
running into people in life.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.960
And they're like, wait, why do you have your penis in a bag?

14:05.600 --> 14:08.480
And then also I just had this like open penis sore.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.480
And then I really had to pee and I was like, he told me not to.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.480
I was like, but I can probably get away with it.

14:16.480 --> 14:23.600
So I peed and just like blood and piss came out, but there was no like pee muscles.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.800
It was just an open hole.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.720
So it just kind of sprayed everywhere.

14:28.320 --> 14:33.200
I like when you put your thumb over a hose, I thought you were going to say when you put

14:33.200 --> 14:38.000
your thumb over the tip of your penis, just to make the stream stronger.

14:38.960 --> 14:44.400
Well, when you're rinsing off like some chicken grease or something, you got to really some

14:44.480 --> 14:46.000
chicken grease from where?

14:46.000 --> 14:46.880
You know where.

14:46.880 --> 14:51.040
Speaking of taking home stuff from the hospital, Luke, have you seen anything interesting on

14:51.040 --> 14:52.000
Reddit recently?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.360
Well, I saw it on Facebook.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.000
A friend shared it to another friend.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.440
Way to turn your back on me.

14:58.880 --> 14:59.200
What?

14:59.200 --> 15:01.920
Just say you saw it on Reddit because that's what I asked, Luke.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.280
All right, I saw it on Reddit.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.720
A guy in Oklahoma got in a motorcycle crash.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.840
You're a liar, Luke.

15:09.520 --> 15:12.400
He crushed his foot and so they had to amputate it.

15:12.480 --> 15:18.560
Then he asked if he could keep it and he did and then he fed it to his friends in the form

15:18.560 --> 15:19.200
of tacos.

15:20.560 --> 15:23.680
He didn't feed it to his friends.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.200
He had a dinner party.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.120
He had a dinner party with tacos.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.480
Yeah, feet tacos.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.200
Foot meat.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.560
Inspired by our podcast.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.080
Oh shit, I didn't even make that connection.

15:34.720 --> 15:35.200
Wow.

15:35.200 --> 15:42.160
So we want to shout out to our officially number one superfan out there in Oklahoma.

15:42.400 --> 15:42.880
You get it.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.320
He gets it.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.600
Hopping around just like Keith.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.200
I also had a dream.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.200
Wait, no, no, no, no.

15:49.200 --> 15:53.680
Far more interested in whether or not you would eat your own flesh if you had the opportunity.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.600
Honestly, when else are you going to get that chance?

15:56.240 --> 15:56.800
Sure.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.240
I would ask you guys.

15:58.240 --> 16:01.760
I wouldn't be mad if you said no, but I'd be appreciative if you did.

16:01.760 --> 16:02.160
You know what?

16:02.160 --> 16:03.920
I would eat me, but I would not eat you.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.200
I would eat me, but I don't think I'd eat foot.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.400
Like if I lost my leg, I think I'd eat some calf meat.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.600
You can't really be picky.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.360
That's what, no, I think cannibals can't be choosers.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.520
I think I actually can in this instance.

16:17.520 --> 16:24.720
I'm going to choose not to eat any part of myself unless it's the right part.

16:24.720 --> 16:29.600
Honestly, you should have, instead of getting your penis tip reattached, just fed it to us.

16:29.600 --> 16:33.120
Well, I woke up before the penis actually got reattached.

16:33.120 --> 16:38.240
So there's a possibility that in some alternate reality where Thomas got like 30 more minutes

16:38.240 --> 16:41.680
of sleep, you all got to enjoy my dream penis.

16:42.480 --> 16:47.600
My dream penis, which is what I call my penis in real life.

16:49.440 --> 16:52.320
You don't have to detach it yet for us to enjoy it.

16:55.440 --> 17:04.160
Anyway, so you should start with Luke telling his story and completely cut out the part

17:04.160 --> 17:09.520
where I talk about the dick cutting off dream and just let them decide what that's all about.

17:10.880 --> 17:11.440
I won't.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.560
So you guys are all in the basement of glass hall.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.240
Your penis?

17:18.240 --> 17:21.440
Dude, it goes on for like three and a half minutes.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.280
It depends on the mode of...

17:23.280 --> 17:26.560
So you guys are all in the basement of glass hall, right outside the lab.

17:26.560 --> 17:32.160
And you have recently walked down some stairs that were covered in blood with loose screwdrivers,

17:32.160 --> 17:38.960
all strewn about on the stairwell leading down into the hallway that the lab is in.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.520
The lab's just up here on your right, as Donovan might say.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.800
Donovan, what's your last name?

17:42.800 --> 17:43.920
I'll let you guess.

17:43.920 --> 17:44.420
Elizabeth.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.240
View?

17:46.240 --> 17:46.800
West Haven.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.560
You had it right earlier.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.920
I said it right earlier.

17:49.920 --> 17:51.280
And then I told him, I don't think that's it.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.720
Have you never written it down?

17:53.680 --> 17:56.480
It's probably written down like eight times somewhere.

17:56.480 --> 17:57.520
Did he make it up?

17:59.120 --> 18:00.240
Yeah, who made the character name?

18:00.240 --> 18:02.880
Did you get to make your name up, Justin, or did he give you your name?

18:02.880 --> 18:04.000
I didn't give him his name.

18:04.000 --> 18:04.480
Okay.

18:04.480 --> 18:05.840
Zach doesn't tell me to do shit.

18:06.640 --> 18:07.440
Hey, that's right.

18:07.600 --> 18:11.440
Zach was like, if you want to spoil all the story stuff, go for it.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.480
That's essentially what I said.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.920
But I can't, because I don't know what's happening.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.800
Zach's told you at length what was going on in the campaign, but it was just too boring.

18:23.760 --> 18:24.720
Didn't pay attention.

18:24.720 --> 18:25.600
Cool story, Zach.

18:26.720 --> 18:27.200
Ouch.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.400
That was Justin saying that in the past when you told him that story.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.760
I was like, good job, Zach.

18:31.760 --> 18:32.640
I love you.

18:32.640 --> 18:35.040
But he said it really sarcastically, so it hurt worse.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.160
Than if you'd said cool story.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.240
Good job, Zach.

18:40.240 --> 18:41.040
I love you.

18:42.480 --> 18:45.600
And he's just holding up his fingers crossed right in front of Zach's face.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.120
Oh my God.

18:49.680 --> 18:56.400
Dude, the way you held your hand annoyingly in front of a face just looks like you have

18:56.400 --> 18:57.680
way too much practice.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.160
I love you, mom.

19:03.360 --> 19:04.240
I do love my mom.

19:06.000 --> 19:06.800
I love this mom.

19:07.760 --> 19:08.880
You guys are standing there.

19:08.880 --> 19:14.880
Keith Vigna is shoving bloody screwdrivers into his pants pockets.

19:14.880 --> 19:22.080
Donovan is just staring in confusion and amazement and horrifying revelation that

19:22.080 --> 19:27.600
maybe you're not with the best people as Keith just puts his finger up the nose of Clark

19:27.600 --> 19:32.240
Bishop and then puts his finger up the nose of John Lee Pettymore.

19:32.800 --> 19:33.600
And then...

19:33.600 --> 19:36.000
Joe, is this the first time Clark's done cooking?

19:36.000 --> 19:36.960
Uh, yeah.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.280
Unless I did it for some reason earlier in the podcast.

19:39.280 --> 19:39.760
Definitely.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.880
You definitely did not.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.160
Yeah, definitely.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.280
Before he starts chanting.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.080
What's that like for...

19:44.800 --> 19:46.480
So you got to one sanity, right?

19:46.480 --> 19:47.040
Zero.

19:47.040 --> 19:47.760
Zero.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.280
So Clark's just gone.

19:49.280 --> 19:49.920
Yeah.

19:49.920 --> 19:50.240
Okay.

19:52.320 --> 19:52.800
That's sad.

19:53.840 --> 19:56.240
Clark still doesn't know what it's like to do cooking.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.000
The vessel formerly known as Clark.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.440
Towel alico.

20:03.440 --> 20:04.720
Towel alico.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.160
Towel alico.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.360
Towel alico.

20:07.360 --> 20:10.800
I guess we got to shoot them to be consistent.

20:18.720 --> 20:24.480
The lights in glass hall all go out at the exact same time and you are left with just

20:24.480 --> 20:26.400
the red emergency lights.

20:27.120 --> 20:27.600
Do the thing.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.880
The red emergency lights.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.040
The lighting, the hallway that you're in and the lab...

20:35.040 --> 20:36.080
You guys know what happened.

20:36.960 --> 20:37.920
Who told you about this?

20:37.920 --> 20:40.960
I made the room red because Thomas reminded me.

20:41.920 --> 20:42.880
Red room.

20:42.880 --> 20:43.440
Red room.

20:44.480 --> 20:48.720
And you guys see you're standing in front of this lab that is completely just like a

20:48.720 --> 20:55.200
wall of glass, like looking into this laboratory and you hear the doors that you just came

20:55.200 --> 21:01.120
in the entrance to glass hall bust open and you hear a bunch of chatter from up there.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.080
Go, go, go.

21:05.040 --> 21:11.040
And you hear a voice of an older woman say, oh my God, I just got to get you as many

21:11.040 --> 21:12.800
presents as I possibly can get.

21:15.760 --> 21:16.320
Go, go.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.040
We got another.

21:17.040 --> 21:17.680
Clear, clear.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.520
And we are in combat round.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.960
Clark Bishop, you're up first.

21:24.960 --> 21:25.680
You're chanting.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.120
What do you do while you're chanting?

21:27.120 --> 21:31.120
I think we ended with my hand out asking if I could help carry the screwdrivers.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.120
If he was handing me one, I'm taking it.

21:33.120 --> 21:36.480
Otherwise I'm reaching down to the body that had those screwdrivers hanging out of it and

21:36.480 --> 21:36.960
grabbing one.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.240
Yeah, I'm offering him one.

21:38.240 --> 21:39.600
Then I'll grab it out of his hand.

21:39.600 --> 21:40.720
John Lee Pettymore, you're up.

21:40.720 --> 21:40.960
Okay.

21:40.960 --> 21:47.200
So John Lee Pettymore, he's walking towards Clark, but you can tell that he thinks he's

21:47.200 --> 21:48.560
floating, if that makes any sense.

21:48.560 --> 21:49.920
He's making these little tippy taps.

21:49.920 --> 21:59.200
And he's just going to try to like grab Clark and move him into the lab and like hide with

21:59.200 --> 21:59.360
him.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.720
Chris angel style.

22:00.720 --> 22:05.360
Yeah, but our arms, like he's T posing, but doing little T tippy taps as he has his arms

22:05.360 --> 22:06.320
like stretched out.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.680
Clark, my child come, we must get you to safety.

22:09.680 --> 22:10.560
Keith Vigna.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.160
Do I see people coming down the stairs?

22:12.160 --> 22:17.280
When you look back up the stairs, you see the small ugly child that you saw before clean.

22:17.280 --> 22:19.840
He's wearing a backpack and cleaning the baseboards.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.880
Ferocity with ferocity.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.960
That's a word I made up last time.

22:24.960 --> 22:36.480
It means, uh, with the, uh, the very intensely and good and, and, and he's like eating that.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.400
Now I don't remember this.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.080
I don't remember that word.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.160
You might not have been conscious.

22:42.160 --> 22:42.400
Yeah.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.200
I don't remember it either.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.080
So I might not have been.

22:44.080 --> 22:44.880
Yeah, that makes sense.

22:44.880 --> 22:45.120
Okay.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.520
Um, why is there a kid at college?

22:47.520 --> 22:49.840
I hear the yelling and stuff.

22:49.840 --> 22:55.840
If I only just see that kid and nobody else, I'm going to keep getting screwdrivers, just

22:55.840 --> 22:58.000
stuff in my pockets and Donovan Westhaven.

22:58.000 --> 22:58.800
What are you doing?

22:58.800 --> 23:02.480
Is there a, is there a combat move called panic while not moving?

23:05.440 --> 23:06.080
Can I roll?

23:06.800 --> 23:10.880
And Leon Simpson just keeps dancing and grinding, just moving and grooving.

23:10.880 --> 23:16.160
Hey, Hey, you gotta get down to the flow and he's just grinding up on it.

23:16.160 --> 23:23.680
And then you guys hear from upstairs, you hear, you hear a clink, clink, clink, and

23:23.680 --> 23:29.520
looking up the stairs, you see a small canister and gas starts emitting out of it.

23:29.520 --> 23:33.040
And it's right next to this kid cleaning the baseboards with that.

23:33.040 --> 23:36.960
It's Clark Bishop's turn and you are being moved into the lab currently.

23:36.960 --> 23:37.600
What are you doing?

23:37.600 --> 23:38.800
John's just pushing you.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.640
You guys can simultaneously here.

23:40.640 --> 23:45.120
If you're just pushing me, I'm not going with the push and I'm going to the opposite

23:45.120 --> 23:50.480
wall from the glass walls to the cinder block wall and trying to rub the screwdrivers

23:50.480 --> 23:52.960
head really hard to kind of sharpen the tip of it.

23:52.960 --> 23:53.360
Okay.

23:53.360 --> 23:56.240
So if you want him to not do that, we're going to roll a strength.

23:56.240 --> 23:58.240
No, I, I, I abandoned.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.880
I like throw my hands up cause I'm not getting anywhere with him.

24:01.440 --> 24:06.080
And I pick up a pile of screwdrivers from the floor and I wave them.

24:06.080 --> 24:09.280
Look, look, look, look, shiny, shiny screwdrivers.

24:09.280 --> 24:12.480
And I throw them like in front of the door for the lab.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.240
Make it rain, brother.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.280
Hell yeah.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.000
Make it rain.

24:16.000 --> 24:16.720
I like that.

24:16.720 --> 24:17.920
Those were the best ones.

24:17.920 --> 24:18.960
Those were the best ones.

24:18.960 --> 24:19.840
They're all good.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.520
They all worth the same amount.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.360
There was a, there was one that was worth more.

24:24.320 --> 24:25.520
Not what I'm seeing.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.120
It said, it said on there.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.880
Very good screwdriver.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.160
Better than the rest.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.840
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

24:31.840 --> 24:32.800
But, uh, fuck.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.280
Why are you rubbing that up against the wall?

24:35.840 --> 24:37.840
Double elical, double elical.

24:37.840 --> 24:40.960
Uh, I see that has the, the canister has started emitting.

24:40.960 --> 24:41.760
It's on the stairs.

24:41.760 --> 24:42.000
Yeah.

24:42.000 --> 24:42.880
And it's going off.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.480
Smoke hasn't made it down here yet though.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.080
Is the lab open?

24:46.080 --> 24:48.960
The door is closed, but it is just a push.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.240
It's not like a lock.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.680
I see the gas coming out.

24:51.680 --> 24:59.200
I take a one last, like handful of screwdrivers, shoving my pockets and I head towards the door,

24:59.200 --> 25:01.040
try to open it up and go in that room.

25:01.040 --> 25:01.360
Okay.

25:01.360 --> 25:01.840
Sounds good.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.360
You'll be in there at the start of next round.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.200
Donovan West Haven.

25:05.200 --> 25:10.080
I am going to follow Keith and just cause like, I'm like, it's better than staying right here.

25:10.080 --> 25:10.800
Absolutely.

25:10.800 --> 25:17.440
And Leon Simpson is going to continue just moving, grinding, bumping, bopping, duping,

25:17.440 --> 25:18.800
dipin' and dopin'.

25:18.800 --> 25:24.880
And at that moment you see legs, just legs, and then torsos.

25:26.240 --> 25:34.240
A squad of four men dressed in black tactical gear with flashlights at the tips of their

25:34.240 --> 25:35.600
submachine guns.

25:35.600 --> 25:42.080
And they each have a canister in their hands and you hear, oh, we got a bunch down here.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.360
We got a bunch down here.

25:43.360 --> 25:44.880
Get go, get go, get go.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.600
Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting, ting.

25:47.600 --> 25:51.760
And four canisters roll right next to you guys in the hallway outside the lab.

25:51.760 --> 25:51.920
And...

25:56.320 --> 25:59.280
Joe, if you could hit that vape real hard and just blow it around here and get some

25:59.280 --> 26:02.560
smoke in the room, really make it, really make it real for us.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.600
Fatter, fatter.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.720
Oh, we need those clouds.

26:04.720 --> 26:05.520
Get that rip.

26:05.520 --> 26:06.800
Oh shit.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.000
That was actually really fat.

26:10.720 --> 26:16.080
It's like I'm looking into the sky on a beautiful summer's day.

26:20.480 --> 26:23.040
Thomas, what if you got popcorn lung just from that one hit?

26:24.160 --> 26:25.280
I'd haunt you all.

26:27.280 --> 26:30.000
We'd all talk like every time you were haunting us, we'd be like...

26:32.240 --> 26:33.760
No, that's what I would do.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.120
Every night while you tried to sleep.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.080
Just behind your head.

26:38.080 --> 26:44.320
Clark Bishop, it is the top of the third round and you have a sharp screwdriver in your hand.

26:44.320 --> 26:44.820
What do you do?

26:45.680 --> 26:49.200
He kind of looks around and gives a smile to everyone around

26:50.000 --> 26:55.200
and jams the pick into his eye and up through the top of his head.

26:56.160 --> 27:03.760
Clark's chanting ceases as he shoves this sharpened screwdriver into the white of his eye

27:04.400 --> 27:08.320
and blood begins dripping down his face.

27:08.960 --> 27:14.960
But with one last staccato motion, he shoves the handle of the screwdriver

27:14.960 --> 27:23.360
flush with his eye socket and a stream of warm dark red blood sprays into the air as

27:23.360 --> 27:33.600
each of his limbs go limp and the body of Clark Bishop crumbles into a pile on the floor.

27:35.920 --> 27:36.640
So it's my turn.

27:43.840 --> 27:44.960
It is your turn?

27:44.960 --> 27:46.960
I'd like to load our autosave.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.720
Wait, could I have done that, Zach?

27:52.720 --> 27:54.480
We turned autosave off and we...

27:54.480 --> 27:56.480
Oh, come on, we're on survival mode?

27:57.200 --> 27:58.560
Are we going for achievements?

27:58.560 --> 28:03.680
I think we were fighting the fishmen the last time we actually saved.

28:03.680 --> 28:04.960
Well, listeners.

28:08.880 --> 28:14.240
You all walk into a dank, dark room the size of a football field and you see

28:15.280 --> 28:16.320
catwalks going...

28:16.320 --> 28:18.000
No, I quit the podcast.

28:18.320 --> 28:18.820
Yeah.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.520
Joe, Clark is dead.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.240
Long live Clark.

28:26.240 --> 28:27.040
Long live Clark.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.080
Get the fuck out of the room.

28:30.080 --> 28:30.960
Good luck, fellas.

28:31.520 --> 28:33.120
Your hair looks pretty crazy right now.

28:34.000 --> 28:34.560
Wait, wait, wait.

28:34.560 --> 28:36.880
Can Joe just lay down on the ground right now?

28:38.400 --> 28:39.840
Make gurgling sounds.

28:39.840 --> 28:40.720
Joe, be a dead...

28:40.720 --> 28:41.840
Oh, roleplay a dead guy.

28:42.560 --> 28:43.440
Can we eat your foot?

28:48.080 --> 28:48.560
I'm at it.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.760
John Lee Pettymore, it's your turn.

29:05.760 --> 29:10.320
You just saw Clark Bishop stab himself in the eye with a screwdriver and fall limply

29:10.320 --> 29:11.280
dead to the ground.

29:11.280 --> 29:15.920
Yeah, and you see that affect real John just very briefly.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.960
Like a flash in his eyes before he...

29:18.960 --> 29:21.920
Well, that's real handy because I'm going to have you all roll sanity for me.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.560
Oh, I passed 16 on a 19.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.760
Oh my God.

29:29.760 --> 29:33.440
The only reason I passed or the only reason I rolled is because it's my friend.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.240
If it was anybody else, I'd be like, I don't give a fuck.

29:39.840 --> 29:41.120
I got a 99.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.480
Oh, God fuck.

29:44.480 --> 29:48.720
Which is the crittest of fails, except for 100.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.680
Except for 100.

29:50.320 --> 29:54.000
Hey, Thomas, you're going to lose four sanity.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.680
Well, that's all I got.

29:55.680 --> 29:58.080
Yeah, no more sanity for John Lee Pettymore.

29:58.960 --> 30:02.640
Okay, I need Donovan to roll a d4 for me.

30:03.840 --> 30:04.480
Oh, there it is.

30:06.720 --> 30:07.120
One.

30:07.120 --> 30:07.620
Nice.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.560
So as you lose one sanity, you're still going to be able to keep your wits about you for

30:12.560 --> 30:15.520
the time being as fucked up as that seems.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.280
Not too rattled on.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.280
You don't really know this guy that well.

30:19.280 --> 30:22.800
With that, though, I'm going to have Luke and Justin leave the room.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.400
You guys could just stay here.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.160
He's not like a cop or anything.

30:31.600 --> 30:32.640
Can you stop me, sir?

30:32.640 --> 30:33.680
What are you going to do about it?

30:33.680 --> 30:34.480
Don't leave.

30:34.480 --> 30:46.320
Wait, you listen to cops.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.760
As soon as they come back in the room, you're going to start chanting.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.280
Can you teach me how to chant again?

30:55.280 --> 30:56.880
A towel.

30:56.880 --> 30:57.840
Towel.

30:57.840 --> 30:58.800
Alakol.

30:58.800 --> 30:59.520
Alakol.

30:59.520 --> 31:00.720
Towel alakol.

31:00.720 --> 31:00.960
Yes.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.000
Towel alakol.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.920
And I need you to roll a d4 for me.

31:04.960 --> 31:05.440
Three.

31:05.440 --> 31:12.800
You are going to start working on finding a way to kill yourself over the next three

31:12.800 --> 31:13.440
rounds.

31:13.440 --> 31:15.120
I mean, I think I just have a gun, right?

31:15.120 --> 31:15.680
Yep.

31:15.680 --> 31:19.200
And on the fourth round, you have to go through with it.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.800
Can I go through with it before that?

31:20.800 --> 31:21.440
You cannot.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.320
Oh, okay.

31:22.320 --> 31:26.320
I have to give them a chance to realize what's going on like we didn't with Joe?

31:26.320 --> 31:27.600
That is correct.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.100
Okay.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.360
I'll get the other boys back in here.

31:34.480 --> 31:47.280
Okay.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.080
John Lee Pennymore walks straight back to the corner.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.840
He's still doing the tippy tap thing.

31:51.840 --> 31:57.200
Like he thinks he's floating with his face to the corner of the back wall of the slab

31:57.200 --> 31:58.320
and his arms outstretched.

31:58.320 --> 31:59.040
He starts saying.

31:59.680 --> 32:00.960
Towel alakol.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.160
Towel alakol.

32:02.160 --> 32:03.440
Towel alakol.

32:03.440 --> 32:04.240
Towel alakol.

32:04.240 --> 32:09.200
And you guys notice as you, as you get into this lab, you're just paying so much attention

32:09.200 --> 32:15.200
to John as he walks away from you and starts chanting this that you barely notice the woman

32:15.200 --> 32:20.960
and the lab coat or the man and the lab coat sitting at a desk faced away from you.

32:20.960 --> 32:22.000
Are there two people?

32:22.000 --> 32:26.160
Two people, one man, one woman, both wearing lab coats and the woman looks at you and it's

32:26.160 --> 32:27.600
like, oh my goodness.

32:27.600 --> 32:32.880
Oh, oh, thank God someone came except for he's doing the, he's doing the chanting and

32:32.880 --> 32:33.760
he is he.

32:33.840 --> 32:39.120
She looks at Keith Vigna and Donovan Westhaven and it's like, do you know how to fix him?

32:39.120 --> 32:44.320
I like briefly look at her and then I look down, I get down on my knees and I start pulling

32:44.320 --> 32:49.760
all of the stuff out of my pockets and I start counting it with a huge smile on my face.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.720
Donovan, what are you doing?

32:50.720 --> 32:54.160
I don't understand the, to the, the woman who's talking, what about the man?

32:54.160 --> 32:55.840
Is he also looking at us or?

32:55.840 --> 33:00.080
No, he's faced away from you and he's bent over a desk, kind of like slumped over.

33:01.040 --> 33:06.560
Okay, well, I'll acknowledge the person who's acknowledged me as is Donovan's way.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.080
I don't, I don't understand what's happening.

33:08.080 --> 33:12.960
These, these people, they've all started going crazy and I don't know what's happening.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.720
Everyone all over the campus is going crazy.

33:14.720 --> 33:18.160
And they've all been committing suicide after they started going crazy.

33:19.280 --> 33:20.960
I'm trying to count here.

33:23.120 --> 33:24.720
Why is he counting screwdrivers?

33:24.720 --> 33:25.600
I don't, I don't know.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.600
He just started doing this minutes ago.

33:27.680 --> 33:31.840
And then you guys look out and through the glass, you see into the hallway

33:31.840 --> 33:36.720
filled with smoke and bathed in red emergency bulbs.

33:36.720 --> 33:43.600
Through the gas, you see the beams from four flashlights attached to the barrels of this

33:43.600 --> 33:45.680
four man squad's rifles.

33:45.680 --> 33:53.040
The hazy gleam illuminates the screwdriver filled old woman and the body of Clark Bishop

33:53.040 --> 34:00.640
before all four rifles are pointed at Leon Simpson, who has ceased to dance.

34:00.640 --> 34:15.280
And you hear and then, and then he falls over without doing anything.

34:16.240 --> 34:17.680
He's just standing there chanting.

34:18.240 --> 34:20.800
And then he falls over clear.

34:20.800 --> 34:21.840
We got more in the lab.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.000
On the right.

34:25.120 --> 34:27.680
It is John Lee Pettymore's turn.

34:27.680 --> 34:32.320
John turns around from the wall and looks at the door and draws his gun.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.160
And that's his turn.

34:34.160 --> 34:34.800
Keith Vigna.

34:34.800 --> 34:38.720
As I'm counting, I like look over my shoulder through the glass.

34:38.720 --> 34:40.800
I see Leon fall down.

34:40.800 --> 34:41.760
What else do I see?

34:41.760 --> 34:48.080
These guys, they move in and they're all wearing this like full tactical gear from

34:48.080 --> 34:55.760
combat boots all the way up to a gas mask, big goggles on the gas masks and helmets on top.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.000
Just some straight Resident Evil motherfuckers.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.640
I position myself to wear my pile of goodies.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.280
Like it's me, my pile of goodies.

35:05.280 --> 35:10.800
And then I have clear sight of the door looking at them, but also just continue counting.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.000
What's your name, sir?

35:12.000 --> 35:12.480
Donovan.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.440
Donovan Westhaven.

35:13.440 --> 35:14.160
I go here.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.720
Are you the only one about them who's got the wits?

35:16.720 --> 35:17.600
I think so.

35:17.600 --> 35:21.600
I don't know why, but I haven't been infected with whatever's happening.

35:21.600 --> 35:22.320
I'm Barbara.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.120
This is Phillip.

35:23.120 --> 35:29.360
And she points at the man who slumped over behind her and she's like, we are also fine.

35:29.360 --> 35:32.240
Everyone's going crazy around us and we're just fine.

35:32.240 --> 35:35.680
That's a relief that there's, it's not just me that's safe.

35:35.680 --> 35:36.640
Yes, absolutely.

35:36.640 --> 35:39.520
But I mean, you've seen it all from the beginning, ain't you?

35:39.520 --> 35:40.240
I guess I have.

35:40.240 --> 35:45.040
I just, I thought there was some like weird campus prank or something in the beginning.

35:45.040 --> 35:46.400
And now it's freaky.

35:46.400 --> 35:51.200
It's it's I don't, I don't, he doesn't know how to find the words to describe the terrors

35:51.200 --> 35:52.560
that he is experiencing.

35:52.560 --> 35:54.800
When he's, he's like stammering and finishes.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.320
I look over my shoulder at him.

35:56.320 --> 36:00.320
I'm like, I think they sent the tweets and then I continue doing what I'm doing.

36:00.320 --> 36:00.960
Oh yes.

36:00.960 --> 36:02.880
Yes, I did send those tweets.

36:02.880 --> 36:05.520
Yes, me and me and Phillip both sent those tweets.

36:05.520 --> 36:08.640
And Phillip, tell them, tell them what you told me earlier.

36:10.160 --> 36:10.960
Dead silence.

36:10.960 --> 36:15.840
And then she's like, Phillip, you have such a wit about you.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.120
Fuck.

36:17.120 --> 36:21.200
Like, he's so like, he's like, Oh God, I'm literally the only sane person right now.

36:21.200 --> 36:21.840
I look over at her.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.760
I'm like, did you guys leave this outside?

36:24.880 --> 36:26.400
Did you leave all this outside?

36:26.400 --> 36:29.280
Oh, and I, I wave, I wave one around.

36:29.280 --> 36:33.120
Barbara looks back up to Donovan and she's like, why is he doing that?

36:33.120 --> 36:33.760
I don't know.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.560
I mean, I guess there's no reason for any of this anymore.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.400
I suppose it's just more for me then.

36:39.360 --> 36:40.080
Oh, crazy.

36:41.040 --> 36:44.080
I think, I think we need, is John still chanting?

36:48.720 --> 36:52.160
I think we need to, can we, can you help me restrain him?

36:52.160 --> 36:52.480
Yes.

36:52.480 --> 36:53.440
Yes, of course.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.840
I'm like walking towards, do I even know John's name?

36:56.720 --> 36:58.560
Oh God, sir.

36:58.560 --> 37:00.080
I just know Clark and Leon.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.120
Yeah, probably not.

37:01.120 --> 37:06.000
So I'll let you guys roll a, uh, if, if John, uh, doesn't want to be.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.320
John will contest it, whatever you do.

37:08.320 --> 37:12.000
Okay, so you'll get a strength check and I'll give you, because there are two of us doing

37:12.000 --> 37:16.640
it, even though we're probably not as strong as John Lee Pettymore is, I'll give you a

37:16.640 --> 37:19.600
70 strength with two people working together.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.440
So it's a blackjack rules.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.160
So you want to roll as high as possible without going over.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.040
Price is right rules.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.000
John's got a 50.

37:26.000 --> 37:26.800
What did I say?

37:26.800 --> 37:27.760
Blackjack.

37:27.760 --> 37:28.320
Oh yeah.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.120
Price is right.

37:29.120 --> 37:29.920
Makes way more sense.

37:29.920 --> 37:32.240
Well, you always want to hit that big roll in blackjack.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.000
Okay, come on.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.760
Spay and neuter those pets, Justin.

37:41.040 --> 37:41.540
Fuck.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.040
I fucked up too.

37:43.040 --> 37:44.160
So I got a 14.

37:44.160 --> 37:45.280
I got a five.

37:45.280 --> 37:45.780
Yeah.

37:48.240 --> 37:48.740
Yes.

37:49.520 --> 37:49.760
Okay.

37:49.760 --> 37:53.920
So as Barbara and Donovan come toward John Lee Pettymore, what does John Lee Pettymore

37:53.920 --> 37:54.320
do?

37:54.320 --> 37:57.680
Oh, he just like, he very smoothly just like wiles away.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.880
He just kind of like waves his arms and he's gone.

38:00.880 --> 38:01.760
He's so slippery.

38:02.560 --> 38:09.120
And it's John Lee Pettymore's turn as these four men point their flashlights into the

38:09.120 --> 38:13.440
lab through the glass door and are clearly preparing an entrance.

38:13.440 --> 38:21.840
John Lee Pettymore points his service revolver at his chin and he says, God is dead.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.840
God remains dead and we have killed him.

38:27.280 --> 38:28.720
And it's Keith Vigna's turn.

38:28.720 --> 38:32.240
I look over my shoulder and I see them getting ready to come in.

38:32.240 --> 38:37.520
I grab an arm full of what I've been counting, trying to get as much as I can.

38:37.520 --> 38:44.080
And I run behind the desk, drop it on the ground and then prepare for an assault.

38:44.640 --> 38:50.960
I'm going to take my gun out and I want to shoot John Lee Pettymore to stop him from,

38:50.960 --> 38:54.800
I'm assuming killing himself because that's all I've seen is people kill themselves.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.000
Where are you shooting him?

38:56.000 --> 38:59.440
I don't know if Donovan would know better to like, not the head.

38:59.440 --> 39:02.400
Yeah, you have a 30% on firearms we dictated.

39:02.400 --> 39:05.440
So a called shot would give you a 10% chance.

39:05.440 --> 39:07.280
So you're just going to go ahead and fire.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.960
I'm just going to shoot him and hope it like

39:08.960 --> 39:11.840
knocks him out of shooting himself and disables him.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.360
Go ahead and roll that firearms.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.480
But can I have a bonus power of love of Clark?

39:20.160 --> 39:21.920
The spirit of Clark compels you.

39:21.920 --> 39:25.440
This is for Clark, my new dad.

39:26.240 --> 39:26.800
Oh no.

39:26.800 --> 39:27.440
Yeah, I'm good.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.040
Didn't.

39:29.040 --> 39:29.680
87.

39:30.560 --> 39:31.200
He's bad.

39:31.200 --> 39:32.080
He's not good.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.320
You shoot John directly in the head.

39:35.920 --> 39:36.640
Oh God.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.760
It wasn't a crit fail.

39:37.760 --> 39:43.040
So you fire just past him and you're like, the camera zooms, like the camera is looking

39:43.040 --> 39:44.560
at your gun as it fires.

39:44.560 --> 39:47.200
And then when it zooms up to your face, you've got your eyes closed.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.440
That checks out.

39:49.440 --> 39:55.120
You see that there's this piece of machinery behind John Lee Pettymore where he's standing

39:55.920 --> 40:01.280
and Barbara looks at you and she's like, that happened to be the machinery we were going

40:01.280 --> 40:05.440
to use to try to create some sort of antivirus for whatever's happening here.

40:05.440 --> 40:05.840
Oh God.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.760
I'm so, I'm so sorry.

40:07.760 --> 40:12.720
And then she turns to Phillip and she's like, Phillip, I just don't think that we're going

40:12.720 --> 40:14.480
to be able to make it through this.

40:14.480 --> 40:20.240
And she puts her hand on Phillip's shoulder and as she does, she kind of like pushes him

40:20.240 --> 40:24.880
a little bit and the rolly chair that he's in rolls, like spins around.

40:24.880 --> 40:34.080
And you see that this man has no eyes and there's blood just running down from his eye

40:34.080 --> 40:35.120
holes.

40:35.120 --> 40:43.440
And in each one of his hands, he is holding his own eyeballs, stringy mucus hanging off

40:43.440 --> 40:47.440
the end of each one limply in both of his dead hands.

40:47.440 --> 40:48.880
So you're like Pan's Labyrinth.

40:49.600 --> 40:50.720
Yeah, exactly.

40:50.720 --> 40:52.400
But grosser somehow.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.080
Oh, much grosser.

40:54.080 --> 41:01.360
And at that moment, the door gets kicked in and you hear, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

41:01.360 --> 41:05.760
And you hear canisters hit the floor and smoke starts filling the lab.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.080
It's John Lee Pettymore's turn.

41:08.800 --> 41:16.720
With a look of just complete contentment, it's honestly unnerving.

41:17.520 --> 41:21.200
But you've never seen a being more at peace with itself.

41:22.640 --> 41:28.320
John Lee Pettymore just looks out at all of you and like smiles and then blows his brains

41:28.320 --> 41:29.520
out through the back of his head.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.520
I need you both to roll sanity.

41:37.200 --> 41:37.700
Pass.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.160
He knows we're all ball.

41:43.440 --> 41:44.560
I fail.

41:44.560 --> 41:46.080
Roll a d4 for me, Luke.

41:46.080 --> 41:51.760
Three, which brings me down to 16.

41:51.760 --> 41:52.960
Alrighty.

41:52.960 --> 41:59.920
Thomas, go ahead and leave the room.

42:09.200 --> 42:12.960
John Lee Pettymore falls backwards and hits the ground.

42:13.760 --> 42:17.600
And a pool of blood starts forming around his head.

42:18.720 --> 42:20.000
And it's Keith Vigna's turn.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.680
Well, I hear the gunshot and I turn around to see it.

42:27.600 --> 42:28.100
Fuck.

42:29.680 --> 42:35.600
And I almost like, I feel like I'm going to throw up, but I keep it down and I look down

42:35.600 --> 42:36.640
at what's in front of me.

42:37.520 --> 42:40.640
This is all going to his funeral, if I can keep it.

42:40.640 --> 42:41.680
And then I look at the door.

42:41.680 --> 42:44.480
The smoke is currently coming out of the canisters on the ground in front of you.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.640
The next thing I want to do is when they enter the room.

42:46.640 --> 42:47.680
Okay, Donovan.

42:47.680 --> 42:53.280
Donovan would instinctively like go into like, I'm being arrested mode because he's like,

42:53.280 --> 42:54.560
I don't know what the fuck is happening.

42:54.560 --> 43:00.960
And everyone he's been following has gone crazy and is either killed themselves or is

43:00.960 --> 43:03.520
counting screwdrivers on the floor.

43:03.520 --> 43:06.560
He just like gets on his knees and like submits.

43:06.560 --> 43:09.760
Like does the hands behind the head, just gets on the knees.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.080
Help, I don't know what's happening.

43:12.080 --> 43:12.400
Help.

43:12.400 --> 43:17.920
I hear him say that and I look over to him like, you got to help me protect this stash.

43:17.920 --> 43:19.040
Get up and fight.

43:19.920 --> 43:20.480
I do not.

43:21.760 --> 43:27.840
I feel betrayed and then I am preparing, but I wait for the entrance of.

43:27.840 --> 43:32.800
Yeah, if you're, if you're like holding your turn until something happens, these guys bust

43:32.800 --> 43:35.600
into the room all four of them at the same time.

43:35.600 --> 43:38.160
From that preparing, like an aim kind of thing.

43:38.160 --> 43:38.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:38.640 --> 43:39.360
So what do you do?

43:39.360 --> 43:42.720
I pick up the objects in front of me, a handful.

43:43.520 --> 43:46.160
I like focus in on them.

43:46.160 --> 43:52.160
My mind is going a thousand miles an hour from that bump of pure coke.

43:52.160 --> 43:53.280
Glass family cocaine.

43:53.280 --> 43:54.240
Glass family coke.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.800
Focus in on the four guys.

43:56.800 --> 44:03.520
And what Donovan would see is I take a screwdriver in my hand, holding it like a piece of money

44:03.520 --> 44:09.680
paper and I like snap it, flick it like I'm throwing a card.

44:09.680 --> 44:10.240
Right.

44:10.240 --> 44:15.920
And I'm aiming right at the neck between the helmet and the body armor.

44:15.920 --> 44:16.480
Sure.

44:16.480 --> 44:19.360
And that one exposed piece of skin.

44:19.360 --> 44:19.920
Yep.

44:19.920 --> 44:20.240
And I.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.240
Try to throw a bunch of screwdrivers.

44:24.240 --> 44:31.760
Well, I am flicking in my mind, paper money at them, trying to like get it into them.

44:31.760 --> 44:35.280
But in reality, I'm throwing screwdrivers into their necks.

44:35.280 --> 44:35.600
Okay.

44:35.600 --> 44:43.680
So you're going to roll athletics and I will give you a plus 40, 20 for being prepared

44:43.680 --> 44:49.280
and 20 for being gacked out and just fully believing that this is possible.

44:49.280 --> 44:51.680
And then negative 20 for it being a called shot.

44:51.680 --> 44:53.200
So it's a plus 20 overall.

44:55.200 --> 44:56.080
And not one.

44:56.080 --> 44:56.960
No, you fucking didn't.

44:56.960 --> 44:58.080
I fucking swear to you.

44:58.720 --> 44:59.040
Seven.

44:59.600 --> 45:01.600
It's a seven.

45:02.320 --> 45:03.360
Holy shit.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.320
God damn it.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.880
I thought it was, but I mean, that's still pretty good.

45:06.880 --> 45:07.120
Yeah.

45:07.120 --> 45:08.240
It's still a pass.

45:08.240 --> 45:10.240
So I thought for sure it was a one.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.920
I was stoked as fuck, but nope.

45:11.920 --> 45:12.320
Seven.

45:12.320 --> 45:17.200
With that, I'm going to have both of you roll a constitution check.

45:17.200 --> 45:21.520
You will be at a negative 20 for being yocked out of one mind.

45:21.520 --> 45:23.280
23 on what would be a 50.

45:24.240 --> 45:25.360
Pass 38.

45:25.360 --> 45:25.760
Yes.

45:26.720 --> 45:27.040
Okay.

45:27.280 --> 45:33.360
So three screwdrivers hit the guy who's leading the team.

45:33.360 --> 45:34.560
Two of them just hit him.

45:34.560 --> 45:36.720
Like one hits him in the gas mask.

45:36.720 --> 45:38.880
One hits him in the chest and they just bounce off.

45:38.880 --> 45:44.640
But one of them slides through and hits him directly in the neck, right in between the

45:44.640 --> 45:46.800
gas mask and his body armor.

45:46.800 --> 45:52.480
And he falls to the ground and the other three are like, Oh shit, he's got screwdrivers.

45:52.480 --> 45:54.320
He's got screwdrivers.

45:54.880 --> 45:57.760
And they fire.

45:57.760 --> 46:00.000
When I hear he's got screwdrivers, I laugh.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.240
I'm like, that's what you call it.

46:02.240 --> 46:03.520
I got screwdrivers.

46:05.120 --> 46:07.200
Also, I am hiding behind this desk.

46:08.080 --> 46:09.200
So I'm covered.

46:09.200 --> 46:13.600
In order to use cover, you would have had to say, yeah, beforehand.

46:13.600 --> 46:16.160
And then you would have taken another negative on that role.

46:16.160 --> 46:20.480
So I think the only part exposed is your head.

46:20.480 --> 46:23.520
My, my, my most vulnerable part of my body.

46:23.520 --> 46:24.020
Yeah.

46:24.320 --> 46:24.820
Okay.

46:26.400 --> 46:33.920
All three of them passed their firearms checks and they are, they're lining you up.

46:33.920 --> 46:37.840
Keith is going to take 22 points of damage.

46:39.360 --> 46:40.640
I'm still alive, baby.

46:41.200 --> 46:42.320
How much HP did you have?

46:42.320 --> 46:42.960
25.

46:42.960 --> 46:43.600
Holy shit.

46:43.600 --> 46:48.480
So you're down to three because you took more than half of your full health points in one

46:48.480 --> 46:48.640
hit.

46:48.640 --> 46:52.960
You have to roll a constitution check in order to not take like major damage.

46:52.960 --> 46:54.160
46 on a 70.

46:54.160 --> 46:54.640
All right.

46:54.640 --> 46:59.760
So not only are you still conscious, but you're not going to take like a lifelong ill effect

46:59.760 --> 47:01.280
to those bullets.

47:01.280 --> 47:03.840
I don't know how life, how long life is.

47:04.480 --> 47:06.560
You're like bleeding out on the ground.

47:06.560 --> 47:10.640
You're like laying down, but you're still conscious and you can still act.

47:10.640 --> 47:17.520
Barbara immediately is just like hugging on to Philip, the man who is like bent over and

47:17.520 --> 47:18.960
he's like slumping out of the chair.

47:18.960 --> 47:24.800
And as she's trying to like cover him with her body, they both kind of fall out of the

47:24.800 --> 47:26.080
chair together.

47:26.080 --> 47:31.760
You see them both hit the ground and looking over, Barbara's eyes are wide open, but she

47:31.760 --> 47:33.040
is unconscious.

47:33.840 --> 47:35.840
Keith, it's your turn again.

47:35.840 --> 47:37.360
I'm laying on the ground.

47:37.360 --> 47:45.920
I put my finger into a bullet hole, pull my finger trigger, and I mainline some fucking

47:45.920 --> 47:47.360
coke right into my bloodstream.

47:49.280 --> 47:49.680
All right.

47:49.680 --> 47:55.680
Lose 10 more luck and I'll let you just hop to and do whatever you want on your next turn.

47:55.680 --> 47:58.240
Also, as Donovan is acting, you hear me go.

48:03.760 --> 48:05.280
Did you see that?

48:07.120 --> 48:09.440
Donovan is like, just like, what the fuck is that?

48:09.440 --> 48:11.360
Like he's like still just on his knees.

48:11.360 --> 48:11.520
Yeah.

48:11.520 --> 48:14.240
I'm just like, I'm like, I'm, I'm not one of them.

48:14.240 --> 48:17.280
Like I'm trying to like communicate with the people over.

48:17.280 --> 48:20.080
Is it, are the gunshots happening as I'm talking or is it already?

48:20.080 --> 48:21.680
The gunshots were already happening.

48:21.680 --> 48:26.080
And then one of them, as you're like clearly giving up the gun, one of them runs up to

48:26.080 --> 48:32.560
you holding like an oxygen mask kind of thing and is going to try to put it on your face.

48:32.560 --> 48:33.600
Are you going to let him?

48:33.600 --> 48:34.320
I let him.

48:34.320 --> 48:34.640
Okay.

48:34.640 --> 48:40.240
So as he puts it on your face, your eyes roll into the back of your head and you fall on

48:40.240 --> 48:42.480
your back right to sleep.

48:42.480 --> 48:42.640
Oh,

48:42.880 --> 48:43.520
pleasant.

48:43.520 --> 48:44.960
I need you to leave the room, Justin.

48:44.960 --> 48:45.520
No, I'm good.

48:45.520 --> 48:45.840
Okay.

48:45.840 --> 48:46.560
Sounds good.

48:46.560 --> 48:47.440
I'm not a cop.

49:05.440 --> 49:09.840
Keith, another one runs up to you and is going to do the same thing, has a gas mask and yells

49:10.720 --> 49:13.280
out to the others, like this one's a fighter.

49:13.280 --> 49:13.920
Oh shit.

49:13.920 --> 49:17.440
There's something, this one's really, what in the, and they're going to try to put this

49:17.440 --> 49:19.200
gas mask over on top of your face.

49:19.200 --> 49:24.160
This guy is looking me in the eyes and he sees my pupils are dilated.

49:24.160 --> 49:30.560
Like I have no iris and they're dilated so much that I have very little white in my eyes.

49:30.560 --> 49:32.560
I see him coming up doing this.

49:32.560 --> 49:35.680
I take a screwdriver and shove it through his neck.

49:35.680 --> 49:36.960
Opposed melee combat.

49:36.960 --> 49:38.160
I do want to set this up.

49:38.160 --> 49:46.640
I do that with my left hand as I have my hand on my gun in case I do pass this role, preparing

49:46.640 --> 49:47.440
for my next.

49:48.240 --> 49:48.640
Okay.

49:48.640 --> 49:49.360
Sounds good.

49:49.360 --> 49:50.320
So what am I rolling?

49:50.320 --> 49:51.840
Opposed melee combat.

49:55.760 --> 49:57.760
That's a 42 on a 50.

49:59.040 --> 50:00.480
I rolled a 16.

50:00.480 --> 50:01.760
Oh, okay.

50:01.760 --> 50:06.800
So you shove this screwdriver up into the exact same spot that you hit the other guy.

50:06.800 --> 50:07.760
Carotid artery.

50:08.320 --> 50:14.160
Oh, and blood just splatters straight down all over your blood riddled body already.

50:14.160 --> 50:16.160
I look like Nick cage and Mandy.

50:17.360 --> 50:20.400
And this guy just like falls over to the side.

50:20.400 --> 50:25.200
And I take, I take the screwdriver out because that's a fucking hundred dollar bill.

50:25.200 --> 50:30.720
I shove it into my pocket and then I aim my gun at the next guy.

50:31.440 --> 50:34.560
So there's one who's putting the gas mask on Donovan.

50:34.560 --> 50:36.720
One who is coming around the other side of the room.

50:37.200 --> 50:39.200
Not the gas mask on Donovan's guy.

50:39.200 --> 50:39.600
Okay.

50:39.600 --> 50:40.160
Sounds good.

50:40.160 --> 50:41.840
So it is their turn.

50:41.840 --> 50:50.480
And as they turn the corner rifle aimed at you, they see the second victim of your screwdrivers

50:50.480 --> 50:52.080
and immediately fire.

50:54.400 --> 51:01.600
Rolled a 17 and is going to get you for six damage.

51:02.160 --> 51:02.960
That kills me.

51:07.280 --> 51:14.800
As Keith Vigna is staring down the barrel of this guy in full tactical gear coming towards

51:14.800 --> 51:18.640
him, you know, he's a trained shooter.

51:19.280 --> 51:21.200
He's got his gun right at you.

51:21.200 --> 51:25.600
You've taken out two of them, but you couldn't handle all four of them by yourself.

51:25.600 --> 51:28.080
What is the last thought going through your head?

51:28.080 --> 51:31.040
I get shot in the neck in that same spot.

51:31.040 --> 51:32.080
I killed the other two.

51:32.800 --> 51:42.160
I fall to the ground and in front of me, I see this giant pile of screwdrivers and I

51:42.160 --> 51:46.000
smile to myself and I reach out and I touch one.

51:46.960 --> 51:54.240
I hope I can take this with me.

51:54.240 --> 52:12.720
Through the haze and red emergency lights, we see the two casualties of Keith's screwdrivers,

52:13.360 --> 52:16.000
lifeless in pools of their own blood.

52:16.640 --> 52:23.200
The camera leaves the lab, passes the elderly pile of a corpse in the hallway, moves up

52:23.200 --> 52:25.280
the stairs and out of glass hall.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.720
The CSU campus is humming.

52:29.280 --> 52:31.120
Sirens are constant.

52:31.120 --> 52:39.040
Limp bodies are being transported by teams of two in full tactical gear and dragged into

52:39.040 --> 52:41.360
prison transport buses.

52:41.360 --> 52:45.600
The sky is littered with unmarked black helicopters.

52:45.600 --> 52:52.240
We see one hovering above the minion atop the bell tower, a rope ladder allowing ShamWow

52:52.240 --> 52:54.880
Chameleon to get even higher.

52:54.880 --> 53:01.760
As we leave the CSU campus, we see a confluence of black SUVs heading toward one of the taller

53:01.760 --> 53:09.760
buildings of the city skyline, a building that is being climbed by something massive

53:09.760 --> 53:11.040
and spherical.

53:11.600 --> 53:17.280
We continue past the business district and swoop down into the back of a van heading

53:17.280 --> 53:18.480
out toward the pier.

53:19.040 --> 53:27.120
The broken and upgraded and dead and metal corpses of John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna

53:27.120 --> 53:35.280
are jostling around the posterior of this van that pulls up to a grand old edifice alone

53:35.280 --> 53:41.760
on the edge of the water with a well-lit sign outside that reads, The City Asylum.

53:42.320 --> 53:49.040
Inside the front doors are two familiar guards, tall and overweight and all black with prominent

53:49.040 --> 53:50.640
facial scarring.

53:50.640 --> 53:57.040
After we move down through the floor, we are immediately looking through a long line of

53:57.040 --> 53:58.400
the bottoms of feet.

53:59.040 --> 54:04.960
Body after body has been laid out in a row covered in sheets, feet sticking out.

54:04.960 --> 54:08.480
We stop on the final four soles.

54:08.480 --> 54:10.480
Both right feet are blank.

54:10.480 --> 54:17.040
Both left feet have dead skin in the shape of the circle of knowledge, but one left foot

54:17.040 --> 54:21.920
has the name Maggie burned on top of the seven circles.

54:22.480 --> 54:28.240
Our vision moves up through the ceiling and into a small dark room.

54:28.960 --> 54:37.440
Donovan Westhaven wakes up to the sounds of beeps and bloops of a machine that you feel

54:37.440 --> 54:46.640
yourself connected to and you're laying in a hospital bed in a room that is completely

54:46.640 --> 54:51.680
dark except for the lights coming from the machine on either side of you.

54:52.720 --> 54:58.800
You see that your blood is being drawn and there is an IV in your other arm and then

54:58.800 --> 55:04.880
a screen turns on like a TV that's on one of those like roller things that they would

55:04.880 --> 55:07.040
roll in when you're in elementary school.

55:07.120 --> 55:08.480
To watch Magic School Bus on.

55:08.480 --> 55:10.560
When your teacher was hungover.

55:10.560 --> 55:12.080
Yeah, sleeping.

55:14.640 --> 55:22.800
The screen is a freeze frame of like a webcam video and it's Harriet Marks who you would

55:22.800 --> 55:25.520
recognize as a fellow student at CSU.

55:25.520 --> 55:32.400
She was a political activist pro-union and you know made herself known all over campus

55:32.400 --> 55:33.440
so you knew who she was.

55:34.000 --> 55:39.680
She also became quite something in the news when she committed suicide in her dorm room

55:40.400 --> 55:43.760
and the video starts and she is mid-chant.

55:43.760 --> 56:10.400
And then you see at the bottom of the screen the barrel of a gun comes up and she squeezes

56:10.400 --> 56:17.680
the trigger and then she with a splatter of blood behind her falls back and out of

56:17.680 --> 56:23.520
frame of the camera and you're just looking at her dorm room with a paint of blood behind

56:23.520 --> 56:27.520
her on the wall and on the ceiling and the video stops.

56:28.720 --> 56:34.560
And a man comes out of the darkness in the back corner of the room and you can see that

56:34.560 --> 56:41.120
he's lit by your machines and he's wearing a black suit with a black tie and a white

56:41.120 --> 56:41.600
shirt.

56:42.640 --> 56:46.560
I need you to tell me everything that happened.

56:51.280 --> 56:55.600
Okay.

57:04.560 --> 57:15.600
So

57:34.560 --> 57:45.600
