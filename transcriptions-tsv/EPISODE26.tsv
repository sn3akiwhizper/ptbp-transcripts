0	4560	Hello, garbage people. It's your trash truck driver, Wolf the Dog.
4560	11260	And this junkyard dog is here to dump some non-biodegradable news in your mine's landfills.
11260	16260	We are coming at you live from the most delicious trash-filled radio station,
16260	21380	Contentions' own 694.2 PTBP.
21380	28040	Remember, leave those trash cans open for your old buddy Wolf, so I can get me a late-night snack.
28040	31120	Hope y'all threw something tasty away.
31120	36240	What am I even saying? It's all tasty to me, my babies.
36240	39640	Mmmmmm.
39640	42840	We got us a new Howlin' with Wolf entry that comes from
42840	46480	at Unclear Gamer on Twitter.
46480	50000	They tweeted about the show and tagged at PretendingPod.
50000	54520	If you want to write a message for Wolf to read on air, follow the lead.

65400	68080	At Unclear Gamer writes,
68080	70600	Title, Trouble on the Force.
70600	71600	Dear Wolf,
71600	76160	After the absolute mess my other officers have made of Condention PD,
76160	80560	I have decided to leave my post here and move to the city PD.
80600	86880	A lovely woman has replaced me, and she seems blissfully unaware of the wreck she is about to walk into.
86880	93120	How can I warn her of her current predicament without shit-talking my former co-workers too much?
93120	99880	Thanks, Officer Lauren, which is poorly crossed out, followed by Disgruntled Deputy.
99880	102480	Listeners, this is some real spooky shit.
102480	105480	I've never heard of an officer in Contention named Lauren.
105480	108680	But you know, I went back and listened to some of our programming,
108680	114680	and I found a clip of myself, Wolf the Dog, talking about Officer Lauren.
114680	119280	What the extra-dimensional fuck is going on around here, y'all?
119280	124120	When it comes to advice about the Contention Police Force, I suggest a wide berth.
124120	130680	Those boys' minds and moods change about as quickly and as often as my entire reality.
130680	136480	Speaking of an unstable existence, it's time for the news.
136480	142480	The officers use the radio to put Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad,
142480	145800	relegating Agent Chad to a cat body.
145800	149960	Rosemary, one of the Glass Crime family bruisers,
149960	154840	grabbed a briefcase out of Drew's trunk she claimed has $5 million in it.
154840	162160	She was adamant about getting her hands on the gun the officers first found in the possession of Tildy B. Mitchell.
162160	166800	Doug saw the ooze inside the police station and everyone freaked out,
166800	172000	busting pipes and spraying water everywhere, effectively flooding the station.
172000	177600	Doug really lost it when he exclaimed that the water wasn't stopping the oily goop.
177600	182320	Jan Manstein, the grieving mother of Ari Manstein,
182320	186520	the Contention officer tragically killed in the fire at the city hospital,
186520	192360	came by to pick up Ari's things and asked the officers to relay the news to Ari's father Stan,
192360	196080	who has been in the city asylum for the past 20 years.
196080	200440	Wolf the dog would acquiesce to being locked up in a sanatorium,
200440	207720	as long as I can always listen to kudzu with no backbone.
216520	230720	I didn't know it could... I was hunting a female and then this buck just came out of the fucking...
230720	236560	A doe. A deer. A female deer. Ray. A drop of golden sun.
236560	239280	I hope we're not recording so there's not just an audio of me going,
239280	243600	I was hunting a female. There is now.
244600	249120	But yeah, the buck just came out of the bushes right here and knocked me on my ass.
249120	250840	I got killed by a dog today.
250840	254440	Oh yeah, he got torn apart by an Australian Shepherd.
254440	259200	Because I rode it onto this guy's farm. I was shooting birds out of the sky
259200	264000	and just accidentally wandered onto this guy's farm and he came up to me and started shooting me.
264000	268720	I thought he was a bounty hunter or something so I killed him and then all the other farmhands were witnesses
268720	272520	so I had to kill them and then the dog came and comes up.
272600	276760	So I was like, oh, okay, and I got off my horse and I didn't want to shoot the dog.
276760	280720	So yeah, it chased me and then just like ripped my throat out.
280720	283680	Holy shit. Do you find yourself dying a lot?
283680	288560	Yeah, I try not to as much as... like not as much anymore.
288560	292760	Like I've really tried... I try to be a lot more careful now and I try not to get bounties and shit.
292760	296240	I found that if I get jumped, if I get... if like there's a few random encounters
296240	298600	where like a cart will pull in front of you and then he's like, get them boys!
298600	301440	And it's like five guys come at me and almost every time I die to them.
301440	306920	Yeah, bounty hunters almost like... it seems like every time I'm fighting bounty hunters
306920	311600	I get to like the last one and I miss and he shoots me dead.
311600	315520	Oh, they finally... they released the Call of Cthulhu game.
315520	317080	Yeah, I was watching the guy stream it a little bit today.
317080	318880	Was it the one that we watched the...
318880	321000	No, it was a different one than that trailer.
321000	322200	Have you read the reviews?
322200	327560	So the first review I read basically started with, what the fuck?
329040	329880	In a bad way?
329880	333720	Yeah, apparently it's cool. Like it's a very cool game.
333720	338000	Reddit always... on the Reddit games, they always aggregate all the scores in a thread
338000	340840	and it was sixes and sevens the entire way through.
340840	346480	Yeah, so apparently the game is cool. However, it took them years to put this together.
346480	349840	Yeah, and it is eight hours of gameplay.
349840	354440	Yeah, and I think that's generous. Yeah, the thing I saw said six to seven.
354440	355480	What do you do in it?
355480	357520	Holy shit, that's dumb.
357760	361680	But, all that being said, the comments on that Reddit thread were like,
361680	364160	for what it's worth, I've played about four hours and I'm loving it.
364160	367320	Like it's apparently a lot of fun being Cthulhu-y.
367320	373240	And I love it, not being a gamer, that I can sit down with that game and play it in a day.
373240	374240	Yeah, right, sure.
374240	376080	That's actually a plus for me.
376080	379800	Call of Cthulhu is the rare bad game that's still worth playing.
381160	383440	Hell yeah, just like this campaign.
383440	384120	Hell yeah.
385120	394560	So, I wanted to talk a little bit at the top about sanity loss and rolling for sanity.
394560	400360	The example I'm going to use is, you guys saw the security footage of Dr. Marie Jacobs
400360	405480	and the body of Doug Jacobs get smashed in the ground and I asked you to roll sanity
405480	410480	and you said, but we've already seen that, why would that affect us?
411440	414160	But I was thinking about it and I was like, well maybe not,
414160	417040	like it would affect you still, but less so.
417040	419680	I like, yeah, I agree, because that's a fucked up thing to see.
419680	422280	Exactly, it's a super fucked up thing and I was thinking about it,
422280	425040	I was like, okay, so if you pass the sanity loss,
425040	429280	A, it's on security footage, you can think whatever you want to think about
429280	434000	that being tampered with or whatever, but if you lose on the sanity check,
434000	437320	A, it happened somewhere new, it happened in the police station,
437320	440200	you didn't know it could happen in the police, you just may have thought that it was...
440920	445120	Exactly, or also you realized that last time was real,
445120	450520	like you now have proof on footage of what you saw
450520	453520	and were probably trying to convince yourself it wasn't real.
453520	456600	I don't know about you guys, you guys are pretty dead set on just like...
456600	459200	I hope we see it again, I hope we see it again.
459200	461360	Yeah, so we're not going to retcon any sand loss.
461360	463360	Cool, because I ain't got much.
463360	468360	But in the future, let's try to like come up with reasons why the sand loss happened,
468400	474040	like why the fail is more interesting or different than a success on a sanity check.
474040	478680	Hey, can the next campaign be set like 20 years in the future and I'll be Rosemary's baby?
479680	483400	What about way in the future and it's Rosemary's granddaughter,
483400	487400	spitting image of my father, you know that old song?
487400	488520	Yeah, what is that song?
488520	491400	Jessica Andrews called Who I Am.
491400	493600	I think I had a crush on her, is she super pretty?
493600	494920	Uh, we're about to find out.
494920	496560	Who I Am!
497560	501560	Rock me like a hurricane!
501560	502560	Yeah!
502560	503560	Oh!
503560	508560	As you head toward the highway, you notice what Drew mentioned in his phone call.
508560	510560	A severe lack of traffic.
510560	515560	It's 9am, but the dearth of other cars on the roads is reminiscent of 4am.
515560	519560	Sitting at a red light with no one in sight, the feeling is amplified.
519560	525560	The turning weather must have pushed much of the population in contention to stay cozied up at home.
525560	529560	The beggars on the corners of the intersections, the runners on their morning route,
529560	534560	the loitering teenagers on pot, they were all just not around.
534560	540560	The protesters, so riled up and determined, have dispersed and are nowhere to be seen.
540560	548560	You can vaguely hear the sounds of other cars' life in contention over a heartbreaking, steady roar.
548560	554560	It would be so weirdly quiet if it weren't for the many animals still cohabiting in the ponds and creeks.
554560	559560	There are fewer than there were even yesterday, but the ones left are growing more vocal,
559560	563560	with the cold and lack of food seemingly abandoned by their owners.
563560	567560	You pull onto the highway, heading for the city with the sun at your back,
567560	574560	in whichever cars and bringing whichever stuff we decide during this next conversation.
574560	580560	Oh, well we had all the cars and all the stuff, including some stuff we didn't have before.
580560	581560	We took three semis.
581560	583560	We found it on the lookout.
583560	587560	We've got the whole Fast and Furious crew backing us up.
593560	599560	Maybe Glass's crew is pretty good with cars.
599560	600560	We'll find out.
600560	602560	Maybe they are.
604560	607560	Maybe one of them is named Vince.
607560	610560	I'm going all original and only the friends.
610560	612560	Vince Petrol.
613560	614560	What are we doing?
614560	618560	Well, before we leave town, well, while we're leaving town, I guess, I kind of want to call.
618560	623560	Phone calls is what I was thinking for the hour that you have in the cars on the way to the city.
623560	624560	Tight.
624560	625560	So, what are you driving?
625560	627560	How are you getting to the city?
627560	628560	Who's in what cars?
628560	629560	Five of us?
629560	630560	Does Rosemary have a car?
630560	633560	She does have a car in contention.
633560	638560	However, the three of you drove to the police station in Drew's Mini Cooper.
638560	639560	Okay.
639560	644560	Maybe we should make Rosemary drive to the city in her own car if she'll accept that.
644560	647560	And then we can take two cruisers or one cruiser.
647560	649560	Let's take one cruiser and then we can play 20 questions.
649560	650560	Yeah.
650560	651560	I like that idea.
651560	652560	Whereas two cruisers is better.
652560	655560	I just feel like two would give us some options.
655560	661560	We could always steal someone's car, like hijack a car, once we get there if we need it.
661560	663560	My cruiser is not at the station.
663560	664560	It's okay.
664560	668560	We're police from a very small town an hour and a half away.
668560	670560	I think my cruiser is there, right?
670560	671560	It is.
671560	672560	Is my cruiser there?
672560	673560	No.
673560	674560	We can take my cruiser.
674560	677560	I believe your cruisers are both in the impound lot.
677560	678560	They're totaled.
678560	679560	Yeah.
679560	681560	I guess we're taking one cruiser.
681560	682560	Cool.
682560	683560	Is mine totaled?
683560	684560	I thought I just left it at home from last night.
684560	686560	Was yours involved in the wreck at all?
686560	687560	I don't remember.
687560	689560	Mine got crushed by John Peters.
689560	691560	I did run into the back of his car, didn't I?
691560	692560	Yes.
692560	693560	Both of your cars were totaled in that wreck.
693560	694560	You're right.
694560	695560	How did I get home last night?
695560	696560	I guess you took me.
696560	697560	Probably.
697560	700560	For a long couple of days.
700560	701560	Yes.
701560	705560	I guess, realistically, we would only be taking yours.
705560	706560	Okay.
706560	713560	So, the three of you in the body of Agent Trent Chad, Agent Chad Trent, Agent Chad,
713560	715560	Agent Trent Chad.
715560	716560	You got it?
716560	721560	Are in the cruiser, and you have Rosemary driving her own car behind you?
721560	724560	We'll probably follow her, yeah, because we don't really know where we're going.
724560	725560	You know what?
725560	726560	That makes even more sense.
726560	728560	Hey, just follow us to your gang's hideout.
728560	729560	Okay.
729560	731560	What should we bring with us?
731560	732560	Weapons?
732560	733560	We've got all the weapons.
733560	734560	Yeah, my trunk's full of weapons.
734560	738560	So, you stop by Clark's house and pick up some heavy weaponry.
738560	739560	Hey, don't go inside.
739560	741560	What did we find at the robot house?
741560	743560	We found some cool weapons there, right?
743560	744560	Oh.
744560	745560	I had a list of them.
745560	747560	We had a sniper rifle that we gave to the old man.
747560	748560	Oh, I forgot about that sniper.
748560	750560	Yeah, wasn't there something else cool there?
750560	753560	There were machine guns, too, I think, or assault rifles.
753560	754560	Assault.
754560	756560	Did we find those after our fight with the giant?
756560	759560	No, because we gave the sniper to the dude while it was happening.
759560	760560	Yeah.
760560	767560	So, in the wooden crates marked US military that are now hidden in Clark Bishop's garage.
767560	768560	Garage?
768560	775560	Those crates included pistol, shotguns, rifles, a shoulder-mounted anti-aircraft weapon, an
775560	782560	EMP rifle, a grappling gun, a small gun that shoots tracers, lots of grenades, a sniper
782560	786560	rifle, a very, very tiny but powerful gun.
786560	788560	We load all of that into the truck.
788560	789560	Should we take it all?
789560	792560	Real quick, what is Clark's garage like?
792560	793560	Very clean.
793560	794560	Very clean.
794560	801560	Got a tool bench over on the side there with a lot of tools all hung in their places.
801560	802560	Everything.
802560	808560	And then these weapons are all just kind of haphazardly in a corner.
808560	811560	That one gun that you said shoots tracers, we clarify that you meant that they shot tracking
811560	813560	things, is that right?
813560	814560	Yeah.
814560	815560	Like a home-in device?
815560	816560	Like a GPS?
816560	817560	Like a GPS.
817560	818560	Oh, cool.
818560	820560	Should we take all this stuff?
820560	821560	I don't see why not.
821560	824560	I think we should take the EMP gun for sure since we fought a robot recently.
824560	825560	Yep.
825560	827560	And I think we should take those tracers since we'll be messing with the mob.
827560	830560	We might need to make sure we know where somebody goes.
830560	832560	I'd like the anti-aircraft gun too.
832560	835560	Yeah, in case of an emergency.
835560	838560	And the grappling gun because then we can climb stuff.
838560	840560	And all the grenades just in case.
840560	845560	I want to take my small but very powerful pistol as well.
845560	846560	Sniper too?
846560	847560	Oh yeah.
847560	850560	So yeah, let's pretty much take it all.
850560	853560	I'll take an assault rifle for myself as well.
853560	855560	And a shotgun.
855560	857560	Clark wants an assault rifle.
857560	859560	I think we all got our assault rifles.
859560	860560	Yeah.
860560	863560	And I got a pretty big trunk so we can fit it all back here.
863560	865560	Okay, that all sounds good.
865560	875560	And you also have at James the mill worker's house there was also a stash of weapons there.
875560	876560	Good ones?
876560	877560	Yeah, I don't remember what was there.
877560	879560	That's the house we're talking about, right?
879560	884560	Well no, so the military crates were from the storage units.
884560	885560	Oh, okay.
885560	887560	That's what I was talking about the one and what did we find there?
887560	896560	There you just found a bunch of pistols, silencers, shotguns, an assault rifle, and a sniper.
896560	897560	And body armor.
897560	898560	Oh, yeah.
898560	899560	Who has the body armor?
899560	900560	Was there more than one set?
900560	901560	You could each have body armor.
901560	903560	Let's strap one body armor please.
903560	904560	Yeah, one body armor.
904560	905560	Hey, you want to take it now?
905560	907560	Strap it on big boy.
907560	909560	Okay, so you strapped it on big boy.
909560	914560	And I think we are good to go.
914560	921560	You're going to have to take Rosemary in the cruiser with you to John's house to get her car.
921560	922560	Sure.
922560	929560	And so you pull up to the turn for John's house where you would then have to go down his long gravel driveway.
929560	934560	And sitting by the road is Rosemary's car and she'll get out.
934560	935560	Who has the best drive?
935560	937560	I believe it's John.
937560	938560	Yeah, you should be driving.
938560	941560	I was a professional waste car driver briefly.
941560	946560	Real fast, does that body armor have anything mechanically that we add to anything for us?
946560	948560	Yeah.
948560	949560	Cool.
949560	951560	I guess we'll find out.
951560	953560	Does it give you willpower points?
953560	955560	So I still have a negative 20 if I'm at two?
955560	956560	Yes.
956560	957560	Do we have any?
957560	958560	I want to bring cocaine with us.
958560	960560	Yeah, we got a little bit.
960560	965560	Yeah, I want to have a little baggie of coke on me to, you know, get through the day.
965560	970560	I don't want to do it yet since we're not really going to be rolling for, well, I don't know that.
970560	974560	Can I sleep in the car on the way to the city and regain willpower?
974560	976560	No, it's just an hour drive to the city.
976560	978560	There's no power nap mechanic?
978560	981560	My reasoning is that there's no power nap mechanic.
981560	983560	Thank you, Thomas.
983560	993560	And you can write down for your tactical body armor, you are going to have a five hit point buffer.
993560	994560	Tight.
994560	995560	What does that mean exactly?
995560	1000560	I'm writing plus five next to my current hit points and I'll take from there as I get hit.
1000560	1001560	Sounds good to me.
1001560	1003560	That gets me all the way up to 13.
1003560	1007560	Real hustlers don't sleep, we take naps.
1007560	1009560	Okay, so you guys are in the car.
1009560	1012560	Yeah, I want to call, fuck, what are their names?
1012560	1014560	The Glass Brothers.
1014560	1020560	No, our bros, they own the Daily Fuh and the Skeeters, or Clinkers.
1020560	1022560	I want to call Gary.
1022560	1023560	Gary, is it?
1023560	1024560	Harry and Gary.
1024560	1025560	Harry and Gary.
1025560	1026560	Harry and Gary.
1026560	1028560	Harry Clinker and Gary Daily.
1028560	1032560	Okay, yeah, I want to call Harry Clinker.
1032560	1036560	He's got an old fashioned phone.
1036560	1039560	I have a quick question for you.
1039560	1042560	Did you take the cell phone jammer with you that you found?
1042560	1043560	Yes, of course.
1043560	1044560	But we didn't turn it on.
1044560	1045560	See, it was already-
1045560	1046560	No, we didn't take it.
1046560	1047560	Turned on.
1047560	1053560	Okay, we turned it off.
1053560	1056560	Wait, where did we get a cell phone jammer?
1056560	1058560	It was in Chad's briefcase.
1058560	1059560	Oh, yeah.
1059560	1060560	I forgot about it.
1060560	1061560	What else was in his briefcase?
1061560	1062560	Was there anything else important?
1062560	1063560	It was the stuff on the table.
1063560	1065560	It's the map in front of you.
1065560	1066560	Oh, right, right, right.
1066560	1067560	And the list of-
1067560	1068560	Places.
1068560	1069560	Places in contention.
1069560	1070560	Cool.
1070560	1072560	Yeah, let's turn that cell phone jammer off.
1072560	1075560	See how many missed calls we have.
1075560	1081560	Okay, so you turn it off and then you call Harry Clinker.
1081560	1085560	And as you make this phone call, Luke, Keith's phone starts to buzz.
1085560	1086560	I answer it.
1086560	1090560	It is a couple voicemails and a text.
1090560	1095560	And let's cut to the phone call with John Pettymore and Harry Clinker.
1095560	1096560	Bring, bring.
1096560	1097560	Bring, bring.
1097560	1098560	Hey.
1098560	1099560	Hey, Harry.
1099560	1101560	How you doing today?
1101560	1102560	Slow day.
1102560	1104560	Well, I can imagine.
1104560	1107560	Do you know where all the people went?
1107560	1110560	Yeah, we've been talking about that.
1110560	1113560	Yeah, you know, it's crazy.
1113560	1118560	It's just like maybe it got cold and everybody went on holiday and people can't take the
1118560	1119560	cold anymore.
1119560	1125560	Well, sure, of course everybody leaves contention in mass droves once a year when it gets cold,
1125560	1128560	but usually that's mid-January after the holidays have died down.
1128560	1132560	Yeah, it's almost like everybody went a month early.
1132560	1136560	I don't find that to be a very satisfactory conclusion.
1136560	1137560	Oh, same.
1137560	1139560	You got any other working theories?
1139560	1147560	Well, you know, it could be a gang of disease, you know, it could be a gang disease or, you
1147560	1149560	know, it, I don't know.
1149560	1153560	To be honest, buddy, I was kind of hoping maybe you told people to get out of town.
1153560	1163560	Well, no, I was trying to get people to come down to Clinker's and have a Bud Light.
1163560	1165560	That sounds pretty good right about now, Harry.
1165560	1166560	Doesn't it?
1166560	1167560	Come on down.
1167560	1168560	We'll serve you up real good.
1168560	1169560	Is that Harry?
1169560	1170560	Is that him?
1170560	1171560	That's Harry.
1171560	1172560	Tell him I said hey.
1172560	1173560	Hey, Clark says hi.
1173560	1175560	Hey, tell Clark I, yeah, nice.
1175560	1177560	Does he say hi back?
1177560	1179560	Clark, yeah, he said nice.
1179560	1181560	Ah, I love Harry.
1181560	1183560	Yeah, he's a good guy.
1183560	1185560	Thank you.
1185560	1187560	What have you guys been doing?
1187560	1194560	Because I know, you know, a lot of the people around here were giving it to you pretty good
1194560	1200560	and, you know, I always stood up for you but, again, I keep my head down.
1200560	1202560	I don't really know what's going on.
1202560	1206560	Harry, honestly, we're only responsible for two or three of these disappearances.
1206560	1208560	The rest are not on us.
1208560	1210560	That's a really low percentage.
1210560	1211560	Right?
1211560	1212560	That's what I'm saying.
1212560	1213560	Those kids, that's bad.
1213560	1214560	That was, that was me and Clark.
1214560	1215560	We didn't mean nothing by it.
1215560	1216560	It was the goo.
1216560	1218560	I mean, but through our negligence.
1218560	1220560	I'm hitting John on the shoulder.
1220560	1222560	No, hey, hi.
1222560	1223560	Harry, Harry's.
1223560	1224560	Keith is learning.
1224560	1225560	Harry's our confidant, I think.
1225560	1227560	Harry, we fought a robot man.
1227560	1230560	A guy was eating his own foot.
1230560	1232560	I'm just giving wide eyes to John.
1232560	1235560	Who else is giving wide eyes to John?
1235560	1239560	Oh, it's Doug in the agent's body staring at John Lee anymore.
1239560	1245560	Yeah, I mean, on top of that, we put a man in a cat's body and then, no, we took a man
1245560	1249560	out of a cat's body into another man's body and put that man into a cat.
1250560	1251560	And look at Chad.
1251560	1253560	I'm like, this is how he and Harry talk.
1253560	1254560	It's just jokes.
1254560	1256560	They, it's one of their things.
1256560	1259560	Yeah, this is a long running bit, Chad.
1259560	1260560	Don't worry about it.
1260560	1262560	Chad knows that he is in a different.
1262560	1264560	What have you been up to?
1264560	1265560	Oh, wow.
1265560	1266560	Anything?
1266560	1272560	Well, I mean, just on all that, you know, that, John, that, that makes me worry about
1272560	1277560	you, you know, you know, if you're, if you're seeing all that kind of stuff, you, you may
1277560	1283560	want to talk to someone, you know, maybe a, you know, not to get too frank, but maybe
1283560	1290560	a spiritualist of some sort could, could assist you if, if you're dealing with, with people
1290560	1292560	and other people's bodies and stuff.
1292560	1296560	If you need a, if you need a medium, you know, you can always talk to Gary.
1296560	1297560	Yeah.
1297560	1298560	Is he around?
1298560	1301560	Well, I haven't seen him actually at all today.
1301560	1304560	He didn't come home last night, but he's always around.
1304560	1307560	He's probably just at his restaurant.
1307560	1308560	Right on.
1308560	1313560	I mean, well, don't leave plinkers, but you maybe should be concerned.
1313560	1318560	No, I don't, I don't say that.
1318560	1320560	Your husband may be dead.
1320560	1324560	Your husband's probably disappeared to the upside down.
1324560	1327560	Has Gary been acting weird at all lately?
1327560	1331560	Well, yeah, but, uh, you know, Gary's, uh, he's a weird bird.
1331560	1332560	But weirder.
1332560	1334560	Anything out of, out of the usual?
1334560	1340560	No, I mean, he's been meeting with his, uh, with his like group more often than usual,
1340560	1341560	but what group?
1341560	1348560	Oh, his old group of, uh, you know, spiritualists and, uh, you know, meta metaphysics thinkers.
1348560	1349560	Right.
1349560	1350560	Yeah.
1350560	1357560	Uh, you know, it's, uh, him, uh, Dr. Marie Jacobs, what's a, what's a lady's name?
1357560	1358560	Mildred Mitchell.
1358560	1363560	Yeah, the three of them, uh, meet up and talk about their, uh, eccentric books that
1363560	1365560	they read and such.
1365560	1367560	Well, that's, that's very good to know, Harry.
1367560	1372560	Well, he's always been into, you know, the occult and, uh, books of that nature.
1372560	1373560	Everybody knows that.
1373560	1374560	Yeah.
1374560	1379560	I think actually he's, he's who I meant to call, but this has been a good conversation.
1379560	1381560	It's crazy.
1382560	1383560	It's crazy.
1383560	1388560	It's like you ever think about like, maybe if you would've called Gary, you'd be talking
1388560	1394560	to him right now and, uh, he'd be saying that he hadn't seen me all morning.
1394560	1400560	Ain't it funny how life is and you'd be learning so many more things and you'd have more things
1400560	1401560	to go on.
1401560	1402560	Yeah.
1402560	1403560	Okay.
1403560	1406560	Yeah, I get your, I get, I get your point.
1406560	1410560	I mean, I'm not saying that you can't call Gary, you know, he's a good man to talk to.
1411560	1412560	I think he could help you.
1412560	1414560	I think I'm through some of these issues.
1414560	1415560	I think I'm going to do that.
1415560	1416560	I'm going to have to let you go.
1416560	1418560	Oh yeah, no, that's fine.
1418560	1420560	Uh, God, I'm bored.
1420560	1421560	All right.
1421560	1429560	Uh, have fun with your bar with the town to yourself.
1429560	1434560	It's uh, it's 9am so I guess I shouldn't have expected to be too busy yet.
1434560	1435560	You never know in contention.
1435560	1436560	Uh, okay.
1436560	1438560	Well, I really got to go, Harry.
1438560	1441560	Yeah, it seems like you're in a rush.
1441560	1442560	Okay.
1442560	1444560	You hang up first.
1444560	1450560	Did you, did you hang up?
1450560	1452560	Harry?
1452560	1456560	Harry, you hang up first.
1456560	1457560	Yeah, all right.
1457560	1459560	And then he clicks.
1459560	1462560	Quality role playing.
1462560	1464560	Harry's a goofball.
1464560	1465560	All right.
1465560	1467560	What did my texts say?
1467560	1468560	Uh, well, it's weird.
1468560	1471560	You just have a one text that you can read pretty quickly.
1471560	1474560	Uh, as you open your phone, it just says, I know.
1474560	1476560	And it's from John Lee Pettymore.
1476560	1477560	I...
1477560	1483560	It's four voicemails all from late at night this past evening from John Lee Pettymore.
1483560	1484560	Oh yeah.
1484560	1487560	It seems like weeks ago that I made those calls.
1487560	1490560	Uh, are there voicemails?
1490560	1491560	There are four voicemails.
1491560	1497560	I try to like hide my phone so that he doesn't know that I'm looking at him and I play the
1497560	1498560	first one.
1498560	1502560	I don't remember at all what I said to you in these voicemails.
1502560	1512560	I killed your brother.
1512560	1515560	He was a has bean.
1515560	1516560	God damn it.
1516560	1518560	Did you come up with a list?
1518560	1526560	Um, Keith, when you listen to the voicemails, Keith, it's John Lee Pettymore.
1526560	1531560	I got $5 million now, motherfucker, and I'm going to kick your ass.
1531560	1535560	Stupid piece of shit messing with my smokey DVDs.
1535560	1537560	You got damn bandit.
1537560	1539560	I'm the richest man in the world.
1539560	1543560	I'm going to stick a boot up your ass and then I'm going to fucking marry the turd that
1543560	1547560	comes out of that ass.
1547560	1548560	I put my phone away.
1548560	1550560	Get some text messages there, buddy.
1550560	1551560	Oh, just one.
1551560	1552560	Not important.
1552560	1554560	Let's focus on the matter at hand.
1554560	1555560	Guys, I'm sorry.
1555560	1559560	I know we just got underway, but I got to pee.
1559560	1562560	Let's not play a gas station.
1562560	1563560	Okay.
1563560	1564560	Vroom, vroom.
1564560	1569560	Basically, do you want to call anybody else on the way to the city?
1569560	1570560	I guess we should gather information.
1570560	1574560	We should tell Drew to just keep us posted, send him a text.
1574560	1579560	Hey buddy, keep, keep an eye on the town for us and let us know what your peepers peep.
1579560	1584560	If we did need to retcon, now would be the time before we get into the city.
1584560	1586560	So is there anything we are forgetting to bring with us?
1586560	1587560	We got weapons.
1587560	1591560	We got, did we bring the gun?
1591560	1592560	Retcon.
1592560	1603560	Oh, it might be way more fun to show up to the city without the gun.
1604560	1609560	I think we'd have to roll new characters if we walk into Marvin Glass's office without the gun.
1609560	1611560	I was so excited.
1611560	1613560	It wouldn't have left your purse in any reason.
1613560	1615560	We have the gun with us?
1615560	1616560	Yeah.
1616560	1617560	Oh, what else?
1617560	1621560	Is that the only thing with tubes, that you brought object with tubes?
1621560	1623560	Yeah, I don't think we feel comfortable.
1623560	1628560	Oh, well actually some of us might've dreamed how to use them.
1628560	1632560	Oh, I bet maybe let's bring the camera with us.
1632560	1643560	Oh, fuck.
1643560	1647560	If people have made it this far in the podcast, they're just like screaming.
1647560	1648560	Yeah, right.
1648560	1649560	Dumb motherfuckers.
1649560	1650560	No joke.
1650560	1654560	Yeah, well bring the gun and the camera, all the weapons.
1654560	1659560	There was a thread on the Critical Role subreddit and it was somebody who had posted all the loose ends that they've left.
1659560	1663560	And it was only like 10 and I was like, oh fuck, if you did that for us.
1663560	1667560	Everything makes sense.
1667560	1668560	Oh, I'm sure.
1668560	1669560	No, I just mean that.
1669560	1678560	We're not questioning your mystery, we're questioning our mystery tackling abilities.
1678560	1683560	Our ability to delegate and find conclusion.
1684560	1693560	I feel like the three of you are jugglers and instead of letting you get good at juggling the balls that you have, I just keep throwing more balls.
1693560	1694560	That's true.
1694560	1695560	More balls.
1695560	1700560	You're the worst audience for a juggler.
1700560	1701560	So.
1701560	1702560	Okay.
1702560	1706560	I don't want to have another 20 minute conversation with Gary.
1706560	1707560	Why?
1707560	1708560	No, no, no.
1708560	1712560	I mean for the listeners.
1712560	1719560	Okay, most of this episode is just Thomas talking to Zach on an imaginary cell phone.
1719560	1720560	It's a good one, guys.
1720560	1721560	Buckle up.
1721560	1724560	Luke doesn't seem bored at all, so I think we're good.
1724560	1729560	He's literally cleaning out his ear with a mechanical pencil.
1729560	1731560	It's fucking nasty, dude.
1731560	1733560	Yeah, who knows where your ear's been?
1733560	1735560	I put those pencils in my mouth.
1735560	1739560	I put them in my ear.
1739560	1741560	Hey guys.
1741560	1745560	Doug looks over at you wide-eyed.
1745560	1754560	I am here so that we can figure this out so that I can get back into my body.
1754560	1755560	Correct.
1755560	1756560	Yes.
1756560	1758560	I just want to make that clear.
1758560	1760560	Unless you like an upgrade.
1760560	1761560	I am...
1761560	1762560	Younger model.
1762560	1766560	...interested if this is...
1766560	1769560	He like rubs his fingers together symbolizing money.
1769560	1770560	Mm-hmm.
1771560	1774560	I will help you in any way I possibly can.
1774560	1776560	Oh, yeah.
1776560	1778560	I think we could probably work something out.
1778560	1782560	We happen to have $5 million sitting down at the station.
1782560	1787560	I shouldn't have told you the amount that really hinders my negotiating.
1787560	1789560	I forget I said anything.
1789560	1791560	Clark, do you want to take...
1791560	1793560	Clark starts pulling out his wallet.
1793560	1794560	I got a...
1794560	1795560	Looks like a 20.
1795560	1798560	That's a good start.
1798560	1801560	So, just figured I'd let you know.
1801560	1804560	If you want to have another phone call with this other person,
1804560	1806560	you can go ahead and throw it on speakerphone.
1806560	1809560	That way all three of you can talk to the man on the other end.
1809560	1813560	What a smart idea.
1813560	1814560	God damn.
1814560	1816560	Doug, this is why we pay you.
1816560	1820560	Chad is the embodiment of everything Zach has wanted to say to us,
1820560	1826560	but couldn't because he didn't have a character voice to do it in.
1826560	1828560	My name is Doug.
1828560	1830560	Oh, yeah. Chad Doug.
1830560	1833560	Okay, let's call up Gary.
1838560	1839560	Ring it.
1842560	1846560	You hear a click on the other line as the phone is answered,
1846560	1849560	and you hear Gary Daley saying,
1849560	1853560	I told you, you old witch, you're just going crazy.
1853560	1855560	That's all and that's fine.
1855560	1857560	And we can deal with that hello.
1857560	1859560	Hey, Gary. Gary Daley.
1859560	1861560	Yes, John Lee Pettymore. Speak of the devil.
1861560	1864560	Yeah. Well, funny you should say that.
1864560	1867560	Hey, I've actually got us all here on speaker.
1867560	1868560	Boys, you want to say hi?
1868560	1869560	Hey, Gary.
1869560	1870560	Hey, what's going on?
1870560	1871560	Oh, hello, Clark. Hello, Keith.
1871560	1874560	There's also a man named Doug here, but that's just more...
1874560	1876560	You didn't really need to know that.
1876560	1878560	Well, hello, Doug. How are you?
1878560	1879560	Doug, talk to the man.
1879560	1882560	Oh, I'd really rather not do this.
1883560	1885560	That's fair. Gary.
1885560	1888560	So, first of all, Harry, I think, is a little worried about you.
1888560	1890560	You might just shoot him a text.
1890560	1891560	Oh, gosh.
1891560	1893560	You know what, actually, Harry wasn't...
1893560	1894560	Well, I shouldn't tell you that.
1894560	1895560	I was worried about you.
1895560	1897560	I wasn't sure we'd get a hold of you.
1897560	1899560	Well, I just... Oh, gosh, yeah.
1899560	1901560	Just seeing the time now, it completely slipped my mind.
1901560	1903560	I'll absolutely text him.
1903560	1904560	I'll put you on speaker while I do it.
1904560	1905560	Gary, where are you?
1905560	1907560	Yeah. What'd you say about a witch?
1907560	1910560	What? Oh, no, I'm just hanging out with a friend.
1911560	1912560	Where at?
1912560	1913560	Oh, at her house.
1913560	1914560	Yeah.
1914560	1915560	Do you know Mildred Mitchell?
1915560	1916560	We sure do.
1916560	1917560	Yeah, I'm over...
1917560	1918560	Is she there?
1918560	1919560	Yeah, she's here. I'm over at Mildred's house.
1919560	1921560	Are we on speakerphone now?
1921560	1922560	God, no.
1924560	1926560	No, she's actually... She's having a bit of a breakdown.
1926560	1928560	I'm over here trying to work her through it.
1928560	1929560	Real quick.
1929560	1930560	Who was Mildred Mitchell?
1930560	1932560	She lived across the street from John Peters.
1932560	1934560	She was one of the first NPCs we ever talked with.
1934560	1935560	Pot smoking.
1935560	1938560	Oh, and it's her daughter who used the gun and went crazy.
1938560	1939560	Right.
1939560	1940560	Tilly D?
1940560	1941560	Granddaughter.
1941560	1942560	Granddaughter.
1942560	1943560	Tilly B.
1943560	1944560	Tilly B.
1944560	1945560	Tilly D.
1945560	1946560	Hey.
1946560	1947560	Hello?
1947560	1948560	Yeah, hey, so kind of...
1948560	1950560	You were on mute there for a second.
1950560	1954560	Gary, Harry kind of spilled the beans about your coven or whatever it is.
1954560	1957560	Oh, well, I mean, it's not much of a secret.
1957560	1958560	I don't know.
1958560	1959560	It's a book club of sorts.
1959560	1962560	Of sorts seems to be the operative word.
1962560	1964560	Yeah, we're a sorcerer's guild.
1964560	1965560	Yeah.
1965560	1966560	Wow.
1966560	1967560	Interesting.
1967560	1969560	Wait, have you tortured anything recently?
1969560	1970560	Oh, God, no.
1970560	1972560	No, it's been years.
1972560	1976560	Well, all right, Gary, you might have noticed the world's gone to shit.
1976560	1977560	Yeah, yeah.
1977560	1979560	People are not around.
1979560	1983560	Yeah, and obviously something supernatural seems to be involved.
1983560	1985560	I couldn't agree more.
1985560	1986560	You got any theories on that?
1986560	1988560	Well, I have five.
1988560	1989560	Let me run them down for you.
1989560	1991560	Fuck, I said five.
1991560	1993560	You can say three.
1993560	1994560	Three.
1994560	1996560	I have three theories.
1996560	1999560	Let me run them down for you.
1999560	2005560	My first theory, the strongest in my opinion, is that Jesus came back, right?
2005560	2006560	Now, don't get me wrong.
2006560	2008060	He's not like the normal Jesus.
2008060	2010560	No, this is like a cool Jesus.
2010560	2016560	And he came back and he took care of all of the weird people, the normies.
2016560	2017560	You know what I mean?
2017560	2018560	Yeah, I think he just knocked them out.
2018560	2019560	Now, that's my first theory.
2019560	2022560	Now, my second theory is that they all left.
2022560	2024560	They all just moved.
2024560	2027560	You know, I think a lot of them were really upset with the police work around here.
2027560	2032560	The jobs had been drying up for some time, so maybe everyone just decided to leave at
2032560	2033560	the same time.
2033560	2034560	I don't know.
2034560	2035560	Who knows?
2035560	2039560	And then my third theory is that, you know, cults.
2039560	2042560	So, probably a cult.
2042560	2043560	So that's the thing.
2043560	2046560	We're not overly familiar with cults, but it seems like you are.
2046560	2051560	Have you seen any in the area or signs of cult activity?
2051560	2054560	Have you been to the first Church of Contingent?
2054560	2057560	That's pretty pithy, but this is a Christian town.
2057560	2059560	I'll ask you to mind your tongue.
2059560	2061560	Okay, you know what I mean though.
2061560	2063560	They all repeat each other and stuff.
2063560	2064560	It's fucking weird.
2064560	2065560	Alright, alright, alright.
2065560	2067560	Let's not rock a boat.
2067560	2069560	Whatever.
2069560	2070560	Jesus freak.
2070560	2074560	Well, John Lee Pettymore is not going to apologize for his faith.
2074560	2076560	Should we just tell him what we think is going on?
2076560	2077560	Well, yeah.
2077560	2080560	Why are you asking, I mean, me about these things?
2080560	2083560	Because it's kind of your bag, man.
2083560	2084560	You seem like a spooky boy.
2084560	2088560	Well, I've read a lot of books, but none of them seem to have been true for a while.
2088560	2089560	So, uh.
2089560	2091560	Okay, but back to the cult thing.
2091560	2092560	Sure.
2092560	2095560	Besides the church, what cults have you seen?
2095560	2096560	Oh, I don't know.
2096560	2101560	I mean, honestly, that woman Carrie Pages who had the protesters all riled up against you.
2101560	2104560	I think, you know, she might have had something going on.
2104560	2108560	She had a lot of power, you know, with her seat on the city council.
2108560	2115560	And, uh, she was really getting people angry about your lack of attention to detail of the police work and contention.
2115560	2117560	This is all my fault. I couldn't find her dog.
2117560	2119560	You know what, you're probably right, Clark.
2119560	2121560	But we'll deal with that later.
2121560	2124560	For now, just shoulder the burden of your shame.
2124560	2126560	It's the goddamn case I couldn't close.
2126560	2128560	And get on with the job.
2128560	2134560	The one case I couldn't crack is that fucking dog.
2134560	2137560	Okay, well, Gary, you've been about as much help as Harry.
2137560	2140560	Well, actually, you did give us that Carrie Pages lead. That was pretty good.
2140560	2142560	Hey, Gary, how's Mildred doing?
2142560	2150560	Oh, I don't. She, you know, she keeps staring at this picture that she has and she thinks that it changed somehow.
2150560	2151560	I don't know. It's crazy.
2151560	2156560	She, like, believes that her histories have been split somehow.
2156560	2157560	Does that make sense?
2157560	2161560	She doesn't understand. She thinks that she's a part of a different reality.
2161560	2163560	I'm sorry, Keith. Did I cut you off there?
2163560	2165560	What was the picture of and what is it of now?
2165560	2169560	Oh, well, it's just a picture of the founders of the town.
2169560	2176560	And she is dead certain that Silas Cole looks different than he did before.
2176560	2186560	And I, you know, if you're asking my opinion, I think he looks pretty similar and maybe the exact same.
2186560	2189560	Probably the exact same.
2189560	2195560	But she also is claiming that, you know, did you hear about her granddaughter going missing?
2195560	2197560	Yeah, we knew about that.
2197560	2199560	So she's yeah.
2199560	2202560	Can you can you if she's willing to come to the phone, that'd be great.
2202560	2207560	But you could ask her if you want to describe the difference between the two people.
2207560	2209560	Sure. Yeah, no, she's pretty distraught.
2209560	2215560	But so I can't remember exactly what her voice sounds like right now.
2215560	2222560	She's crying a lot and she just keeps saying that he's not as attractive as he used to be used to be far more attractive.
2222560	2227560	And now he's a bit dumber looking, but similar, but stupider.
2227560	2238560	And and then she's claiming that there in the reflection of a glass part in the picture is her granddaughter, Tildy B. Mitchell.
2238560	2244560	But, you know, that's just crazy because there's no way, obviously, and she's just losing her shit.
2244560	2248560	Yeah, Gary, it sounds like she's pretty distraught.
2248560	2250560	I'm going to take you off speaker for just one second.
2250560	2255560	Beep. This sounds like something sounds like we're getting real close to this.
2255560	2260560	Yeah. People like this has some sort of connection with people are being Ray and back in time.
2260560	2263560	Ray and who's the girl that died?
2263560	2268560	Ari Ari and Ray and all the other names potentially.
2268560	2273560	I might have to do with the split timelines, but it seems like we kind of know where these people are going now.
2273560	2277560	Go ahead and roll sanity for me. Wow. It's really hard to pass sanity when you have.
2277560	2280560	Can you give me that blue set or just, yeah, whatever.
2280560	2287560	Fifty three on a twenty six. I fail. I fail. I fail with a sixty nine. Sixty two. I fail as well.
2287560	2292560	Oh, nice. Clark, you don't lose. I'm not as sexually as Joe. You're all sixty nine.
2292560	2296560	You gain sanity. Dude, honestly, you're back to full sanity.
2296560	2302560	If you rolled like it doesn't have to be a positive, but if you roll sixty nine, nothing bad can happen.
2302560	2307560	It's like a fluke sick, like half success.
2307560	2313560	That's really interesting, though, because when you do sixty nine, something very bad could happen.
2313560	2318560	It's true. It never does. It's just always unsatisfying for both parties.
2318560	2322560	Clark, you lose no sanity. The other two, you lose one sanity each.
2322560	2327560	And having this realization, you were both, I think, good to go.
2327560	2334560	Right. I mean, we can talk about what you think that means, but it seems like you believe these people are going back in time.
2334560	2337560	I think that's going to make you question reality.
2337560	2341560	Definitely. I question reality.
2341560	2345560	I do. I do have one more question for Gary before we let him go.
2345560	2348560	Are you still on mute? You hear vaguely.
2348560	2352560	I'll switch him back. Hey, Gary, can you tell me a little bit about your grandfather?
2352560	2356560	Well, yeah, he's a quiet man. He sang a lot.
2356560	2359560	Would you ever use the word wizard to describe him?
2359560	2362560	Oh, yeah. I had a little dream last night and the boys.
2362560	2364560	Tell me about it. The boys can hear it.
2364560	2370560	Well, I seem to have a memory from my past, but from a time before I could have memories, it was me.
2370560	2374560	And I think Clark is little babies in clinkers.
2374560	2381560	And you were putting some kind of protection on us. And you said your your grandpa was a wizard who had told you about it.
2381560	2386560	And you'd hope you hoped it would work. Did that happen, Gary?
2386560	2390560	Well, yeah. How did you see that?
2390560	2399560	I have the second sight, Gary. It's become plain to me over the past two days, but that's neither here nor there.
2399560	2404560	John, I've never told you this. Keith Clark, you're on the phone as well.
2404560	2405560	I'm here.
2405560	2406560	Yeah?
2406560	2413560	I was always too afraid to actually let you know because I thought maybe it would have some sort of reaction.
2413560	2415560	You're all of our father? Are you our daddy?
2415560	2423560	But my grandfather, he gave me this book and it had three pages left in it.
2423560	2430560	And I was to read those pages after tearing them out of the book and then spill blood upon your heads.
2430560	2438560	Now, I know that sounds crazy, but when I did that, the words dance like magic on the page.
2438560	2444560	And they came off like sparks. And it was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
2444560	2450560	And it surrounded you in this light, this bathe of light.
2450560	2458560	And I did it because my grandpa told me that the three of you, the three of you are the key to everything.
2458560	2462560	Now, I know that sounds extreme, but I did my part.
2462560	2468560	I don't know what your part is, but it's time for you to take care of it. Seems like to me.
2468560	2472560	Wow, Gary. That's heavy.
2472560	2475560	Gary, did your grandpa tell you what that did?
2475560	2479560	He just said fortune would be on your side.
2479560	2481560	It's a spell to give you 100 luck.
2481560	2483560	Well, thank you for telling us that.
2483560	2487560	He also mentioned it was a spell to give you 100 luck.
2488560	2490560	My mind is blown right now.
2490560	2492560	You finally have been for a 100-inch cop.
2492560	2494560	But anyway, Gary.
2494560	2499560	I don't know what kind of jokes John Lee Fadymore makes, but I think they're probably like that.
2499560	2501560	Better ones.
2501560	2504560	He does, yeah. He's smarter than that.
2504560	2510560	All right, well, good luck to y'all. I really need to get Mildred calmed down here.
2510560	2511560	You do that.
2511560	2515560	She does not like you all. Let me tell you, you need to stay away from her, I'm guessing.
2515560	2518560	All right, thanks for the heads up on that. And thank you for everything else, Gary.
2518560	2520560	You boys, thanks for blessing us.
2520560	2521560	Yeah, thanks for the magic.
2521560	2522560	Those children.
2522560	2523560	I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.
2523560	2525560	I don't know if I would have been able to handle it any earlier than this.
2525560	2528560	Yeah, three days ago I wouldn't have believed you, Gary, so.
2528560	2530560	Well, sounds like this is the time.
2530560	2531560	Yeah.
2531560	2533560	He's still on the phone, isn't he? Or did we hang up?
2533560	2535560	Let's do a hang up just in case we haven't.
2535560	2536560	Click.
2538560	2539560	Perfect.
2539560	2543560	Keith reaches over and turns off your phone as he's saying bye.
2543560	2544560	Wow.
2544560	2548560	We know we're all protected by a wizard's magic.
2548560	2549560	From what, though?
2549560	2550560	Which is nice.
2550560	2551560	Evil, presumably.
2551560	2552560	Okay, I like that.
2552560	2554560	Can you guys roll sanity for me?
2556560	2557560	Ninety-one.
2557560	2558560	I pass.
2558560	2559560	With a four.
2559560	2560560	Nice.
2560560	2562560	Clark, you lose no sanity.
2562560	2563560	Nice.
2563560	2564560	Jon, you lose one more sanity.
2564560	2566560	I rolled an 18 on a 17.
2566560	2568560	Oh, fuck, that's so brutal.
2568560	2571560	You lose another sanity and you're down to 16.
2572560	2573560	That's the point I'm getting to, though.
2573560	2574560	Where are you guys at right now?
2574560	2575560	Twenty-four.
2575560	2577560	Like, there's no fucking way to roll on this.
2577560	2578560	I've got a 26.
2578560	2584560	Actually, there's literally a one in four chance, but there's not literally a one in four chance, but there's so nearly.
2584560	2585560	So close.
2585560	2594560	Well, I don't know what to think about having blood poured on me as a baby, but if it helps me not get attacked by evil spirits.
2594560	2596560	I like the part about the words dancing off the page.
2596560	2597560	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
2597560	2599560	It's like a Disney movie.
2599560	2600560	Are you guys buying that shit?
2600560	2603560	That he saw light around us and dancing and words?
2603560	2604560	There's no way.
2604560	2607560	I have seen stranger shit happen these past few days.
2607560	2609560	Yeah, I'll give you that.
2609560	2613560	Okay, well, all I can tell you is they seem real sincere about it in the dream.
2613560	2621560	I didn't dream the part about the magic words, but I did see him put the blood on our heads and he seemed to be pretty into what he was doing.
2621560	2624560	Would we know his grandpa's name?
2624560	2628560	Is he somebody in our maybe town's history that we would know or anything like that?
2628560	2630560	Or just because we know Gary so well?
2630560	2631560	Yeah, of course.
2631560	2635560	I've changed Gary's grandpa's diapers.
2635560	2637560	Gingerfrid daily.
2637560	2638560	Gingerfrid?
2638560	2639560	Gingerfrid.
2639560	2640560	Gingerfrid, I like it.
2640560	2643560	We called him Fred.
2643560	2644560	Those who knew him.
2644560	2647560	Well, is there anything else we need to do before we head?
2647560	2648560	I guess we're heading there already.
2648560	2650560	Yeah, we are on the highway.
2650560	2653560	This whole fucking episode is just...
2653560	2658560	The filter on the colorization changes as you drive into the city.
2658560	2663560	Everything is drab and gray with a sickly green tint to it.
2663560	2666560	The streets are covered in trash and spilled liquids.
2666560	2672560	There is a scent in the air like someone left out cheese in a colostomy bag on every corner.
2672560	2680560	The faces of the buildings are slathered in billboards and the faces of the people bumbling about are bloated and lifeless.
2681560	2688560	In a strange opposition to all this depressive scenery, there are beautiful flowers in every shade and shape,
2688560	2695560	growing in every otherwise empty alleyway and out of many cracks in the sidewalks and roads.
2695560	2704560	Rosemary and her runner car leads you downtown to one of the tallest buildings scraping the putrid sky.
2704560	2710560	This towering building has a granite finish and the reflections wave as you approach,
2710560	2716560	turning down into a small parking garage below this massive stone high rise.
2716560	2724560	Down in this parking garage, there are women in suits touching their earpieces like cliche security guards standing against the wall near the entrance.
2724560	2734560	There's an elevator door in a nearby corner and Rosemary parks, gets out, walks over, and presses the button and it lights up green.
2734560	2739560	Hey Rosemary, I know we're about to do some important stuff, but is the city always this floral?
2739560	2741560	Yeah, I asked an answer.
2741560	2745560	Okay, I get out of the car once we park. I guess we're already out of the car.
2745560	2748560	Yeah, we're on the way up the elevator. Or we're waiting for the elevator.
2748560	2750560	So what floor are we going to?
2750560	2752560	Eh, it'll take you.
2752560	2763560	The door opens and the elevator's interior walls, floor, and ceiling are this like beautiful onyx and it's very reflective.
2763560	2765560	Nice elevator you got here.
2767560	2770560	Doug is standing next to you guys.
2770560	2772560	Should I come with you?
2772560	2774560	Yeah, you might as well.
2774560	2777560	Should I wait? It's up to you guys. I'll do whatever you want.
2777560	2783560	Hey Chad, you might look through all your pockets and if there's anything that says you're an FBI agent, leave it in the car?
2783560	2786560	Or should we bring them with us?
2786560	2789560	Let's bring them with us for protection, for power.
2789560	2795560	Yeah, we've got, we'll say we're not just a small town PD. We're working with the feds, you know?
2795560	2797560	Oh yeah, I think they'd probably give you leverage.
2797560	2799560	I dig it. Thanks Rosemary.
2799560	2805560	Also, I've got, I have the very tiny but very powerful gun like hidden away in my pants.
2805560	2806560	Nice.
2806560	2807560	What about your weapons?
2807560	2813560	I've got like my pistol on my hip, but just in case I like try to take stuff away from me.
2813560	2815560	Okay.
2818560	2819560	What?
2819560	2821560	Thomas made a dick joke.
2821560	2823560	My weapons? Is that what you said?
2823560	2827560	You're like, I have a very tiny but very powerful thing in my pants.
2827560	2829560	I didn't catch it either.
2829560	2831560	That's good though.
2832560	2839560	We don't know what kind of jokes John Lee Pettymore makes, but we know what kind of jokes Thomas makes.
2839560	2844560	All right, so the four of you get in and the door closes.
2844560	2849560	As it's closing, I'll see you when you're finished, I guess.
2849560	2859560	In this elevator, there are no buttons, no numbers, no emergency phone, just this shimmering black mirror on all sides.
2859560	2860560	I hope it works.
2860560	2862560	Wait, so Rosemary didn't get in the elevator with us?
2862560	2863560	That is correct.
2863560	2864560	Okay.
2864560	2865560	So it's just the four of us.
2865560	2866560	Okay.
2866560	2867560	Are we moving up?
2867560	2868560	Nope.
2868560	2869560	Are we moving at all?
2869560	2870560	Nope.
2870560	2871560	I touched the wall.
2871560	2872560	It's cold.
2872560	2873560	It's a cold wall, guys.
2873560	2880560	John Clark says, elevator up.
2880560	2881560	Engage.
2881560	2882560	Engage.
2882560	2885560	Elevator go.
2885560	2889560	Elevator skyward.
2889560	2893560	Clark jumps up and down.
2893560	2894560	Do I feel a give?
2894560	2895560	It doesn't move at all.
2895560	2896560	It's just all black walls, right?
2896560	2897560	Yep.
2897560	2901560	So I hold the gun up to where cameras might be.
2901560	2903560	I'm like, hey, we got what you're seeking.
2903560	2905560	We seek an audience.
2905560	2907560	One of the walls opens up.
2907560	2908560	What do we see?
2909560	2914560	You see a small room and a spotlight coming down on a figure behind a desk.
2914560	2915560	I walk in.
2915560	2917560	He's really killing it with the atmosphere.
2917560	2918560	Do you all walk in?
2918560	2919560	All things considered.
2919560	2920560	Yeah, I walk in.
2920560	2921560	How small a room?
2921560	2922560	12 by 8.
2922560	2923560	Nice.
2923560	2924560	What happens when you walk in?
2924560	2925560	Yeah, I go in.
2925560	2926560	The door closes behind you.
2926560	2931560	In front of you, there is a figure with a massive frame.
2931560	2934560	It is completely gaunt.
2934560	2936560	No muscle or fat.
2936560	2941560	You can just imagine skin stretched across long bones.
2941560	2947560	They're dressed in a fitted black tuxedo, and the spotlight shows off a bright red bowtie,
2947560	2952560	but only reaches to illuminate the lower half of this person's face.
2952560	2955560	The skin on the chin is almost translucent.
2955560	2956560	No hair.
2956560	2964560	Not even a slight shadow of facial hair can be seen on either side of two thin, bright red lips.
2964560	2967560	Actually, there's really no lips at all.
2967560	2974560	Just this candy red lipstick messily encircling a round hole above the sharp see-through chin
2974560	2978560	when the orifice begins to move.
2978560	2980560	Hello?
2980560	2983560	I am Marvin Glass.
2983560	2986560	I know who you are.
2986560	2989560	Do you know why you are here?
2989560	2990560	Kind of.
2990560	2992560	Not particularly.
2992560	2993560	We think so?
2993560	2995560	Why do you think we're here?
2995560	3002560	Ferguson Fucking Beans was trying to buy my lost cocaine off a contention police officer.
3002560	3006560	I wasn't going to let it get stolen again.
3006560	3010560	That's why I sent Rosemary to take the money back.
3010560	3012560	Money that is rightfully mine.
3012560	3015560	Oh, we kind of thought you sent Rosemary after your boys.
3015560	3017560	You know they're a missing rat.
3017560	3018560	Or one of them is.
3018560	3020560	And the other one's a lunatic now.
3020560	3023560	I am fully aware of my son's condition.
3023560	3027560	Yeah, I don't know anything about that cocaine deal.
3027560	3029560	Who stole the cocaine from you originally?
3029560	3035560	You don't know anything about the cocaine deal that you were one half of?
3035560	3037560	Nope.
3037560	3038560	I sure don't.
3038560	3042560	Who stole the cocaine originally from you?
3042560	3045560	That's not what we're here to discuss.
3045560	3047560	Yeah, we're not here about the cocaine period.
3047560	3049560	We're here about the gun.
3050560	3059560	No, I specifically sent Rosemary to take the money from the deal and bring it back to me.
3059560	3064560	I thought that is why you were here is to bring my money back and pay your pendants.
3064560	3066560	I step up next to John.
3066560	3068560	Rosemary definitely told her she was looking for the gun.
3068560	3070560	Yeah, she was pretty obsessed with that gun.
3070560	3071560	Doug.
3071560	3072560	Yes.
3072560	3073560	Doug, come on.
3073560	3074560	I need to talk to you real quick.
3074560	3078560	Okay, so I guess you guys walk into the corner of this dark room.
3078560	3079560	Alright, Doug.
3079560	3084560	What we need you to say is that the FBI has taken that money.
3084560	3086560	They confiscated it all.
3086560	3090560	If he asks you any details, we'll interrupt, alright?
3090560	3097560	If you get in over your head, but I need you to say that that money is gone so we can get this conversation on the gun.
3097560	3099560	Okay, yeah, sure.
3099560	3101560	Alright, and you guys walk back.
3102560	3117560	Sir, ma'am, I do believe that that money that you are speaking of is currently part of an ongoing investigation with the FBI and we have confiscated that money.
3117560	3119560	Yeah, what he said.
3119560	3120560	Yeah.
3121560	3125560	That is not what Rosemary has told me.
3125560	3128560	She said that you guys have the money.
3128560	3130560	You brought it here for me.
3130560	3133560	Rosemary didn't say anything to us about some money.
3133560	3135560	She said you really wanted that gun.
3135560	3137560	That's what we brought.
3137560	3141560	We're not here to talk about financial matters.
3141560	3143560	We're here to talk about your son.
3143560	3144560	Yeah.
3144560	3147560	Oh, no, no, no.
3149560	3150560	I am sorry.
3151560	3153560	What I meant to say was...
3153560	3167560	I am saddened by poor Alfred's condition that he must babble on about this gun, but that is not why you are here.
3167560	3171560	Sir, we're not actually here about Alfred and the gun necessarily.
3171560	3174560	We're here about getting Jermaine back.
3174560	3176560	From what, the dead?
3176560	3177560	From the past.
3177560	3178560	Go on.
3178560	3179560	We have a theory.
3179560	3183560	Yeah, well, it probably requires some backstories.
3183560	3188560	Something's descended upon contention, the town we're from.
3188560	3193560	And it seems to be spreading and it's not going to be long before it gets to the city.
3193560	3195560	It took your boy.
3195560	3199560	We think we can get him back, but we need your help.
3199560	3205560	We shouldn't be asking for the resources of a criminal organization, I know that.
3206560	3209560	But we don't have any other options.
3209560	3215560	The FBI, you know, Doug here, Chad here is taking us seriously, but his higher-ups aren't.
3215560	3218560	So they're not providing us with resources.
3218560	3222560	What's happened to your boy has happened to a lot of people in our town and we're trying to get him back.
3222560	3225560	If you can help us out, we can get your boy back to you.
3226560	3234560	I believe that you underestimate my love of money.
3235560	3244560	And overestimate my love for my pitiful son.
3244560	3247560	Well, that is precisely the miscalculation we've made here, yeah.
3247560	3249560	We have made a horrible mistake.
3249560	3252560	Right. Rosemary really harped up that gun thing.
3252560	3256560	It seemed like the one thing you wanted in the world, so we thought we could offer that to you.
3256560	3262560	It seems that Rosemary must be taken care of in a different light.
3262560	3265560	Yeah, she just walked away from five million dollars, by the way.
3265560	3266560	I'm sorry.
3266560	3269560	Just set it down when I asked her to. She could have brought you some of that money.
3269560	3274560	He is visually agitated by you saying that.
3274560	3276560	Clark wants to scan the room, are we alone?
3276560	3279560	It seems to be just the four of you and this man.
3279560	3281560	Do you have any more lights you could turn on?
3281560	3289560	Good to see you, Keith. You know, I didn't expect you to be so effective when I hired you,
3289560	3293560	everyone's favorite fuck-up, to murder your own brother.
3293560	3295560	What are you talking about?
3295560	3301560	It's a very good murder, Keith. You know, we fully expected your niece to have to finish the job.
3301560	3306560	And out of the darkness, a teenage girl approaches and stands next to Marvin Glass.
3306560	3311560	Keith, she flips you double birds and smiles as Marvin continues.
3311560	3316560	She is being trained by a woman for the history books.
3317560	3319560	And a third figure comes into the light.
3319560	3325560	This woman is shaped like a football with spiky white hair frantically flopping atop a pointy head.
3325560	3332560	She is wearing a large white lab coat and those big chunky evil scientist goggles that evil scientists wear.
3332560	3339560	This pair is wonky, one goggle pointing down and away to accommodate the odd head shape of the wearer.
3339560	3350560	This mad scientist stands tall behind Francis Beans, slowly tapping her long, wobbly fingers against Keith Sneese's collarbones.
3352560	3356560	Keith, you didn't tell us you were involved in some series of unfortunate events shit.
3356560	3359560	I don't have any idea what they're talking about.
3359560	3361560	Me neither, with my thang.
3361560	3363560	Francis, it's nice to see you.
3363560	3367560	Francis and the woman behind her back away slowly.
3367560	3372560	And once again, all you can see is the front half of the figure standing before you.
3373560	3375560	Keith, if you're lying to us, god damn it.
3375560	3378560	I look at the... Is this a woman or a man?
3378560	3379560	It's Marvin.
3379560	3386560	Okay, I look at Marvin, I look at both my co-police officers and I look at Marvin and I go, I think you owe me some money.
3386560	3392560	Your winnings will be collected if you prove yourself worthy.
3393560	3399560	John, I will help you if you prove yourself capable.
3400560	3404560	Clark, I'm sorry you had to be here.
3411560	3416560	The room begins to fill with a noxious gas.
3416560	3419560	Clark is running back to where the door was, at least.
3419560	3421560	It is closed.
3421560	3423560	He's pulling and pushing and doing whatever.
3423560	3427560	It's an elevator door, so you're fingering at the seams.
3427560	3429560	Okay.
3429560	3430560	Well, I mean...
3430560	3431560	That's a bad word.
3433560	3435560	I'm fingering the fuck out of the seams.
3435560	3439560	We are really earning that explicit tag.
3440560	3448560	Okay, so with my last bit of consciousness, I turned to Keith and I said, did you sell us out, you dirty son of a bitch?
3448560	3450560	I would never.
3450560	3452560	And then I pass out.
3452560	3454560	How convenient.
3454560	3460560	Congratulations on making the mob boss way fucking scarier than I thought it would be.
3460560	3462560	Yeah, that was fucking dope.
3462560	3464560	Yeah, very cool.
3468560	3472560	You wake up to the feeling of cold metal awkwardly pressing against your skin.
3472560	3481560	It is abrasively loud, both from jubilant hollering and pulsing bass that shakes your chest and ribcage with each boom.
3481560	3487560	You have each been crammed into individual cages made entirely of metal bars.
3487560	3493560	These cages are hanging from the ceiling and outline this smoky, dimly lit room.
3493560	3496560	There are three other cages next to your own.
3497560	3503560	They are each inhabited by a person who has also been stripped down to their underwear, just as you have.
3503560	3514560	There is one adult man that you do not recognize, one child, a boy, and also Doug in the body of Agent Chad.
3514560	3519560	The man is massive and barely fits. His muscles bulge and press against the inside of the cage.
3519560	3527560	And the child, the boy, he looks like he could slip right between the metal bars because he is so underfed and sickly looking.
3527560	3530560	Fifteen feet below, you see the crowd.
3530560	3539560	About twenty or so fancily clad individuals, each partaking in some sort of vice, be it drinking, smoking, snorting, or all of the above.
3539560	3547560	The crowd is gathered in the middle of the room where there are recliners and couches, papasans and pallets of blankets and pillows.
3547560	3552560	They lounge about and look up at the spectacle hanging above them in the middle of the room.
3552560	3555560	Hanging above the middle of the room is another cage.
3555560	3558560	It is made entirely of plexiglass.
3558560	3562560	Inside, there are two teenagers viciously wrestling.
3562560	3566560	One of them gets the upper hand and moves on top of their opponent.
3566560	3569560	This kid starts beating the absolute shit out of the other.
3569560	3572560	Both hands wailing directly into their face.
3572560	3578560	Blood is spraying down onto the crowd below and they fucking love it.
3578560	3587560	You notice that the floor of the fighting cage has little holes everywhere to allow anything to drip down onto the spectators.
3587560	3600560	I check in my underwear and see if my gun is still there, my tiny gun.
3600560	3604560	It's always there, baby.
3617560	3642560	How am I the only one trying to pull over?
3642560	3653560	How can you have enough drowning out all the noise?
3653560	3657560	There's no light at all.
3657560	3662560	No light at all.
3662560	3666560	No light at all.
