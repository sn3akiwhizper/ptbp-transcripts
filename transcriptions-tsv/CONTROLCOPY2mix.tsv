0	6280	This is yet another introduction to the show known as PTBP.
6280	10680	The good numbers follow, 694.2.
10680	16960	I'm Wolf the dog, the dog father, the dog mother, the dog puppy.
16960	19560	Many more nicknames follow.
19560	27000	I'm glad you can be here with us today, whatever today is, whenever today is.
27000	33320	And speaking of today, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Dean in the UK.
33320	35000	Dean writes,
35000	36760	Hello Mr. Wolf.
36760	39080	What's the time, Mr. Wolf?
39080	42600	It's time for more sickly sweet dumps to dive in.
42600	45400	Anyway, enough about my weekend.
45400	49760	I just wanted to give a big shout out to the fine fellas from Contention
49760	53440	doing their absolute best to keep us safe and sane.
53440	61440	You, yes you too, Mr. Wolf, have brought such joy, delight, and revulsion into my life.
61440	63440	And I couldn't be happier.
63440	69040	Just a shout out to my wife, Ellen, for trusting in me and listening to the show.
69040	71680	Two avid listeners from the UK.
71680	73360	Much love, y'all.
73360	77040	Signed, Dean, a fool.
77040	81360	Well, hello Dean, if that is your real name.
81360	87680	I'm glad you forced our show upon your spouse, Ellen, if that is her real name.
87680	94960	And do us all a favor and keep converting more and more people to be disciples of the wolf, the dog.
94960	98240	If you want to write up something for your dog mother to howl,
98240	103200	please submit your memorandum as a five-star review on Apple Podcasts.
103200	107680	And I'll read it here on 694.2 PTBP.
107680	113120	Ocean City, New Jersey's sloppiest and creamiest radio station.
113120	115200	Would you like that, dear listener?
115200	117680	Either way, I got some news for you.
117680	119840	It's time for the news.
119840	124560	In the early morning of March 22nd, Daniel M. White,
124560	130240	an active Delta Green agent and the former partner of Arvon Chilton,
130240	135760	received a phone call at 4.55 AM from an unknown number.
135760	141200	Neighbors in his apartment complex reported they heard shouting, then weeping,
141200	147520	and finally watched as Arvon Chilton chased Daniel White from the building.
147520	154000	White was found by a jogger three hours later on a trail behind the apartments.
154000	159520	He had been stabbed 25 times and his eyes had been meticulously cut out.
159520	162160	Neither of his eyes had been located.
162160	166160	The McCarty case and the White case was soon connected.
166160	171920	Arvon Chilton is still at large and he is still dangerous.
171920	175920	I've got to make a quick correction here as I drop this next track.
175920	185120	Last time, I said Brian Bolger, bowl like a bowl of slop and grr like an upset dog.
185120	188640	But I have since realized his name is Brian Bolger,
189280	194960	bowl like load one up and grr like the prefix to cough.
194960	198400	So go ahead, load a bowl and jerk off.
198400	202320	It's Brian Bolger with Bad in a Good Way.
218640	224880	And the shell shock of this pit stop frees my mind.
224880	233040	I'll be alright, I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.
233040	240480	I'll be alright, I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.
240480	248720	Alexander Duchene looks at Agent Sparrow.
248720	251760	He is 79 years of age.
251760	258320	He is clothed in old often mended clothing and a pork pie hat.
259280	266320	And he has a long winding scar up the right half of his face.
266320	273360	It's clear that he drinks due to the large nose with burst capillaries,
273360	279920	just filling this big, almost like pulsating thing on the tip of his nose.
279920	283680	And he moves slowly, seemingly with great pain,
283680	286800	as he kind of like pops his head around the side and is like,
289760	293440	Arvin said that it would be fitting.
293440	297840	And as he says that, a massive thunderclap hits
297840	300800	and rain starts to begin pouring down outside
300800	303280	and you can see it drizzling through the window.
303280	306160	Can I do an intelligence check about what As You Like It's about?
306160	306800	Sure, yeah.
308480	310960	I hope you pass before he does, well...
314000	316400	I pass with an 84 on an 85.
317920	319680	Shit, amazing.
319680	326400	Before anybody clarifies what it is, Agent Sparrow, Sparrow Agnew,
329360	330960	Agent Sparrow wants to ask,
330960	332240	and have you read it?
332240	333520	Did you find it to be fitting?
336320	337680	I haven't had time.
337680	342720	I just, I haven't had any time.
342720	344160	Do you know what he found?
344960	345840	Did he clarify?
345840	347280	Why do you think he found it fitting?
347280	348000	I don't know.
348640	352160	People who are into that kind of thing, you know, they're nerds.
353040	356400	And I'm not really much of a reader.
357120	360640	Elwood kind of perks up at the idea of nerd, nerdom.
361360	363120	I am.
363120	364400	I've read it.
364400	365200	I've read them all.
365200	365840	All?
365840	366720	All of Shakespeare.
366720	367840	So what's it about?
367840	373200	Well, it boils down to a bunch of people were pretending to be other people.
373200	373760	Yeah.
373760	374720	That does sound fitting.
374720	379440	People pretending to be people.
380160	381040	That's the gist of it.
381040	381200	Yeah.
382320	383840	That's how it works.
383840	386400	Agent Sparrow, your phone starts ringing.
388880	392240	It is the Ocean City Police Department.
392240	392720	Uh, yeah.
392720	398560	Hey, uh, Agent Sparrow, Detective Quinlan is actually back from lunch and she's interested
398560	399360	in talking to you guys.
399360	401600	She's the Newark police on the case.
401600	402080	All right.
402080	403760	Please tell her we'll be there soon.
403760	404560	Thank you.
405040	411600	Do you have any other questions for an old man before you go out?
411600	412000	Really?
412000	413920	I must insist.
414800	416800	Arvin is innocent.
416800	418480	How long did Arvin live here with you?
418480	419200	Five years.
419200	421360	Did he have a key to your apartment?
421360	422080	Yes.
422080	422720	Yes.
422720	426160	Maybe we should look around to see if he hid anything in here.
426160	428960	If he hid anything in here?
428960	434080	And he looks around at the place and he's like, no, I don't think Arvin would have
434800	436800	hid anything in my apartment.
436800	438080	It's always a possibility.
438080	441040	So if you don't mind, my associates are going to start looking around.
441040	446000	Um, while they do that, would you tell me the significance of these baseballs?
446000	447120	Oh, uh, yes.
447120	449440	I'm a big fan.
449440	450480	Who's your favorite team?
450480	451360	Yankees.
451360	452240	Where do they play?
452240	453280	The New York.
453280	454240	The new one.
454240	454720	That's right.
456960	458880	Did you play baseball as a child?
458880	459520	Who didn't?
460880	461600	Did you?
461600	461840	Yes.
462800	463280	All right.
463280	463840	Were you good?
465440	470480	Hey, you look at this like five foot seven, 210 pound man.
470480	472800	And he's just like, no.
478080	481920	I was a bit of a ball magnet crowd, the plate and hope they hit me.
481920	484560	Cause I wasn't much of a contact hitter.
485600	486960	I don't know much about sports.
486960	492160	I find that they take away from value funds that could be applied to youth academics.
492240	494400	He rolls his eyes at Elwood.
497120	502160	I think Elwood would kind of agree with this.
502160	506640	He's like wanting some sort of, you know, camaraderie there.
506640	507280	Not getting it.
508320	508640	Okay.
508640	514640	Well, you guys should go on out and, um, you know, take, take your call, talk to whoever
514640	519360	you want to, but keep in mind, you should be looking for someone who is not Chilton.
519360	521280	There's a, there's been a change in the voice.
521280	522880	Do we clock that or is that Zach?
523520	524800	He will human.
524800	525300	Okay.
529520	531760	That's a 100.
531760	535120	Oh yeah.
536080	537680	There's clearly something wrong.
539600	542160	There's clearly something wrong with this old man.
544640	547360	You're like convinced now with a fail.
547360	550560	Could I ask him, do you have something in your throat?
551280	554720	Yeah, yeah.
554720	557760	It's been allergies, spring allergies.
557760	558640	They come in.
559280	560400	It makes me talk weird.
560400	560800	I know.
560800	561280	I'm sorry.
562960	568400	That's seasonally appropriate, but no, this is what I always sound like in spring.
570240	574400	I can hear glimpses of your, the voice we heard you with before peek through.
574400	576320	It sounds like it's kind of come over you.
576320	577360	It's up here.
577360	578320	It's it's still here.
578320	581360	This is when I'm like really trying to hold back a cough.
581360	587920	And then down here is more so when I feel more comfortable, but I'm holding in a cough.
587920	594000	If I accidentally cough, I might have an accident if I'm being honest.
594000	597120	And I just don't like wearing them.
597120	597920	The diapers.
599920	602480	You're saying you suffer from incontinence, sir?
602480	603040	Yeah.
603040	604640	The bandages smell.
605200	607040	Do we see bandages on him?
607040	608960	No, he's well covered up though.
608960	613280	He, uh, he's wearing like a long sleeved shirt and pants.
613280	618880	And if I did like a medicine roll, do you think I could determine maybe what caused his scar?
619680	621040	Yeah, go ahead and roll medicine.
621680	623440	36 on a 60.
623440	623760	Okay.
623760	629760	Uh, yeah, it seems to have come from you think maybe some piece of metal.
629760	631920	How'd you get that scar, Mr. Duchesne?
631920	634480	How did I get these, this scar?
637600	639440	Uh, a horse.
639440	640400	A horse.
640400	641520	I fell off a horse.
641520	642320	Of course.
642320	642880	On two.
642880	643440	I fell.
643440	650560	And as I was falling, I got, I got kind of, you know, that, that horse kind of BDSM stuff
650560	651200	that they wear.
654160	654660	Yeah.
655200	656960	I think it's called Tack.
656960	657600	Tack, yeah.
657600	657840	Yeah.
657840	664800	Uh, there is a slice of metal, uh, you know, kind of shanked off the side and it got me
664800	666080	as I fell off.
666080	666960	Can I humid that?
666960	667460	Yeah.
670160	670960	One.
670960	671680	Oh yeah.
671680	673040	This is a lie.
673040	675040	Why are you lying to me, Mr. Duchesne?
675040	676800	His face gets super serious.
677760	680480	As you look into his eyes, he looks past you.
681360	682000	Who are you?
682560	683200	Who are you?
685280	686800	Why are you in my house?
686800	687920	Kevin gets scared.
687920	689920	Special agent Clarissa Sparrow.
691280	694640	And he's like kind of shuddering and hiding from you a little bit.
694640	695440	And he's like, get out.
696160	697200	Get out of my house.
698320	698960	Get out.
698960	700800	You invited us in Mr. Duchesne.
700800	701520	Okay.
701520	703680	I'm just not comfortable right now.
703680	704800	Please leave.
704800	705840	Please leave.
705840	706880	Now you meant that.
706880	707380	Yeah.
708800	709600	20.
709600	710100	Pass.
710720	712080	He's fucking with you.
712080	714240	You can drop the act, Mr. Duchesne.
714240	715520	What, what, what act?
716080	716640	This act.
716640	719760	Something about my line of questioning has made you uncomfortable.
719760	721760	And then you lied to her about the scar.
721760	723440	And I kind of make eyes at Kevin.
723440	724400	He starts weeping.
724400	727280	Kevin puts his hand on Duchesne's shoulder.
728000	730880	Not like to hurt him, but like it is shoulders.
730880	737040	Like it covers his hands kind of like around the back of his neck and on his shoulders.
740800	742960	My memory is so good.
743760	744800	Stop crying.
744800	745200	It is.
745200	746080	Mr. Duchesne.
746080	747920	My memory is just so shy.
747920	750800	I want to tell you that I don't know.
751520	752560	I don't know.
753440	755840	Not to just keep going at him at that.
755840	756340	Yeah.
757680	758180	12.
758640	760560	He is telling the truth.
760560	764720	He does not remember how he got this scar.
767200	769280	Mr. Duchesne, you have some problems with your memory.
774960	777680	Please have, have an olive.
777680	784800	She sees that he's like got his eyes clenched with tears and she kind of like motions to
784800	786720	plop one in her mouth and just throws it behind her back.
789920	790240	All right.
790240	792480	I accept your hospitality, Mr. Duchesne.
792480	793680	Thank you very much for that.
794640	795840	Have a good day.
795840	796960	Thank you for your spread.
797680	798480	Have a good day.
799840	802960	And you guys head back to the Ocean City Police Department.
802960	805840	Can I ask real fast when, when he passed his medicine,
805840	809280	could he maybe have gotten like a timeline on how old the scar is?
809280	810320	Yeah, that's a good question.
810320	811440	That is a good question.
815280	820400	Probably that scar happened when he was still growing.
820400	821120	Okay, cool.
821120	823600	So definitely childhood or early childhood.
823600	824240	Okay.
824240	824480	All right.
824480	826000	Yeah, I think we're.
826000	827120	So back at the PD.
827120	828400	Going back to the police department.
828400	830400	We've got to meet the Newark Police Department.
830400	831440	Well, she was detective, right?
831440	833920	Detective Mara Quinlan.
833920	835520	And she's PD, not.
835520	836320	She is PD.
836320	836560	Yeah.
836560	843280	And when you guys arrive, the woman at the front desk points you off to a separate hallway
843280	848800	where Quinlan is set up in a smaller room than the FBI.
848800	853680	The FBI guy was set up in this big conference room with an entire conference table,
853680	855040	and he's sitting at it by himself.
855680	858320	And Mara Quinlan is in a closet.
858320	861280	This is not her department, her police department.
861360	864720	No, she's from Newark, but she's been brought in because
864720	867040	part of the case took place in her jurisdiction.
867040	868880	So there's some cross lines.
869520	875120	When you open up this small closet, you see an immaculately dressed police officer.
875120	877840	Her hair is done very, very neatly.
878560	880960	Her makeup is done very neatly.
880960	883120	Her nails are done very neatly.
883120	887600	She's just a very well put together person and professionally addresses you
887600	888720	when you enter the room.
888800	893040	She says, Hello, Mara Quinlan, detective, Newark PD.
893040	895680	Nice to meet the FBI on this case.
895680	899920	Before they can say anything or like extend a mannae's hand.
899920	903040	Sparrow's very quickly like, Pleasure to meet you, Detective Quinlan.
903040	904000	Pleasure's on my agent.
904000	905120	Agent Clarissa Sparrow.
905120	906160	These are my associates.
906160	906640	Sparrow.
906640	907440	Agent Boyd.
907440	908160	Hi, Kevin.
909440	910560	Agent Kevin.
910560	911680	Elwood just nods.
911680	914640	Okay, I learned that you guys already spoke to Garza.
914640	915280	Is that right?
915280	915840	Yeah.
915840	917120	The stinky fat guy.
917920	918420	That's her.
919360	920240	She like laughs.
921520	922720	Clarissa elbows you hard.
923760	929120	She laughs and she's like, Yeah, you know, he seems like a nice guy.
929120	932640	I don't think he's on the right path with this case, by the way.
932640	936320	Like his whole idea that it's a kidnapping thing.
936320	937520	I'm not for that.
937520	940960	I think that this is a crime of passion clearly committed by Chilton.
941680	946240	Eileen McCarty is the body who died in her own home.
946240	948400	Her husband is the body that died in his own home.
949040	953840	We don't really have much of a budding of heads between me and...
953840	957760	She rolls her eyes real big and says, Uncle Jimmy.
957760	959280	You know, it'll be fine.
959280	960480	He's a good guy.
960480	963760	I think that he's got a good head on his shoulders.
963760	964960	I just disagree with him.
964960	969360	How does the gas station attendant figure into your crime of passion idea?
969360	975440	These are not murders committed by a person who has all of their faculties about them.
976240	977440	You've seen the crime scene photos.
977440	983040	I mean, the medical examiner even said quote and she reaches through some papers and grabs
983040	984480	one and pulls up.
984480	987920	I'll be damned if I know what's going on.
987920	990080	There's just there's anomalies all over the place.
990080	992000	In this case, it's wild.
992000	997200	In my experience, all anomalies and mysteries can be solved with rational, sensible answers.
998000	998960	It could be magic.
1000160	1002160	I slap you.
1006240	1011200	He just kind of like, if you speak out of turn one more time on my task force.
1011200	1012320	Or you'll do what?
1012320	1015360	She looks at Elwood with her eyes like contain him.
1015360	1022160	And then Elwood just puts a hand on like has to reach really high up to put a hand on Kevin's
1022160	1026320	shoulder and he just does a light double squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
1027440	1030000	Mara Quinlan has had her back turned this entire time.
1030000	1034240	When she saw the awkwardness happening, she immediately turned around and started fiddling
1034240	1035680	with files on this desk.
1035680	1039520	I mean, it seems like magic though, right?
1039520	1043040	I mean, three witnesses the day after her time of death.
1043040	1048960	I fully believe that that body is Eileen McCarty, but you know, three witnesses the day after
1048960	1050800	time of death is strange for sure.
1050800	1052880	Do you have any information about those witnesses?
1052880	1057120	All I have is that there's three witnesses the day after time of death and the medical
1057120	1063760	examiner also said it looks like the eyes were cut out with great care, which is odd.
1063760	1065520	Three witnesses the day after the death.
1066240	1066880	Yes.
1066880	1071040	So this is in addition to the witnesses who saw her on the day of the gas station crimes.
1071040	1071440	Yeah.
1071440	1072160	Yeah, that's right.
1072160	1072720	Yeah.
1072720	1074080	They saw her in New York.
1074080	1075920	The day after they saw her in New York.
1075920	1078320	The day after her death, they saw her in New York.
1078320	1080800	And then the next day was that the gas station.
1080800	1084400	Yeah, she was seen at the gas station where that murder, that horrible, horrible murder
1084400	1085280	took place.
1085280	1086800	What do you think about that footage?
1087280	1089040	She shudders.
1089840	1095840	One of her hands begins to like grip the desk and her knuckles turn white.
1096880	1097440	I don't know.
1098160	1103040	Well, if it, if it helps at all in my role as a profiler criminal psychologist, you learn
1103040	1105680	a lot about how regular people act too.
1105680	1109920	Sometimes they just shut down with the fear and they can't, they can't think of doing
1109920	1110640	the right thing.
1110640	1111200	Oh yeah.
1111200	1113760	She's just nodding her head and eating it up.
1113760	1114160	Yeah.
1114160	1114720	Yeah.
1114720	1114960	Yeah.
1114960	1115680	Of course.
1115680	1117680	That's why we do the job we do.
1117680	1122800	I like to think that I would have done something, but I, I understand wanting to not get involved.
1122800	1124080	You signed up to do something.
1124080	1124640	Exactly.
1124640	1127520	That's, that's what your service to this community is.
1127520	1130640	And my service is kind of at an end for you guys here.
1130640	1132640	I've given you everything I have.
1132640	1134400	If you have any questions for me, sure.
1134400	1138000	But I do have these super high res crime scene photos.
1138000	1140880	I know you probably saw uncle Jimmy.
1140880	1144800	All of our copies of those are, well, disgusting.
1144800	1145200	Yeah.
1145200	1145520	Yeah.
1145520	1149120	So I I've, I've got some on, on a thumb drive here if you want them.
1149120	1149920	Thank you very much.
1149920	1150800	I take the phone drive.
1150800	1151120	Yeah.
1151120	1157680	And maybe even after he handled Kevin dropping the magic like line, she like takes it, looks
1157680	1160000	over at Elwood and then tosses it to him.
1160000	1162080	Uh, Elwood catches it out of the air.
1162080	1163280	It sticks to his hand.
1164640	1168720	She instantly, she's like, no, now they're just covered in mayonnaise in another way.
1172480	1173520	Holler if you need anything.
1173520	1174480	Here's my card.
1174480	1175040	All right.
1175040	1177120	Thank you for your cooperation detective.
1177120	1178160	We'll be in touch.
1178160	1179040	Have a great day guys.
1179040	1180400	And you as well.
1180400	1182560	Hey, have you guys eaten since you've been out here?
1183280	1185760	Yeah, we had some charcuterie.
1185760	1187280	I had a bunch of olives.
1187280	1189280	Elwood made me spit it out.
1189280	1190560	Oh, I huh.
1190560	1192560	Well, you know, you just keep, you have a good day now.
1192560	1192800	Okay.
1192800	1192960	Yeah.
1192960	1194000	I regret asking.
1194560	1195760	They didn't taste good.
1195760	1196240	Okay.
1196240	1197280	Why do you care?
1197280	1200400	It's just, I had really good lunch, so I was going to suggest the place.
1200400	1201040	Where did you go?
1201600	1202880	Ocean city cafe.
1202880	1203760	It's really good.
1203760	1206720	It's just literally like around the corner from here.
1206720	1207120	Pretty good.
1207120	1208320	So if you need a bite to eat.
1208320	1209840	Is it by the dripping scoop?
1210480	1213520	Yeah, it's literally two doors down from the dripping scoop.
1213520	1213760	Okay.
1214560	1216080	I assume that was ice cream.
1216080	1217360	I want ice cream.
1217360	1218880	Oh no, that's not ice cream.
1221440	1222400	Hey Zach, what is it?
1227040	1229040	Where should we go almighty sparrow?
1229040	1234160	You guys all say as you're looking out, uh, kind of standing at the double doors of this
1234160	1237680	police station, looking out at the torrential downpour of rain.
1237680	1240560	Now coming down here in ocean city, New Jersey.
1240560	1242960	I get an umbrella out and hold it above Elwood.
1245680	1247360	There's no acknowledgement from Elwood.
1247360	1248240	It's just expected.
1248240	1248480	Yeah.
1249040	1251200	What was the name of the restaurant you told us to go to?
1251200	1256000	Ocean city cafe, a real place in ocean city, New Jersey.
1256000	1259200	That is like catty corner from the police station.
1259200	1261040	I only, I only had olives.
1261040	1262080	I will remind you.
1262080	1264160	And I could use something else.
1264160	1266640	I threw up my food and spit it out.
1266640	1271600	I didn't need any of this food, but I pretended to eat an olive, which I just feel rotten about.
1271600	1273760	Let's go where the lady told us to go.
1273760	1275600	Yeah, let's stop by the ocean city cafe.
1277440	1278400	Oh, that looks good.
1278400	1278800	Right?
1278800	1279120	Yeah.
1279120	1283040	So I pulled up a picture of the ocean city cafe from Google street view.
1283040	1284320	It's like an old house.
1284320	1284720	It does.
1284720	1287280	It looks like an old house, like an old three-story house.
1287280	1293680	And there's a nice green awning on the outside that says ocean city cafe, breakfast, lunch,
1293680	1300560	dinner, and there's some nice patio tables, like four or five tables outside with umbrellas.
1301200	1304960	No one's sitting outside cause it's fucking coming down cats and dogs.
1304960	1310640	And you guys rush in out of the rain into the ocean city cafe, which is a
1311600	1316480	bustling little cafe here at about 1 32 o'clock PM.
1316480	1318400	Hey, my name's Leah.
1318400	1319360	I'll nope.
1320160	1320560	Hello.
1320560	1321440	My name's Leah.
1321440	1322960	I'll be out in just a moment to help you.
1322960	1324880	You can find anywhere to sit that you would like.
1324880	1326480	Well, what happened with your voice just there?
1329040	1330240	I decided to change it.
1330240	1331840	Oh, are you like an actor?
1331840	1335040	No, it's just, I studied journalism at the university.
1335040	1340320	And so I was just, it's just, sometimes I like to put myself into other people's shoes for
1340320	1340880	just a moment.
1340880	1344240	Maybe, but her name tag says Leah Maloy.
1344240	1349600	She's 20 female, curly, brown hair and long limbs.
1349600	1358560	Shout out to crane song from Washington, DC, another $10 or up patron on patrion.com slash
1358560	1364880	pretending pod and crane song is actually one of our $50 a month first church of contention
1364880	1366400	youth group members.
1367040	1372080	And so, uh, I, she's, uh, she's played in a couple of games that I've run now, a couple
1372080	1376160	of Delta green games, uh, that I home brewed and, uh, an excellent player.
1376160	1380880	So thank you crane song for Leah Maloy, who will sit you guys down.
1380880	1381280	Okay.
1381280	1382560	Hunts, what'll it be?
1382560	1387920	Coffee, water, black coffee, a water toast, no butter toast, no butter.
1387920	1390000	Uh, Elwood's going to order for Kevin.
1390000	1394160	We'll take, uh, two chocolate milks, put some ice in them.
1394160	1395040	Put some ice in those.
1395760	1399040	We like it when it waters down, she shudders.
1401600	1407280	Kevin's looking at a menu in front of him and I want the munchy platter and the Jersey
1407280	1407780	burger.
1410240	1411920	Oh, you already know what you want to eat.
1411920	1412400	Okay, good.
1412400	1417520	The munchy platter has chicken tenders, onion rings, French fries, mozzarella sticks, and
1417520	1419040	Buffalo wings.
1419040	1419520	Wow.
1419520	1420080	Yeah.
1420080	1421040	Make that, make that too.
1421040	1421760	I don't need the burger.
1421760	1424000	I'll just take the platter.
1424000	1424400	Okay.
1424400	1425920	Platter and the munchy.
1425920	1428240	And did you want anything to eat on?
1428240	1428560	Yes.
1428560	1429440	Butter, no toast.
1429440	1430000	That's right.
1430000	1430640	So sorry.
1430640	1437440	Uh, and she, uh, started writing down, she started writing the notes after she took the
1437440	1438640	toast, no butter order.
1438640	1443280	So she does write down butter, no toast, and then walks away and then immediately turns
1443280	1448880	on her heels and it's like butter, no toast, no butter.
1448880	1454960	And, uh, as an embarrassed server might do turns and, uh, wanting that good tip later
1454960	1456400	is just like, no, no, no, my bad.
1456400	1457520	And goes to the back.
1458960	1463200	You're so fucked there because you can bring out both things separately, but you still
1463200	1466000	brought out one thing you were not supposed to bring.
1468560	1473120	She's just in the back staring at the sheet where she wrote down butter, no toast, and
1473120	1474880	is just like, did I mean to do this?
1474880	1475380	I do.
1476960	1484480	But you know, uh, she is a lover of facts and therefore she comes back to the table
1484480	1489920	a few minutes later with a coffee and two chocolate milks filled with the brim with
1489920	1491120	ice cubes.
1491120	1494080	Now I just wanted to do one more check on that butter, no toast.
1494080	1496000	Was that butter, no toast or toast, no butter?
1496000	1496960	What do you think?
1496960	1499680	That's a, that's a very good, that's a very good point, ma'am.
1499680	1501040	Sorry to bother you.
1501040	1502480	And she walks back.
1502560	1504160	Still not a hundred percent.
1505760	1507760	She's definitely bringing you butter.
1510160	1514000	Any, uh, any conversation happening over the, uh, coffee and chocolate milks?
1514000	1520080	I think at least now agent Sparrow is like really deep in these crime scene photos.
1520080	1521760	Oh, wait, we get, we didn't get copies of those.
1521760	1524160	We got the, well, we didn't talk about, can I have a computer?
1524160	1526080	Yeah, fuck yeah, you can have a computer.
1526080	1527760	2016 baby.
1527760	1528480	I'm pulling it up.
1528480	1532000	I plugged in the, uh, the stick and we're looking at the high res images.
1532000	1533600	Roll luck for me real quick.
1533600	1537600	50 50 shots, 47.
1537600	1544720	You plug it in correctly the first time that USB slides in there.
1545600	1550080	Agent Sparrow, like her eyebrow raises that you're like, you really can get in and out of places.
1552320	1557040	Actually, as you guys, it says here, you have to roll sanity again because these are high
1557040	1559680	res crime scene photos.
1559760	1563360	And so it says obscured by mayonnaise dance.
1563360	1564000	That's right.
1564000	1568800	So quote, there is nothing to be seen here except sand loss.
1570800	1572080	We fell into your trap.
1572080	1572320	Yeah.
1572960	1575040	Not when you, not when you roll sick twelves.
1575040	1577120	Oh, nice pass 32.
1577120	1577760	I fail.
1577760	1578160	Okay.
1578160	1582080	So, uh, you are going to lose three sanity.
1583200	1585440	Elwood Boyd loses three sanity.
1585440	1586800	Are you okay, boss?
1586800	1591680	He's probably shaking a little bit and he's now turned the computer screen away from himself
1591680	1595200	so that you guys can see it, but he doesn't want it in his field of view at all.
1595200	1600400	Agent Sparrow kind of like takes it from him and starts sort of very familiarly flipping
1600400	1602080	through this file like system.
1602080	1605680	She's been given reports like this before and she's just like tabbing through and she's
1605680	1606720	like, yeah, okay.
1607600	1608880	No eyes, no eyes.
1608880	1610800	Carefully removed very carefully.
1610800	1613120	So do you think the book is a clue?
1613280	1617920	Shane seems to think that I want the listener to know that every single time Joe goes into
1617920	1623040	character, he holds his wrists limp and then one over the other.
1623040	1623920	We'll post a picture.
1623920	1624160	Yeah.
1625360	1626560	Like he goes a little Igor.
1627360	1627600	Yeah.
1629280	1629520	Yeah.
1629520	1631680	That's the sort of the picture of my brain.
1631680	1638880	It's Igor, the creature, which is actually what you just lost sanity to was some Igor.
1643200	1647120	Hey, I like that one.
1648240	1649360	That's both electronic.
1652320	1656000	And the thing we just said in all the blood.
1656000	1656560	You're right.
1656560	1657840	That's why it was a joke, Joe.
1660560	1665040	Sometimes you would just let it sit with the gore, but you worked in that E.
1665040	1666080	The E was important.
1666480	1674880	It's could I give you a forensics or medicine or even alertness or search role on these
1674880	1679360	pictures to determine what just to see if I can glean anything more from them?
1679360	1682720	Yeah, go ahead and give me a forensics.
1682720	1683760	What about a medicine?
1683760	1684320	Oh, okay.
1688640	1689120	Whichever.
1689680	1690880	It'll get you something different.
1690880	1691600	I suppose.
1691600	1692240	Okay.
1692240	1693920	46 on a 60 medicine.
1693920	1694320	Okay.
1694320	1698480	So with a 46 on a 60 medicine, you're really diving in.
1698480	1704480	And I will say, even though the great Dennis Detwiller wrote, there's nothing to be seen
1704480	1708880	here except sand loss, especially because you passed that sanity check.
1708880	1709920	Oh yeah, you did just say that.
1709920	1710960	You can dive in.
1710960	1711920	Yeah, I did.
1711920	1721040	But you dive in and you can very clearly pull up a picture of Eileen and it's definitely
1721040	1721680	Eileen.
1722000	1725040	You can match it up enough to where like the corpse.
1725040	1733760	Yeah, anyone who thinks that this is not Eileen is really grasping at straws to make a case
1733760	1734400	that they want.
1734400	1738480	Now I think I know what's going on as Thomas, but Agent Sparrow doesn't.
1738480	1742320	Agent Sparrow definitely would because she doesn't know the scenario is called control
1742320	1749280	copy or that this podcast is called pretending to be people and like that's part.
1749520	1753280	Yeah, you're right.
1753280	1754400	She doesn't know those things.
1754400	1754960	She does.
1754960	1760000	She does like take a note of the fact that this is certainly Eileen's corpse unless she
1760000	1762160	has a twin with both her eyes.
1762880	1764640	These witnesses were sorely mistaken.
1764640	1769280	What about a magic that makes you look like her?
1769280	1770640	Oh, I'm glad you brought that up.
1770640	1777280	Hey, now I know you've been on a couple of nights at the opera before with Elwood.
1777280	1780320	Yeah, yeah.
1780320	1782880	Y'all are just friendlies right now, right?
1782880	1783520	Is that what they call you?
1783520	1785760	We're friends with each other for a long time.
1787840	1788480	Right, right.
1788480	1790160	Elwood, you're friendlies?
1790720	1792880	No, we're full-fledged these days.
1792880	1794320	We've done a couple of these now.
1794320	1799200	All right, well, that concerns me because this one doesn't seem to know you can't be
1799200	1800640	talking to civilians.
1800640	1805360	Well, you know, it's a police officer, but you can't be talking to the uninitiated about
1805360	1807600	the supernatural and the otherworldly.
1808480	1809280	You're right, bud.
1809280	1813280	That is probably magic, but we can't be saying that to detectives from Newark.
1813280	1813920	Do you know what I mean?
1815920	1817280	Can you guys roll alertness for me?
1819280	1821360	I'm gonna roll intelligence to see if I know what he means.
1823120	1827440	Okay, I passed alertness and I passed my intelligence check.
1828000	1834160	Leah Molloy failed her stealth roll and she is trying to eavesdrop.
1834160	1836320	I also passed my alertness.
1836320	1839200	So you guys were able to have this conversation covertly.
1839200	1845040	As you notice, she is literally trying to bust the tables closest to you as she kind
1845040	1847680	of gets a hint that you're talking secrets.
1847680	1854640	Yeah, so agent Sparrow tilts the laptop away from her from a view in towards the booth.
1854640	1856480	And she says, let me go grab your food.
1856480	1862960	And she comes back with both things that Kevin ordered, one of which also goes to Elwood
1863520	1868480	and then she sets down a plate very, very awkwardly.
1868480	1871760	She slowly sits down a plate of butter.
1872320	1875520	Agent Sparrow is already just like looking back in her notes.
1875520	1880720	And you can tell she's really deep and lot like she got she's on a trail and she just
1880720	1885120	kind of absentmindedly like spoons butter into her mouth.
1885120	1890720	And like it looks she makes an unpleasant face, but doesn't, you know, spit it out or
1891600	1893520	really clock that that's what she's just done.
1893520	1897600	The other two you see Leah Molloy is like, oh, nailed it.
1900000	1900560	Nailed it.
1900560	1905520	And then she says, did you guys hear about the new vandalism in town?
1905520	1905920	What?
1905920	1909600	Yeah, it's this weird like pentagram ish kind of thing.
1909600	1914320	It's this dark brown paint that someone's using to make these tags.
1914320	1916960	It looks like it's so scary.
1916960	1918080	Can you guys handle this?
1918080	1919280	It's super scary.
1919280	1920240	Dark brown.
1920240	1920800	Yeah, yeah.
1921680	1923280	Agent Sparrow's like stomach sinks.
1923280	1926880	Kevin is like intently listening, but he hands her his two empty plates.
1930240	1936400	And she kind of like holds him on her forearm like a server might as she's like, yeah, this
1936400	1936720	thing.
1936720	1942640	It's kind of pentagram ish, but it looks like a bearskin rug.
1942640	1943440	You know what I mean?
1943440	1948080	Like the head, then the paws, then the feet, you know, that would make kind of a star pattern
1948160	1950480	like a pentagram, but it's not a bear.
1951040	1952000	It's like a person.
1952560	1955440	It's like the picture of it's like a person who's like splayed out.
1956160	1958240	It's like a person skin rug.
1958240	1960960	Yeah, but that's it's just that it's art all over.
1960960	1964000	It's crazy looking and dark brown paint.
1964000	1964320	Yeah.
1964320	1966080	Is it like the rotruvian man?
1966080	1967040	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1967040	1971440	Like Leonardo DiCaprio, but but skinned, right?
1971440	1971920	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1973600	1976080	Like skinned and pinned by the stiff.
1976080	1981920	Oh, actually, so that jogs something in Agent Sparrow's mind and she's like, I'm hungry
1981920	1982480	then I thought.
1982480	1983440	And she points to the menu.
1983440	1985600	She says, I will take the skinned and pinned.
1990320	1996240	You said is have you seen that that symbol that's been other there many places?
1996240	2002080	I hear like everything that goes on in Ocean City because I don't know if you could tell
2002080	2002880	earlier.
2002880	2003680	I think you could tell.
2003680	2005200	I was trying to listen to you guys too.
2006480	2010800	But I just I love it trying to get the scoop trying to get the scoop.
2010800	2015360	You know, I dropped out, but I'm going to get that big break and I'm going to write
2015360	2018400	the story that puts my name on the map.
2018400	2018880	Do you know?
2019440	2023280	Well, Miss Malloy, if you want to make a difference in this world, I suggest getting your law
2023280	2026320	degree and going into some kind of criminal enforcement.
2026320	2028320	That's the only way I really see to make a difference.
2028320	2033280	But because that's what we did do, it's our job to scoop around, figure that out.
2033280	2034880	That's not that's not yours.
2035520	2036880	And do you have any pie?
2036880	2037120	Yeah.
2037120	2038640	Why don't you butt out and get us some pie?
2039600	2041840	And one spin and pinned extra crispy.
2041840	2045440	Completely turned off by this situation.
2045440	2047920	She's not going to try to make any more chitchat with you guys.
2047920	2052480	She's just going to bring you the food and the pie and then you can head out as you guys
2052480	2053920	are finishing up the pie.
2054640	2055440	Blueberry.
2058960	2063680	Miss Malloy, do you know the location of any of those recent graffitis?
2063680	2066320	Yeah, there's one literally right around the corner.
2066320	2068560	It's on the Ocean City Cafe.
2068560	2069360	Thank you very much.
2070080	2074320	Agent Sparrow leaves a not great, but sensible and not insulting tip.
2074880	2075360	What is that?
2075360	2076560	What percentage is that?
2076560	2077840	It's probably like 17.
2077840	2082800	As he's scooting out of the booth, Elwood grabs a fork near him and he finishes off
2082800	2084480	whatever is left of the pad of butter.
2087920	2088560	Do I see that?
2089920	2090240	Sure.
2093920	2098320	Yeah, Elwood, for the rest of the game, is going to have like grease marks around his
2098320	2102400	mouth from doubling down this plate and then butter also.
2102400	2103360	Jesus.
2103360	2104400	It's horrible.
2106080	2109520	When we get around to the graffiti, Kevin's going to start doing some push-ups.
2111200	2112400	Okay, I'm going to go pee real quick.
2112400	2124000	Until I had an alien abortion.
2124000	2125520	Alien abortion.
2125520	2126960	Alien abortion.
2126960	2128480	Alien abortion.
2128480	2129680	Alien abortion.
2129680	2131680	Get this beast out of my belly.
2133840	2138400	Kevin Gelato begins doing push-ups.
2143280	2145920	How does Kevin do push-ups?
2145920	2147360	Look at Clarissa.
2147360	2148880	It's how he keeps in shape.
2148880	2154240	Yeah, and she's tapped you and she's like, I think it's good that he's distracted for
2154240	2154560	a minute.
2155280	2156320	Can we talk for a second?
2157440	2158000	Sure.
2158000	2159920	So like, you help him out?
2159920	2162000	What's the nature of your...
2162000	2164000	I mean, we help each other out, surely.
2165120	2168080	I guess you could say he's my bodyguard.
2168640	2170320	That's kind of the way I like to think of him.
2170320	2171120	Your bodyguard.
2171120	2172160	Yeah, I mean, look at me.
2172160	2176000	I wouldn't do anything in a fight and I do run my mouth from time to time and I feel
2176000	2178320	like I should have some muscle there.
2178320	2180320	He's always been by my side.
2180960	2182080	I keep him around.
2182080	2182400	All right.
2183200	2183760	Yeah.
2183760	2184880	Would you say you're friends?
2186080	2186720	He would.
2186720	2187220	Yeah.
2189120	2195440	So yeah, Clarissa just allows that to be added to like how sad the world is.
2195440	2199520	She's just like, can't.
2199520	2200240	All right.
2200240	2202320	Can't think about that necessarily right now.
2202320	2204880	Yeah, you look down at the ground to get away from that thought.
2204880	2208400	Well, I look down at the ground and see him doing the pushups and then I look back up
2208400	2211600	and he's like, there's one more thing I wanted to say.
2212320	2215120	You know, when that waitress mentioned the dark brown paint.
2215680	2217760	I saw your eyes kind of sunk a little.
2218640	2219280	Well, I just...
2220320	2222720	Do you know what gets dark brown when it dries?
2223520	2228560	He's just seen the crime scene photos and it sparks in his mind a little bit.
2228560	2230320	Oh, oh.
2231360	2233520	Yeah, that's blood.
2233520	2235680	I'm going to go take a look at this graffiti.
2235680	2238960	Could you keep him here doing pushups?
2238960	2241680	Do you think you could handle the side of that if you knew what it was?
2242400	2244720	I think Elwood would think that he could handle it.
2244720	2248240	Like he clocked that guy in the back of the head in my pre-story.
2248240	2250640	Yeah, like I don't think he's immune to violence.
2251600	2253920	Oh, I thought he jacked him off so well that he passed out.
2256320	2257760	You said he whacked him real good.
2257760	2259920	He whacked him so good, dude.
2259920	2261440	He said he's in his boxers on the floor.
2262080	2264320	Whacked him so good that he's down for five hours.
2264320	2265120	Western style.
2265120	2269680	If it was a big crusty cum stain on the wall, he would handle it, but it's blood.
2269680	2270180	I don't know.
2270800	2271520	That's what I'm thinking.
2271520	2274800	If it's a big crusty cum stain on the wall, he could handle it.
2274800	2276000	This is blood.
2276880	2281440	Oh, I think I just spoke.
2281440	2282640	He didn't whack him.
2282640	2283040	Whack him.
2283680	2284400	He whacked him.
2284400	2286080	And at this time you hear Kevin go,
2286720	2288080	and a punch.
2288080	2289920	And then he just gets up and walks over.
2292800	2293920	And a bunch.
2300960	2305360	Kevin, can you stomach the side of blood?
2305360	2307040	I made people bleed.
2307040	2307600	He has.
2307600	2308320	Yeah, he has.
2309200	2310400	On and off the field.
2310960	2313440	She takes a note of that as well and doesn't say anything.
2313440	2318080	She's like, all right, let's go investigate this graffiti.
2318080	2318320	Yeah.
2318320	2322480	Also, I don't even know what kind of EQ I'm going to have to use on Luke's voice for this
2323040	2326400	group of episodes to get that voice.
2327040	2330000	It's not that you're speaking quietly.
2330000	2334640	It's just that I fully had to parse it for a second in my language center.
2335600	2337920	It was like a Spanish person listening to Portuguese.
2339920	2341920	Like, oh no, we can make each other self understood,
2341920	2344480	but I'm not going to be fluently communicating with you.
2347760	2351760	So you guys turned the corner, just right around the corner of this restaurant.
2351760	2354560	And basically, if you were driving on the street,
2354560	2357360	you would be able to see this vandalism.
2357360	2360880	This, we can say it's blood, probably.
2360880	2362080	Blood graffiti.
2362080	2363120	Probably blood graffiti.
2363920	2368400	Justin hits some sweet, like, string rises here.
2368400	2368880	Oh yeah.
2368880	2376080	It's as Agent Sparrow, like, shakily walks up to the wall and does a medicine roll to examine it.
2376080	2376580	Yeah.
2380320	2380960	69.
2383760	2384260	Nice.
2384960	2385460	Whoa.
2386880	2387380	Okay.
2389200	2390000	69.
2390880	2391380	Hmm.
2392160	2393200	I know the blood type.
2393200	2393600	Who's blood this is.
2393600	2394800	He knows who's blood it is.
2395680	2398480	I was trying to think of a way that I could tell you who's blood it is.
2400720	2402320	They wrote the name above here.
2402320	2402820	Right.
2403360	2404240	69.
2404240	2406800	Kevin just ordered dinner for two.
2406800	2407920	And you guys are...
2407920	2409360	Is there any cool meaning I might be...
2409360	2411120	Like, I was trying to see if it was blood,
2411120	2414880	but do I grasp maybe the significance of this picture?
2414880	2415040	Yeah.
2415040	2419840	With the 69, I will tell you that that is an occult symbol.
2420480	2424720	It is related to the Testament of New Flesh.
2425360	2427840	Is that, like, even something I might have heard of before?
2427840	2428720	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2428720	2430800	That's why you recognize it, is you're like,
2430800	2436000	shit, this is the Testament of New Flesh,
2436000	2441440	which is this, like, old idea that there were these chants
2442080	2446640	that people could learn in this language called Aklo,
2446640	2451120	which is a pre-human language that people talk about,
2451120	2454320	like, it's this thing, like, within the walls of Delta Green,
2454320	2456720	you know, people might be talking about Aklo,
2456720	2461360	some very, like, estranged professors who are not well respected
2461360	2463520	at their specific universities, you know.
2463520	2467280	These are the kind of people who talk about Testament of the New Flesh.
2467920	2471840	It's cult worship of some sort of unknown deity.
2471840	2472480	Yeah, yeah.
2473280	2478880	I knew a man, he was almost like a father to me,
2480400	2485600	but he died on my first mission with this organization,
2486400	2487920	but he spoke of things like this.
2488880	2492720	He was interested in this group, he called it the Testament of New Flesh,
2494080	2495920	and this is one of, it was crude,
2495920	2498480	he didn't have a good drawing of it, but he showed me this symbol.
2499600	2501120	Agent Sparrow, your phone starts ringing.
2501920	2502480	Unknown number.
2503280	2505520	No, it doesn't say unknown, it has numbers there.
2505520	2506480	It's 2016.
2506480	2507360	It's 2016.
2508160	2510480	I already don't want to answer phone calls that I get
2510480	2512400	when I don't know the number at this point in time,
2512400	2516240	but this is my work phone, so I do.
2516240	2517120	Yeah, hello.
2520160	2523760	Agent, Agent, Agent, uh, Sparrow, right?
2523760	2524960	Mr. DeChase.
2525760	2529520	DeShane, yes, I, I am so scared.
2530400	2534960	I just got, I got a voicemail, I got a voicemail from Chilton.
2536000	2537680	It says I'm next, he's gonna kill me.
2538320	2539280	He's gonna kill me.
2539920	2541600	You hold on tight, we'll be right there.
2541600	2542480	Thank you.
2542480	2543360	He hangs up.
2543360	2546640	Elwood, you call 911, you tell them to get RAT to his address,
2546640	2548800	and then I directly call the detective.
2548800	2550640	Elwood, Elwood's gonna pop in real quick.
2552640	2553360	What's going on?
2553360	2555680	Mr. DeChase just got a message.
2555680	2557120	He says it's from Chilton.
2557120	2559120	He says Chilton threatened him next.
2559120	2560800	We gotta get there immediately,
2560800	2562880	and I think we need all the help we can get.
2564240	2567760	I worry that we should keep this in-house for the time being.
2568800	2571920	What if he shows up and does our kind of thing?
2571920	2574640	But what if he shows up and the cops are already there and he doesn't?
2574640	2575840	We could save this man's life.
2576400	2579680	From my experience, that's not exactly what we're hired to do.
2580560	2586400	We're supposed to keep the unnatural threat from civilian eyes.
2587920	2590560	Well, she's gonna try to persuade you.
2591440	2595120	We know this unnatural threat is after his civilian eyes.
2596640	2597920	They dig out the eyeballs.
2601360	2602800	You can give me a big disadvantage on that.
2602800	2606080	That's not a good argument, but it's a funny argument.
2606080	2608000	How do you combat a persuade?
2608640	2611520	Humant, or you can role persuade yourself.
2612160	2613360	They're the same!
2615120	2615600	Forty.
2615600	2616160	Fifty.
2616160	2616560	Fifty!
2619280	2620240	Big ol' fail.
2620240	2621040	She fails too.
2621040	2621840	Who failed higher?
2621840	2622800	Mine's a ninety-eight.
2622800	2623920	Oh, Jesus.
2623920	2624800	Mine's an eighty-two.
2624800	2625360	That'll do it.
2625360	2627120	So you're not convinced, but you're...
2627120	2627600	Play ball.
2627600	2631120	You don't feel confident enough maybe to say no to her in this situation.
2631120	2631760	I like that.
2631760	2634080	There's a pause, and you were looking at each other,
2634080	2635760	and she can just see you don't buy it.
2636400	2640320	I have my reasons to believe that he could be important to this case,
2640320	2643680	and you don't buy that either, but you can tell that she's gonna go try to save him.
2643680	2644240	Sure.
2644240	2647520	Elwood does reluctantly call local PD.
2647520	2648000	Yeah.
2648000	2649520	You were calling the detective?
2649520	2653280	I was gonna call the detective, but I was hoping you could call actual dispatch
2653280	2656240	and just start the process of getting, you know, cop cars.
2656240	2656720	Sure.
2656720	2659760	While I'm gonna specifically call some of these, like, people.
2659760	2660800	The players.
2660800	2661040	Yeah.
2661040	2661280	Yeah.
2662000	2664160	Elwood is doing that on the phone.
2664800	2667040	He says, hey, it's Agent Boyd,
2667040	2671680	and we have reason to believe that the landlord Duchesne life is in jeopardy
2671680	2672240	or something like that.
2672240	2672880	Absolutely.
2672880	2677120	And when Agent Sparrow calls in to the department and talks to Quinlan,
2677120	2679520	she can talk to Garza as well either way.
2679520	2680640	I don't talk to Garza.
2680640	2682000	Oh, you don't like Uncle Jimmy?
2683920	2685600	I do not care for Agent Garza.
2685600	2686240	Yeah.
2686240	2689680	Quinlan will tell you that when you tell her what happened,
2689680	2691680	she says, let me check the phone records.
2691680	2692400	They got a ping.
2692400	2697680	And yeah, they got a ping that Arvin Chilton's phone called Alexander Duchesne's phone.
2697680	2698400	Cool.
2698400	2702960	Detective Quinlan, I need you to gather anyone you have here with you from Newark,
2703600	2705200	any of your associates.
2705200	2706640	We haven't met Gambeson yet.
2706640	2707920	Please get them involved.
2707920	2709760	You can tell Agent Garza or not.
2709760	2711440	Gambeson is out still.
2711440	2714240	He must have taken a long lunch or got caught up doing something,
2714240	2715920	but he'll be back later.
2715920	2718400	Can they see where that phone call was from?
2718400	2719120	Gia, look at it.
2719120	2719840	Ping it?
2719840	2720340	Yeah.
2720800	2722240	Put it in a triangle.
2722320	2724720	It was in Ocean City, we can say.
2724720	2728320	You said put it in a triangle.
2728320	2729680	You mean triangulated, yeah.
2730240	2732080	Have they been able to triangulate the signal?
2732080	2733120	Like on Netflix.
2734080	2736480	Put it in a triangle is a pretty good way to describe it.
2736480	2738640	Put it in a triangle.
2738640	2740880	The call's coming from inside the town.
2745200	2746160	We've got to hurry.
2746160	2749040	When you arrive in our jaguar.
2749040	2750160	And you're fucked up.
2750160	2750640	What?
2750640	2751920	Our jaguar.
2751920	2752880	In our jaguar.
2757440	2758080	What is that?
2758080	2762320	Solve Delta Green and kill scary monsters.
2762320	2765280	And get there in the back of our jaguar.
2766320	2766640	Cool.
2766640	2767760	You guys all know the thing.
2767760	2768400	Dragula?
2769760	2770160	You would know.
2770160	2770720	I think you would know.
2770720	2772080	You don't know that song?
2772080	2778400	Burn through the riches and burn with the riches and burn in the back of my dragula.
2779520	2780640	No, it was fun though.
2780640	2781360	I like it.
2781360	2781760	Wow.
2781760	2782880	We'll play it for you later.
2782880	2783200	Okay.
2783200	2785760	It's like one of the opening parts of the matrix.
2785760	2787440	They're all dancing in a club to that song.
2787440	2788320	Oh, for real?
2788320	2788640	Really?
2788640	2790480	I haven't seen the matrix in a long ass time.
2790480	2791120	Yep.
2791120	2793120	That's such a, that's so bizarre.
2795440	2799120	I kind of, I mean like that's, I could see like a goth dance club.
2799120	2800000	That's kind of what it is.
2800000	2800800	Like the late nineties.
2800800	2803520	It's like industrial enough that that song can hit the masses.
2803520	2805440	Oh, it's where he goes down the rabbit hole.
2805440	2805680	Yeah.
2805680	2806640	Follows the white rat.
2806640	2807920	Yeah, he follows the rabbit.
2807920	2808400	Gotcha.
2808400	2810560	We arrive there in our jaguar.
2810560	2811280	That's right.
2811280	2814720	And there are four squad cars already on the scene.
2815360	2820640	There are some police officers in uniform standing around their cars, just kind of like
2820640	2821840	talking to each other.
2821840	2827120	You see that the door is open and there are a couple officers already speaking to Mr.
2827120	2832480	Duchesne who waves his hands at the three of you when he sees you arrive.
2832480	2834800	Kevin waves back at him in Kevin's mind.
2834800	2839680	He's like trying to put on the FBI character and he gets out of the car and goes up.
2839680	2841360	So what's going on boys?
2841360	2843200	Oh, you're a big fella, aren't you?
2843200	2843440	Hey.
2845840	2846320	Uh-huh.
2847360	2848400	Big guy.
2848400	2849120	Uh-huh.
2849120	2850960	Big guy in the FBI.
2850960	2855200	The look on Kevin's face goes to a little bit of confusion and almost like, are they
2855200	2856000	making fun of me?
2856800	2859840	Yeah, for sure we are.
2861840	2862560	What?
2862560	2864080	I'm an FBI.
2864080	2865280	Are you walking into the house?
2865280	2868640	Yeah, she doesn't see this because she is like beelining for the door.
2868640	2872400	I think Elwood would be kind of shuffling behind her and when he gets toward Kevin,
2872400	2874160	he just kind of pulls him along with him.
2874160	2878000	Yeah, Kevin like picks up the front of one of the cruisers and kind of shoves it.
2879440	2883200	Yeah, just like and like gives them a dirty look.
2883200	2883760	Oh my God.
2883760	2885920	They're both like freaking out and you walk away.
2885920	2889760	But when you turn back and look, one of them's on the other one's shoulders and they're
2889760	2891520	like, where'd that guy?
2893120	2893760	Oh man.
2895440	2895680	Wow.
2896720	2897200	Hey Kev.
2899440	2900080	These Kev.
2901120	2902800	These cops are bastards for sure.
2904640	2904960	All right.
2904960	2906640	And so you guys go...
2907840	2911360	What about, you know, humble public servants like John Lee Pettymore?
2912960	2914640	Who never did a thing wrong in his life.
2914640	2916720	Never did a thing wrong.
2916720	2919120	Diligent public employees like Keith Vigna.
2919120	2923520	You can go honestly wave off these officers who are currently talking to Duchenne because
2923520	2926480	he clearly wants to talk to you as opposed to them.
2926480	2930160	I need to speak with Mr. Duchenne alone for a moment, but can you brief me on what you
2930160	2932160	found here in the time you've been on the scene?
2932160	2934400	He leans in real close.
2935120	2940560	I've been holding my nose the whole time without holding it with my hand because he
2940560	2942160	spells really bad.
2942160	2945280	Like this apartment spells horrible and so does he.
2945280	2948160	Did you determine anything about the nature of the threat?
2948160	2949840	Oh, I listened to the voicemail.
2949840	2950880	Do you want to hear it?
2950880	2951600	Yes, please.
2951600	2956880	Okay, so he'll pull up Duchenne's phone and plays you a voicemail and you just hear...
2963600	2966000	Clearly in the voice of Arvin Chilton.
2966000	2967120	We just established it.
2977120	2979600	Arvin Chilton and I'm possessed by dark mysteries.
2981600	2986080	I love Shakespeare.
2990560	2994480	Yeah, that's a really unsettling voicemail to hear.
2996480	2997440	I'm not changing it.
2997440	2998480	That is the voicemail.
2998480	3000160	Oh wow, I'm gonna kill you.
3001440	3004240	So chipper and casual about that threat.
3004240	3006160	I would be alarmed too, Mr. Duchenne.
3006160	3006660	I just...
3010000	3013200	He wouldn't do it, I don't think, but that's him.
3013920	3015120	That's his voice.
3015120	3017040	That's his voice and they sang it.
3017040	3020080	It sounds like, yeah, he said point blank that he was going to do it.
3020080	3021440	I think he's gonna do it.
3021440	3022560	Did you make him mad?
3023600	3025200	I didn't do anything.
3025200	3026000	But what did you...
3026000	3027520	You gotta do something.
3027520	3028240	I didn't.
3028240	3031120	Were you maybe supposed to get his book back to him a little sooner than you did?
3033200	3035360	Yes, maybe.
3036480	3037360	I don't know.
3037360	3038480	I doubt that's likely.
3038480	3042480	You said he was giving it to you one to two days before he disappeared?
3042480	3043040	That's right.
3043040	3045920	That would be a very short amount of time to expect a book back.
3045920	3048000	Also, I don't think it's worth murder.
3048720	3049220	Do you?
3050560	3053600	As a criminal profiler, I have to tell you that
3053600	3058800	what murderers consider worth murder is not what you and I would expect.
3058800	3061920	Damn dude, that's intense, Agent Sparrow.
3061920	3065760	Your life is in danger, but these officers are going to be here with you all night.
3065760	3068240	How come you let it go for your voicemail?
3068240	3069840	I couldn't hear my phone.
3069840	3072560	It was on vibrate and I couldn't hear it.
3072560	3076720	So for the first time, Agent Sparrow is gonna call Agent Garza.
3076720	3077120	Okay.
3077120	3081280	And basically she's just gonna relay that if you can coordinate with the local cops
3081280	3085520	to give him round-the-clock protection for at least the next few days while we're in town.
3085520	3086800	Okay, sounds good.
3086800	3088400	Did you try calling him back?
3088400	3089120	Well, you...
3089120	3090000	Hey, big guy.
3092160	3093520	Well, you stay with me.
3093520	3095120	These guys, they got guns.
3095120	3096240	They got whatever.
3096240	3097200	They're cops, you know.
3097200	3100480	They have guns, but you, you're a big guy.
3100480	3102480	I think you could definitely protect me.
3102480	3103680	Kevin looks at Elwood.
3103680	3105600	Elwood kind of steps between them.
3105600	3106800	No, he's mine.
3106800	3108240	I know what he says.
3108240	3110880	Agent Sparrow's on the phone, but that gets an eyebrow raise from her.
3110880	3111380	Uh-huh.
3111920	3113760	Okay, well, could both of you stay?
3113760	3117600	You could both stay upstairs or you could stay in here anywhere, please.
3117600	3119440	I just feel so scared.
3119440	3120720	What time is it?
3120720	3122000	It's getting later now.
3122000	3124240	It's probably five, five thirty.
3124240	3128000	I think internally Elwood also would think, but it's not the worst idea.
3128000	3130720	It'd be like staking out the place all night.
3130720	3131600	Yeah, so she does.
3131600	3132880	She pulls you aside.
3132880	3135280	She's like, yeah, that was, that was my thinking as well.
3135280	3138800	And we've seen what whatever's out there can do to people.
3138800	3142160	It wouldn't be such a bad idea to have the big fella around.
3142160	3146000	Now, let's let him get some sleep, the big fella.
3146000	3147040	You take first watch.
3147840	3149760	I'm going to start reading as you like it.
3151520	3153760	Actually, I mean, I guess the cops are keeping watch.
3153760	3155600	We've still got the uniform police here.
3155600	3159520	Why don't we encourage Kevin to take a little nap, sleep off those burgers.
3160080	3162080	I've got his copy of as you like it.
3162080	3166640	I've just sent you a link to a free digital open source copy of as you like it.
3166640	3168720	Why don't you read along and we can see if we can.
3169840	3174160	You seem intelligent, even though you are very shifty and quite mean to your friend.
3174880	3177440	I'll read it again if you think I need to, but I have read it.
3178080	3180000	It's, it's a thrilling tale.
3180000	3183360	Since you're already so familiar with the text, I would just, I'd love it.
3183360	3188160	If you read it again with me and I will be looking for maybe some overarching themes,
3188160	3192640	but perhaps with your familiarity with the text, you could pick out some details that
3192640	3194640	that might might've missed that might be relevant.
3194640	3197600	As they're having this conversation, I'm over with Chilton still.
3198560	3199520	You're with Chilton?
3200400	3200880	He's here.
3201680	3202080	He's here.
3205040	3207200	I am with Duchenne.
3207200	3207600	We did it.
3209600	3210880	The Eastern Seaboard is safe.
3210880	3216160	Uh, I'm as they're talking, as they're talking, I'm over with Duchenne.
3216160	3216560	Yeah.
3216560	3218880	Did you call him back and ask him why?
3218880	3224480	No, I, as soon as I heard it, I, I call, he points at agent Sparrow.
3224480	3226880	He's like, I called agent Sparrow.
3226880	3232560	Call him back and see where he is and ask him why.
3232560	3235840	Agent Sparrow looks at you with like genuine shock on our eyes.
3236960	3238800	Yeah, that is a pretty good, yeah.
3239440	3242560	We'd like to, everybody, everybody quiet down.
3242560	3243440	Everybody quiet down.
3244080	3248480	Mr. Duchenne, please, please redial that number.
3250560	3252240	His finger shakes.
3254400	3256320	Zach's rolling to see if his finger falls off.
3256320	3260720	Wobbling as it goes to punch in the number.
3261920	3263840	It's a rotary of Arvin Chilton.
3263840	3267600	He's going to roll for each number dial because he might miss click at any moment.
3267600	3268100	Yep.
3268720	3270240	First number is good.
3271280	3271920	Second number.
3271920	3273120	Oh, got it wrong.
3274560	3280080	Until Zach rolls heads seven times in a row, he's going to be getting one number wrong.
3280080	3283600	And we just got to sit here and play that out because sometimes that's what we're playing.
3286560	3287360	Let me try again.
3289920	3290640	Please.
3290640	3296400	And he finally just goes to calls recent and then clicks on the name Arvin Chilton.
3297600	3304160	And agent Sparrow, Kevin Gelato, Elwood Boyd, as well as these two police officers
3304160	3307600	and Alexander Duchenne all here.
3315520	3318480	Coming from the upstairs apartment.
3319280	3321600	Oh, it's coming from the who's.
3324240	3324800	Oh no.
3327600	3343040	Kevin looks at Elwood and looks at Clarissa and is like, not sure why they have these
3343040	3346720	expressions on their face, but he matches their expression quickly.
3357600	3367520	And when my ears pop and the shell shock of this pit stop frees my mind, I'll be all
3367520	3368320	right.
3368320	3374400	I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.
3374400	3376480	I'll be all right.
3376480	3381760	I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.
3387600	3405760	Doesn't it always seem like the parts that made us laugh now make us cry.
3406960	3414160	Doesn't it always seem like the villain pulling the strings is a regular guy.
3415120	3419440	You and me have gone bad in a good way.
3419440	3420640	I promise.
3423360	3428800	Kerosene wipes clean what we couldn't bear to tarnish.
3431360	3433360	I'll be all right.
3433360	3438880	I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.
3439440	3441520	I'll be all right.
3441520	3456880	I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.
3471520	3486880	There's a conundrum in the wisdom of my spirit.
3486880	3494880	Whitewashed hymns in the deadliest sins push me to my limit.
3495760	3504240	When you deconstruct, you're shit out of luck for a minute.
3504240	3510240	After the last spin, you can break it all down to rebuild it.
3524880	3532880	You and me have gone bad in a good way.
3532880	3534880	I promise.
3534880	3540880	You and me have gone bad in a good way.
3540880	3542880	I promise.
3542880	3546880	I'll be all right.
3546880	3552880	I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.
3552880	3554880	I'll be all right.
3554880	3562880	I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.
