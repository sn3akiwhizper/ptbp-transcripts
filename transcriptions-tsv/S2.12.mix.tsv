0	4800	Salutations and vibrations, my faithful listenership.
4800	9520	It's your large and in-charge DJ Wolf the Dog.
9520	14040	I am sending vibrations of various lengths to you
14040	18760	live from 694.2 PTBP.
18760	21480	The only radio station.
21480	23960	It's the only one, folks.
23960	26800	Do not attempt to listen to any others.
26800	28480	They do not exist.
28480	30280	Hands off that dial.
30280	35280	Do not turn your ears away from Wolf or else.
35760	38320	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Jared
38320	41440	in Houston, Texas, who tweeted about the show
41440	44000	and tagged at Pretending Pod.
44000	47520	And now he gets to send this wolfy memorandum
47520	52520	to Oliver in Mishawaka, Indiana.
52640	56420	Jared writes, to Oliver Chestnut,
56420	58820	you are my greatest and best friend.
58820	61460	We have shared laughter and love,
61460	64780	memories that will last until the stars are right,
64780	69780	and most importantly, comedy TTRPG podcasts.
70020	74060	The journey may be long and the old ones may be near,
74060	76820	but so long as I walk the path with you,
76820	79060	it will be a road worth taking.
79060	82500	Whether we are vampire cops datin' their partner,
82500	85940	archimites checkin' out the cold Corbett house,
86460	89380	or Delta Green agents vibin' on reverb,
89380	93460	I'm glad that it was us who took those journeys.
93460	96460	Well, technically you took those journeys.
96460	100940	I was busy playin' God and found it a game worthy of me.
100940	105940	May your smile shine and your hair always be anime colored.
106140	108100	Love, Jared.
108100	112620	PS, Fuck Mark Zuckerberg and Fuck Jack Dorsey.
112620	117620	PPS, love and energy to those pretending pod fellas,
117900	122740	and to the original phantom of truth, Wolf the dog.
122740	126460	Jared, thank you for this internet mail.
126460	129500	I appreciate all forms of mail.
129500	132780	The internet kind, those ones are good.
132780	135940	You mainly said a lot of things about Oliver,
135940	137420	and that's good stuff.
137420	141060	We love to see it, and I hope Oliver appreciates
141060	144220	all the weird stuff you made me say out loud.
144220	146660	But the it that I love to see
146660	150980	is you sayin' that good, good stuff about little old me.
150980	154740	Smiles and kisses to you, dear Jared.
154740	157620	If you wanna write up somethin' for your Wolf the howl,
157620	161060	tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram,
161060	163700	tag pretendin' to be people on Facebook,
163700	165460	or write up a five star review
165460	168060	on the podcast app of your choice.
168060	172340	Screenshot them aromatic and intimate words,
172340	176740	and pass it along to your vibratin' Wolf the dog.
176740	179260	But Wolf, how am I supposed to know
179260	183540	where to find the 34 bonus episodes on Patreon,
183540	186820	or the grace drippin' swag in the merch store,
186820	189900	or the rowdy conversations in the Discord,
189900	193180	or the comments from Luke in the subreddit,
193180	197140	or the songs from Wave's soundtrack on YouTube,
197140	200860	or the download for R.I. Peter's Cruisin'.
200860	204060	Now listen, you, and listen good.
204060	206140	Say it with me, everyone.
206140	209980	The links are in the show notes.
209980	213260	And now, it's time for two quick announcements
213260	216900	from my producer, who scrawled this on my mirror
216900	219860	and waited under the sink until I found it.
219860	223620	No spoilies, but this is the final episode
223620	227820	of the four part prequel art, The Death of a Salesman.
227820	230940	Pretending to be people will be back in two weeks,
230940	232860	on October 7th.
232860	235980	Bloodily pickin' back up where they left off,
235980	237980	in Grover's gorge.
237980	240260	And for those of you blessed listeners
240260	244860	who support us on Patreon and await new bonus episodes,
244860	249300	we will have two new episodes for you in the comin' weeks.
249300	253500	The first is a Luke run game with our dear bud Jake,
254340	257660	joinin' to play the one page RPG, Witness Me,
257660	260460	based on Mad Max Fury Road.
260460	264460	And the second is a Zac run game of subway runners,
264460	268540	a forged in the dark game where a rainbow haired gang
268540	271900	went to repair subway lines under the city.
271900	274860	Oh, and it's set in a cyberpunk future
274860	277660	where everyone is immortal.
277660	280460	Speaking of, they had so much fun with it
280540	284220	that Zac is runnin' part two of that subway runners game
284220	289220	live in the Dennison this comin' Tuesday at 7.37 p.m.
290500	292140	Central time.
292140	296020	All right, that's enough announcements.
296020	297900	Gimme the news.
298740	301540	Actually, the boys do a pretty decent recap
301540	303340	at the beginnin' of this one.
303340	308220	So for its final bow, put your hands and cheeks together
308260	310900	for R.I. Peter with Cruisin'.
310900	311740	Cruisin'.
340900	345900	My archetype, I know this isn't right,
357460	358780	but I'm a beefy boy.
361780	364940	It's somethin' very similar to that, but you know.
364940	366660	It's a beefcake.
366660	369580	Also, every time we do, beefcake, there we go.
369580	372780	Every time we do the 30 seconds of silence,
372780	375460	you know, in a horror movie where they're trying
375460	378700	not to breathe hard so that the killer doesn't find him,
378700	380260	that's exactly how I feel.
381780	385580	I saw that you put both hands over your mouth and nose.
385580	386420	You can breathe.
386420	387460	I was crying. Eyes wide.
387460	388300	I start crying.
388300	389380	Dude, you can breathe.
389380	391180	Just lean back from the microphone.
391180	393780	No one said hold your breath for 30 seconds.
393780	395980	It's hard to do.
395980	397980	Wait, let's see how old we can hold our breath.
397980	399820	I think you can hold your breath.
399820	402260	I'm not gonna try, but you guys get it.
402260	403100	Oh, right.
407180	408420	I didn't even start trying.
408420	409260	I'm not.
411380	413460	There's nothing better for a podcast.
413460	416420	Yeah, I think we're onto something.
416420	419980	Oh, Luke won, if he was ever playing.
419980	421020	You look like you won.
421020	423220	I was playing, but then I wasn't counting,
423220	425180	and I was like, I don't wanna do this.
426100	428060	I'm glad you didn't waste time counting
428060	430980	because I would have never accepted your count.
430980	433180	It was 69.
433180	434020	Oh, nice.
434020	436540	So, I know we literally just stopped recording
436540	440220	the last episode and we're recording the second episode now.
440220	441620	It's nine weeks later.
441620	442460	Sure.
442460	443980	So we know what's going on.
443980	446660	For the audience who may have skipped,
446660	448180	just forgot to listen to this episode,
448180	450740	and be like, what did happen in that last episode?
450740	452100	Yeah, in your own words,
452140	455260	I'm curious to hear what's happened so far.
455260	459220	Well, so far, you wanna recap of the whole pink-a-boo?
459220	460420	No, just where we're at.
461780	466500	Our doctor, Dr. Shark, got eaten by Quicksand and died.
466500	467700	Well, no, no, no.
467700	468620	Whose body do we have?
468620	469460	We have Dr. Shark's body.
469460	472660	No, you left Dr. Shark's body in the pool of water.
472660	473500	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
473500	474340	But we took it from the Quicksand.
474340	477380	We're weakened at Bernie's zine, Dr. Shark.
477380	478780	Yep, you did that for a while.
478780	481820	And then we replaced Dr. Shark with a...
482380	483420	With a doctor from the neckbeards.
483420	486580	That's right, whose captain died.
486580	488300	His captain did die, Captain Neckbeard.
488300	490920	Yeah, and you changed his name.
490920	491760	We did?
491760	492580	Yeah.
492580	493660	His name wasn't Captain Neckbeard,
493660	494500	or we changed the doctor's name.
494500	495940	No, no, no, the doctor, you changed his name.
495940	498140	You asked him what his name was, I think he told you,
498140	499800	and then he changed it.
499800	500640	To what, do you remember?
500640	502500	So you're more than welcome to change it again,
502500	503340	obviously.
503340	504180	Yay.
504180	508700	I think he talked like this.
508700	510140	Yeah, he was scared, for sure.
510180	512520	He was a bit scared, and he talked like this.
512520	514500	Once we put him on board, we started calling him
514500	517880	Dr. Pisspants, because he pissed his pants in fear.
517880	519300	Dr. Pisspants.
519300	520140	Dr. Pisspants.
520140	520960	All right.
520960	521800	I think that's what it was.
523080	526080	And then we got on our ship, right?
526080	527920	You headed back out to start the race.
527920	528740	Oh, we stole Neckbeard's ship.
528740	529580	You stole Neckbeard's ship.
529580	531640	I think we just told their crew, like,
531640	533380	hey, you're with us now, right?
533380	534460	And you sent the...
534460	536660	Jesus H., Jesus Christ, and...
536660	538500	Yeah, we sent one of your golden...
538500	539320	Mrs. Knife.
539520	540520	And Mrs. Knife.
540520	543560	We sent my Emperor Tamarin monkey, Jesus Christ,
543560	546800	along with Dr. Shark's parrot.
546800	547640	That's the one.
547640	548460	Mrs. Knife.
548460	549300	Uh-huh.
549300	550120	Mrs. Knife.
550120	550960	To go run the ship.
550960	553840	And the mother of Mitch to recite the all-important word.
553840	556760	Mrs. Diggory is on her way there to recite the ship.
556760	557720	And then who do we have?
557720	559240	We have our cool friend we made.
559240	560540	Zach, pause, pause, pause.
560540	561380	Yeah, what's up?
561380	564160	Are you writing fucking Harry Potter fan fiction
564160	565200	this whole season?
565200	567840	Like, is that what you call the Diggory,
567880	570720	so this can all kind of fit canon into your, like,
570720	573380	wait till you meet Umbridge.
575720	577540	I take her with that.
583860	584720	Nice.
584720	587040	Okay, Mitch is the guy that we have.
587040	587880	Yeah.
587880	591000	Yeah, Mitch is on the back of the ship alongside.
591000	595360	Oh, yeah, Edward Spitz, the cold-blooded butler.
595880	597720	He's not really a butler,
597720	599080	but he likes to think of himself like that.
599080	599920	Yeah.
599920	601640	That's my pulp Cthulhu occupation.
601640	602480	I love that.
604160	606520	And Joe, you're playing?
606520	608040	Waverly.
608040	608880	That's right.
608880	609960	They call me Wavy.
609960	611000	Wavy Adler.
611000	614940	Wavy Adler, and he kind of has taken the charge
614940	618080	of, like, steering the ship in what is looking
618080	621900	to be some sort of eldritch ritual race.
624500	625340	Yep.
626180	628500	And we have to, we're pouring oil?
628500	630180	No, we're pouring blood, baby.
630180	633660	We're pouring blood out of the back in a big circle.
633660	635120	Okay, yeah, that's right.
635120	636720	That was kind of the reveal at the very end.
636720	640740	My very single last note is that the barrel
640740	644020	started gushing blood, and Mitch quote-unquote begins.
651020	652780	And he continues to chant.
652820	654980	I got a solicitor today who was saying
654980	655820	that to me on the phone.
655820	657700	Yeah, I was just about to say that sounds exactly
657700	658540	like the phone call.
658540	660100	Making a call, Joe, yeah.
660100	660940	Wow.
662260	663720	Do you want to explain that?
663720	667000	I got a call, Zach was setting up,
667000	668620	and he told us all to take off our headphones,
668620	670180	and as he told us that, I got a phone call
670180	671860	from my internet service,
671860	673220	because I had just recently disconnected,
673220	674460	and they wanted to give me a survey.
674460	676940	But as soon as I answered the phone,
676940	678700	he played that sound.
679780	680620	So loud.
680620	682660	And he played so loud out of the headphones.
683500	686020	And I looked at Joe like eyes wide open.
686020	687900	It was disorienting for everyone,
687900	690540	because we thought my phone was making that noise.
690540	694300	I watched you three idiots grapple with that.
694300	695860	I kind of got it right away.
695860	696700	Yeah, that's right.
696700	697820	I played it, and I was still like,
697820	699560	what the fuck, Joe?
701300	703660	To be fair, I was not sitting on the couch
703660	705520	with your phone, and it was blasting super loud
705520	708300	out of my own headphones, so I might have had
708300	710220	some more context clues for it.
710220	712420	Yeah, I was right here, and I was watching it
713060	714540	come out of your phone, and I was like,
714540	716100	hang up, Joe, hang up.
716100	716940	Hang up.
719940	721740	Like, don't keep letting that play.
724180	727100	So you hear that echoing from the back of this ship.
727100	731380	As the race begins, the smoke in the center
731380	735700	of the island turned from dark to white,
735700	737860	and the race began.
737860	741560	As the race began, you noticed the closest ship
741560	745960	to the shore of the island, Fancy Pyromancy on the Damcy,
745960	749200	took off at a wild rate.
749200	752120	They rolled a critical success on their sailing,
752120	757120	and they literally shoot ahead, basically completing
757200	762120	one third of the entire circle around the island
762120	763760	in this first push.
763760	768760	Also, in the same round, they succeeded on taking out
769080	774080	one of the masts on the Swing Sing Brothers two mast ship.
774280	776440	Now, they were the ones with the best guns.
776440	779520	Fancy Pyromancy on the Damcy indeed are the ones
779520	781800	with the best guns, that is correct.
781800	783920	Where are the swing boys?
783920	788040	Next, closest to you would be the Swing Sing Brothers
788040	791160	from Fancy Pyromancy on the Damcy, who's the furthest away.
791160	793240	The Swing Sing Brothers are next up.
793240	797560	You saw one of their giant pillars of wood
797600	801680	that holds up the bedsheets that make ships go fast.
801680	803960	That whole shit fell into the water.
803960	806720	That is a fun fact, they do just use bedsheets.
806720	810880	I just assumed, I've never seen cloth so big besides that.
810880	812320	Yeah, hey.
814480	816960	They haven't invented parachutes yet, have they?
816960	818780	Big sailing ship is gonna tell you
818780	821480	that they're not just bedsheets, but buddy, they are.
822400	827400	The crew that you have sort of taken under your wing
827600	832480	and as your second ship in this race could not get moving.
832480	835960	And you notice that they actually messed up their cannons,
835960	839320	they fell over, their cannons are not operational
839320	841080	and they were not able to move forward.
841080	843240	The group next to you, the Port Deserters,
843240	846840	these are the Union Jack flag with the bottle
846840	850520	sewn into the middle of it, triple X across the bottle.
850560	852180	I would remind my fellow pirates
852180	855240	that they were seen drinking heavily before the race.
855240	858200	Yes, and you took advantage of that.
858200	863200	And I do believe that Alabaster Al Chernabog,
863560	865120	we talked about the other two characters,
865120	867080	but we didn't talk about Alabaster Al.
867080	869880	What is he like when he's running these guns
869880	874880	that you laid off to just lay absolute blows
876440	878760	to this massive ship of the Port Deserters?
878760	880960	You see that it doesn't all get through
880960	883440	their extremely sturdy, girthy ship,
883440	886440	but enough of it does because of you.
886440	888600	You know, the ship isn't the longest, but.
889600	892600	This might start out a little rough, but here we go.
892600	896160	The way that, oh, it's gonna start out real.
896160	898360	No, it's nice, it's nice.
898360	900640	The way that he likes to run the ship,
900640	903960	he's very excited the whole time that he's doing it.
903960	907520	He cannot wait to fire that next round
907520	909060	until they've won the game.
909060	914060	So he excitedly has told them to fire off the shots
915080	917840	and he got so excited he forgot to tell
917840	919720	the rest of the crew to start reloading
919720	922280	because he just went and started reloading them.
922280	923880	But they see, they're paying attention.
923880	925100	What does it sound like when,
925100	926920	and you lead by example clearly,
926920	929560	so what does it sound like as you lead by example
929560	931120	remembering in that moment,
931120	932600	oh shit, I have to tell the crew?
932600	933440	Oi!
934600	936440	They all immediately look over.
936440	938680	Well, that's the code word that we have set up
938680	939980	that means reload, just.
941720	943120	Oi! Oi!
943120	946760	And bombs away, you were able to knock a fair amount
946760	951000	of damage onto and off of that poor deserter's ship.
951000	954240	And off we go to the top of round two.
954240	957680	We're gonna start with Joe as the rope man
957680	960760	and the wheel man for this large ship,
960760	962840	the death of a salesman.
962840	964440	Death of a salesman.
964440	965600	Do you want me to roll?
965640	967280	I would love for you to roll.
967280	968680	Just doing my ship driving?
968680	971080	Yeah, we're all gonna, I'm gonna roll too.
971080	972000	What's a sail?
972000	973720	Like when they have a discount.
973720	974600	Oh my God.
974600	978160	So that's a fail, it's an 80 on a 70,
978160	980520	but I'm gonna use one of my three luck.
980520	983040	Ooh, very smart man.
983040	985780	It's only so smart because it only makes it an eight,
985780	988080	which isn't great if I'm in a competition,
988080	990240	but it's still a success either way.
990240	992640	Fantastic, so that is a success.
992640	995600	The port deserters actually rolled a critical fail
995600	998840	and yet they were able to use a bonus dice to avoid that,
998840	1001520	but they rolled a 98 instead of an 88,
1001520	1003960	which is still a failure.
1003960	1006680	The neckbeard ship finally takes off
1006680	1010120	into the waters ahead of itself
1010120	1012600	as the Swing Sing brothers do the same.
1012600	1015720	Up in the lead, you see far in the distance
1015720	1018560	away from your ship, Fancy Pyromancy on the Damned Sea,
1018560	1021880	once again succeeds and continues
1021880	1024140	towards the end of this circle.
1024140	1028400	They're almost out of your view at this point.
1028400	1029240	Yikes.
1029240	1030360	Are we not moving at all?
1030360	1032600	I can tell you cause it'll give you a good idea
1032600	1034020	of how fucked you are.
1034020	1038840	You have made it 20%, they have made it 50%.
1038840	1039680	Shit.
1039680	1040500	Wow.
1040500	1041340	Yeah.
1041340	1042220	But that's with like two crits in a row.
1042220	1043440	Crit and then a success,
1043440	1045740	but they started much closer to the shore than you,
1045740	1047520	so they're gonna be able to complete their circle
1047520	1048600	much sooner.
1048600	1050320	I thought the slowest ship was on the inside
1050320	1051480	and the fastest ship was on the outside.
1052040	1053200	The slowest ship is on the inside,
1053200	1054840	they just crit it and succeeded.
1054840	1056080	I don't think we need to worry about this
1056080	1056920	that much right now.
1056920	1058180	And so like distance wise,
1058180	1059800	you said we can barely see them.
1059800	1061240	Yeah, you can barely see them,
1061240	1063880	but just through the distance there,
1063880	1067800	you see that they absolutely wreck shop
1067800	1069880	on the Swing Sing brothers.
1069880	1070900	Oh shit.
1070900	1074280	Just, oh shit, move it till it's,
1074280	1076920	oh girl, light it up and let me see y'all.
1076920	1077760	Swing.
1077760	1079200	Ship swing.
1079200	1083920	And the Swing Sing brothers ship is moving forward
1083920	1086560	in space, obviously.
1086560	1087880	We're in space now?
1087880	1090160	Hell yeah, dude.
1090160	1092960	In between you and the Swing Sing brothers
1092960	1095960	is the neck beard ship.
1095960	1097080	And that's what they're all saying.
1097080	1100280	As the Swing Sing brothers ship moves forward,
1100280	1104360	you see it disappear behind neck beard ship.
1104360	1108640	And then when it passes through on the other side,
1108640	1111200	you see that it is basically emaciated.
1111200	1113360	It is the skeleton of a ship.
1113360	1117720	It has been absolutely ripped apart by cannons
1117720	1120640	and those wire things with the balls,
1120640	1121800	connecting with the wire,
1121800	1123640	just like taking out everyone.
1123640	1124480	Chain shot.
1124480	1125320	Benoit balls.
1125320	1127480	It's called chain shot.
1127480	1128760	Benoit balls, I'm pretty sure.
1128760	1129600	Also not to pile on,
1129600	1131760	but that's not what emaciated means.
1131760	1132600	Emaciated means.
1132600	1134160	Would be like very skinny.
1134160	1135000	Yeah, they're all really hungry.
1135000	1136060	Be hungry and starved.
1136060	1136900	Yeah.
1136900	1137720	That ship looks so hungry.
1137720	1141320	I would say this has been hacked to bits.
1141320	1144200	Yeah, like to the points where you can see its ribs.
1146440	1148440	Like a turkey on Thanksgiving.
1150440	1151640	I'm gonna stick with it.
1151640	1156640	This emaciated ship crawls across the ocean.
1159640	1163480	Ship Akimbo passed the other ship in the distance.
1163480	1164940	That was something I saw on the Discord.
1164940	1166480	You don't actually use Akimbo wrong.
1166480	1168400	People just didn't know how it could be used.
1168400	1169380	Fuck yeah.
1169380	1170760	Thanks for sticking up for me now.
1170760	1172080	Jesus.
1172080	1174840	Oh yeah, you mean where thousands of people will hear it
1174840	1177640	instead of like the two dozen on the spoilers chat?
1178760	1179900	The Sweeting Brothers.
1179900	1180740	They're dunzo beans.
1180740	1181560	They're dunzoed?
1181560	1183940	Absolutely dunzo beans.
1183940	1188100	And with that, we move on to the gunning phase
1188100	1189240	for Death of a Salesman.
1189240	1192240	You have one ship within your sights.
1192240	1193640	It is the Port Deserters.
1193640	1195460	The Port Deserters were the fast guys
1195460	1196660	that we were worried about.
1196660	1199300	And they failed their second check, yeah.
1199300	1200460	You are ahead of them.
1200460	1203220	Then yeah, we've reloaded.
1203220	1204060	We've reloaded.
1205380	1207660	And oi oi!
1209660	1210820	That means reload.
1210820	1212340	No, oi means reload.
1212340	1214180	Oi oi means fire.
1218260	1219100	Go ahead and roll.
1219100	1220340	A third of the crew is confused
1220340	1222300	and just start packing more rounds in.
1223140	1224660	Two round shot.
1224700	1225540	You're not a confederate.
1225540	1226380	You did that again.
1226380	1227200	That's a goner.
1227200	1228040	Oh, there it is.
1228040	1228880	That's a goner.
1228880	1229940	It felt like it went down in the catch.
1229940	1233180	It's a 42 on 80.
1233180	1234020	Yeah, that'll do it.
1234020	1235720	Go ahead and roll a D4 and a D8.
1237820	1240300	We've got a two on the D4.
1240300	1241400	A two and a five.
1241400	1242540	And a five on the D8.
1242540	1244700	Makes for seven points of damage.
1244700	1248220	Again, you do a little bit more damage this time
1248220	1250160	than you did last time to the Port Deserters.
1250160	1252500	And they have finally noticed.
1253420	1255620	Oh, okay.
1255620	1257820	You hit them hard enough on this one
1257820	1260180	to where some heads are actually popping up
1260180	1262480	on the top deck.
1262480	1263320	And they're looking about.
1263320	1264960	What if their heads were popping off?
1264960	1267900	Oh yeah, actually you see one guy in the back
1267900	1269600	whose head pops out just in time
1269600	1273100	as that last cannon ball just heads him off.
1273100	1275020	You fucking patriot.
1275020	1277100	He gets absolutely
1277100	1277940	patriotic.
1280140	1281020	That seems rad.
1281060	1282780	I had not seen that movie in years.
1282780	1285200	I forgot that fucking Mel Gibson is the head
1285200	1288700	of a family of benevolent slave owners.
1288700	1290060	Yeah.
1290060	1292140	I did not, yeah.
1292140	1294660	And it's like, it's weird.
1294660	1296260	It's patriotic as hell as well.
1296260	1297840	It is, it is, yeah.
1297840	1298860	It's very American.
1298860	1301080	It's just such a choice.
1301080	1302260	Could have easily.
1302260	1304220	Dude, that guy makes a lot of those, huh?
1304220	1306500	Been from Boston.
1306500	1307780	I watched that in third grade.
1307780	1308820	Didn't pick up on that.
1308820	1310360	Did pick up on the hatchet that goes
1310640	1311480	to the guy's skull.
1311480	1312320	That's stuck with me ever since.
1312320	1313520	Yeah, that part's rad.
1313520	1315480	The guy getting fucking his head blown off
1315480	1316320	by the cannon.
1316320	1317800	Not blown off, just like flick.
1317800	1322220	Yeah, as if God's, as if God's finger came down.
1322220	1327220	Luke, oh, Alabaster Alshernabog's cannon
1327680	1329920	flicks this man's head off.
1329920	1330760	And then.
1330760	1331600	Patriot style.
1331600	1334320	The, over the intercom of this.
1334320	1337300	His head is emancipated from his body.
1338300	1340540	Team Slayer.
1340540	1345180	Thomas, next to you, Mitch Diggory is continuing
1345180	1350180	with his Er-wah-doh-nyeh-nyeh.
1350940	1352700	I used to think, made out like his words
1352700	1355740	were complicated, but it's just a fucking Little John song.
1357980	1358820	What?
1358820	1359780	Thank you, Joe.
1359780	1361780	I thought you said Elton John.
1361780	1362620	And then he's like.
1362620	1363460	And I was.
1363460	1364660	You were like racking your brain.
1364660	1365980	I was trying so hard.
1365980	1368340	I'm like, it doesn't make any sense to me.
1370100	1370940	What?
1373860	1375700	Got the headlights on the.
1375700	1376540	What?
1378380	1379740	That's hard on the throat.
1381220	1383520	Yeah, so Edward just imagines it's like,
1383520	1385820	he's rapidly like thinking, what is the point of Mitch?
1385820	1386800	I could do this.
1388500	1390980	All them swinging bastards.
1390980	1392740	I got a ship all eat up.
1393760	1395340	It's emaciated.
1395980	1396820	Yeah.
1399380	1400700	Emaciated.
1400700	1402160	You're saying they're hungry?
1402160	1404680	No, all I'm trying to say is gone mostly.
1404680	1406780	Most of their ship is just gone.
1406780	1410140	Para-mancy on the damn sea, they show them all the shit.
1410140	1411720	There's none left.
1413500	1415540	None left was blenders anyway.
1415540	1416940	And then there were three.
1416940	1418700	They're out there dying in the water.
1418700	1422300	Look at the bastards drowning and feeding the sharks.
1423460	1425580	Boy, they're dunzo beans.
1426140	1427600	Reload, but fuck.
1429360	1432280	By dunzo beans, do you mean dunion rings?
1434980	1436820	It's exactly what I mean.
1436820	1438940	I thought so, because I made that playlist
1438940	1441700	after my last breakup and sent it to you.
1441700	1446700	In an attempt to be done with your ring around this island,
1447900	1452900	I need a roll for sailing from Sir Wavy Adler.
1453180	1454380	Can I use rope to help him?
1455380	1458340	You would not be able to fire if you use rope to help him.
1458340	1459180	I don't want to help him.
1459180	1460940	And what are sails?
1460940	1463860	I believe they are the fitted sheet specifically
1463860	1466420	so that it attaches easier to the mast,
1466420	1469100	which I learned in my head recently is the wood part.
1469100	1469940	Mask.
1471300	1472860	I got a seven.
1472860	1473700	You got a what?
1473700	1474520	Seven.
1474520	1475360	Oh, that is a success.
1475360	1477220	Yes, I believe that is a success.
1477220	1479140	I successfully did sailing.
1479140	1482020	You push even further than the port deserters
1482060	1485140	who, while lively, seem to be more concerned
1485140	1487060	about the damage you've done to their ship
1487060	1492000	than actually moving forward in any measurable way.
1492000	1495340	The neckbeards, however, do succeed and move forward.
1495340	1498220	They're actually about even with you now.
1498220	1501300	And you see that you are both catching up,
1501300	1503260	slowly but certainly surely,
1503260	1505380	to fancy pyromancy on the damn sea.
1505380	1507620	Attagah, way to go, boys.
1507620	1508660	We're catching on them.
1508660	1509500	But then.
1510340	1511180	Oh!
1512380	1516060	Through the side of the neckbeard ship,
1516060	1520340	you see a cannonball four times bigger
1520340	1524260	than you've seen on any ship you've been on
1524260	1528020	bust through your side of neckbeard ship.
1528020	1530860	So it's across from you in the water
1530860	1534420	and you just see that, and as it hits the water,
1534420	1536740	it splashes you.
1536740	1540500	They are desperately trying to patch the hole
1540500	1543420	as water is lapping up inside.
1543420	1545220	Can we see where that shot came from?
1545220	1546060	Was it the pyromancy?
1546060	1546900	It was the pyromancy, right.
1546900	1547780	Or did it come from the island?
1547780	1550340	You can certainly roll.
1550340	1551340	Can I do a spot hidden?
1551340	1553220	Yeah, we can call that spot hidden.
1553220	1554500	30 on an 80.
1555980	1559540	92 on a 70, but I've got that skill
1559540	1561220	that I can reroll the one thing.
1561220	1562040	Oh, 22!
1562040	1562880	Hell yeah.
1562880	1564380	That's a critical success.
1564420	1567180	Through the hole in the side of the ship,
1567180	1568340	you hold up.
1568340	1570060	My spyglass, yep.
1570060	1573780	And as you lengthen it out, you see,
1573780	1576980	through this hole.
1576980	1579060	And this burning blood from the guy
1579060	1580900	who got patrioted inside the ship.
1580900	1583420	Yeah.
1583420	1586780	Yeah, and you see a pair of legs walking around
1586780	1589880	without a top half, a walk past,
1589880	1591820	but just through the view,
1591860	1595460	you can make out the ship of fancy pyromancy
1595460	1599460	on the damn sea with its smoking, massive cannon
1599460	1600700	that they've dragged out.
1600700	1604260	They didn't even try to move forward this round.
1604260	1606840	No one was manning the sails.
1606840	1609020	They just dragged out this massive cannon
1609020	1610100	to take this shot.
1610100	1611620	They got the mother of all cannons
1611620	1613440	on that ship over there, boys!
1613440	1615480	Hey, Sheridu, but half the reason
1615480	1619020	we got them neckbeards is to be our sacrificial goat.
1619020	1620840	I say let them take that shot.
1621860	1623740	To distract the pyromancy,
1623740	1626540	we put everything we got next time into moving forward.
1626540	1629340	Well, let's keep their husk of a ship
1629340	1631540	between us and them as long as we can.
1631540	1634460	I pull out a whistle and blow on it,
1634460	1636500	and I know this isn't how monkeys hear,
1636500	1639480	but you don't hear any sounds coming out of the whistle.
1639480	1643120	It's my monkey whistle.
1643120	1643960	Exactly.
1645620	1647620	Oh, we didn't send, oh, sorry.
1649060	1650180	No, you wouldn't say, oh, sorry,
1650180	1651460	because you can't hear it.
1651460	1653960	Right, exactly, no, I didn't even.
1653960	1656180	I thought that was the introduction
1656180	1658000	of some new, mysterious, creepy sound effect.
1658000	1658920	What I was gonna say is,
1658920	1661180	I think we sent your Emperor Tamarind over,
1661180	1664580	but we had the, Mrs. Knife was gonna be the runner
1664580	1665660	between the ships, right?
1665660	1667220	Yes, yes, yes.
1667220	1668900	So that is a pretty good time
1668900	1672820	after we've decided to cut them off and move on.
1672820	1675980	I relay that to Mrs. Shark, who says.
1675980	1677500	Cut it off.
1677500	1678460	Moving on.
1680180	1684380	I didn't have a sick segue that time,
1684380	1686180	but I need another navigation roll.
1687420	1689740	And then is this where we could help?
1689740	1691540	Yeah, if you guys wanna take off
1691540	1693780	from firing at the port deserters,
1693780	1696100	then you can all really get in on pushing this ship forward.
1696100	1698940	I have something that I wanna do
1698940	1700980	to avoid being shot by that thing.
1700980	1704460	So let me ask you this before I waste time doing it.
1705640	1709020	You know how I like to mix chemicals and shit together?
1709020	1710820	You do know how you like to mix chemicals.
1710820	1711660	Does your character also do that?
1711660	1713260	Your character does that too, I think, yeah.
1713260	1714700	They say right what you know.
1716200	1718400	For the listeners, Luke is not a scientist.
1720500	1722620	I have a minor in biology.
1722620	1724460	Whoa, I didn't know that.
1724460	1725580	So you know what?
1725580	1726540	You're right.
1728780	1729680	Okay, so.
1729680	1731940	If you're a biologist, then what's wrong with me?
1731940	1733420	Oh, Joe just pulled down his pants.
1733420	1735300	Oh my God, there is.
1735300	1736340	There's too much of ya.
1736340	1737180	Look at that.
1737180	1738860	Oh, cool, there's way too much of ya.
1739700	1740820	Your blood's not flowing correctly.
1740820	1744460	If we were up in the Northeast, I'd call that a hoagie.
1746300	1747940	Here we call it a sub, I guess.
1748780	1749740	Are you a sub, Joe?
1750740	1751860	The people wanna know.
1751860	1754780	Hold on, real quick, I just need to let one lie
1754780	1756580	that went unaddressed be addressed.
1756580	1758620	When Luke says he has a minor in biology,
1758620	1761020	what he means is he fathered a child when he was 15
1761020	1765140	and that child themselves is now a freshman in high school
1765140	1767180	in Mrs. Atkinson's biology class.
1767180	1772180	I was definitely a virgin then, so you're wrong.
1773860	1775380	Speaking of.
1775380	1776340	Oh my God.
1776340	1778080	I've got very bad news, fellas.
1778080	1778920	Uh-oh.
1778920	1779860	It's at 88.
1779860	1781540	Can you re-roll one of them?
1781540	1784100	It's a dang old crit fail and no, Zach, I can't re-roll it.
1784100	1784940	That re-roll thing is going on.
1784940	1786500	And no, Zach, I don't wanna talk about it.
1786500	1789340	And no, Zach, I don't want any consequences.
1789340	1791900	I don't wanna talk about it right now.
1791900	1793820	And yet, as your hands are trembling,
1793860	1795520	unable to complete this task,
1795520	1798900	was Mr. Spitz able to save the day here?
1800280	1801980	With a sailing roll?
1801980	1804540	No, I didn't roll anything good.
1804540	1809540	Okay, is this a time where I could see
1812060	1816380	that things are going very wrong and now help?
1816380	1819100	Oh, I mean, I suppose.
1819100	1820180	Didn't you already roll?
1820180	1821020	He had not rolled yet.
1821020	1822580	No, I was not gonna help
1822580	1823980	because I had my own thing I was gonna do.
1823980	1827140	But now, this seems a whole lot more relevant
1827140	1828340	than what I was gonna do.
1828340	1829180	Good play.
1830060	1831740	What should I, anyway, I try to-
1831740	1832780	You have luck, man.
1832780	1833620	That's true.
1833620	1834440	What did you roll?
1834440	1835280	He rolled a 68.
1835280	1836700	I rolled a 68, which-
1836700	1837980	86 ain't gonna do it.
1837980	1841520	So, one luck won't work.
1841520	1843180	Okay, then I don't-
1843180	1844620	Do you spend the luck anyway?
1844620	1846740	I don't, I don't do that.
1846740	1848180	Make it more of a fail.
1848540	1852460	You wanted it to be, you know, more exciting.
1853780	1856060	I see that everything's going wrong
1856060	1857860	and I'm like, I don't think I can help.
1861220	1862660	That's how that works, right?
1862660	1865340	The port deserters are able to catch up a little bit.
1865340	1866660	They're not past you yet,
1866660	1869340	but they are catching up currently
1869340	1871580	and we are rolling again.
1872620	1874420	Joe, if I could get a rope use,
1874420	1876620	are you guys going to help him again?
1876900	1878100	What is the conversation happening
1878100	1881380	as you guys are failing at this sailing task?
1881380	1883500	Is the consequence of the crit fail
1883500	1885960	that we just don't move and don't fire for a round?
1885960	1886800	That is correct.
1886800	1888400	Okay, so I was gonna say that Waverly's
1888400	1890900	probably just in awe of that giant hole
1890900	1892340	that has now been punctured.
1892340	1893820	Like, that cannon scared him.
1893820	1895300	So, he just stood there agape.
1895300	1897100	Well, and honestly, I bet a lot of the crew is.
1897100	1900900	So, while we're running around trying to whip them up,
1900900	1902460	a lot of them are just like awestruck
1902460	1903300	by what they've just seen.
1903700	1906860	Yeah, I saw the giant hole being made
1906860	1909620	and I was racking my brain for weapons on board
1909620	1912060	that measure up to that at all and I couldn't.
1912060	1915200	And then when I see that everybody's fucking up us moving,
1915200	1917460	I kind of grab a rope and pull it,
1917460	1921220	but I'm just staring at the hole in the hole.
1921220	1922340	The hole in the hole.
1922340	1923240	The hole in the hole.
1923240	1925880	We didn't get much of anywhere this time,
1925880	1927860	but the key to defeating that gun,
1927860	1931060	eventually, if we need to, we'll be getting close to it.
1931060	1933180	It can fire at us before we can fire at it.
1934060	1935860	Not all four of that distance, right?
1935860	1937060	I've got something whipped up
1937060	1938380	that I think might be able to help.
1938380	1940820	If Jesus Christ gets here soon
1940820	1944620	or if I can run down to the bottom, I can grab it for us.
1944620	1946980	It's a special powder that I've mixed together
1946980	1951980	that I can put on a cannon ball and shoot into their cannon.
1952460	1955880	Yeah, you told me your special powder would get herpes.
1955880	1956720	Your special powder doesn't do shit.
1956720	1958260	Lots of special powders.
1958260	1959860	I gotta go look and see what I have down there.
1959860	1960800	I'm making this shit up.
1960800	1962380	I've got it all labeled.
1962380	1963220	That's what I'm saying.
1963220	1965140	I've got it all labeled down there.
1965140	1966700	Let me go take a peek.
1966700	1968760	Let me take a turn to take a peek.
1968760	1969600	Take a turnip.
1969600	1972380	He like pops a herpes sore at you in disgust.
1972380	1973780	Oh, God.
1973780	1975100	He's like, thank you, powder.
1975100	1975920	Wow.
1975920	1976940	We are pirates.
1976940	1978860	We are disgusting.
1978860	1979700	That's awful.
1979700	1980900	That's truly awful.
1980900	1984900	It goes into one of the three giant open sores on my face,
1987900	1990420	which is depicted on my character sheet.
1990420	1991260	Do you guys feel closer?
1991300	1994340	People don't know about history is that before that moment,
1994340	1996940	herpes was like totally curable, but that's great.
1999180	2003260	This is the moment where the super strain was developed.
2003260	2005500	And then eventually when I find that I have it,
2005500	2007060	I blame it on the damn monkey.
2007060	2009380	We're also both two weeks from dying from smallpox.
2009380	2012460	So it's like, this is our last hurrah.
2014780	2017100	Fancy pyromancy actually pushes forward
2017100	2019180	to where you can no longer see them.
2019180	2022720	They have turned the corner and they have disappeared
2022720	2024220	around the other side of the island,
2024220	2026180	which is thankful for the neckbeard ship
2026180	2029560	because they weren't able to fire at them this round.
2029560	2034540	However, the neckbeard ship failed miserably on their check
2034540	2038060	to combat the drowning.
2038060	2039260	What does a boat do?
2039260	2040300	Sinks.
2040300	2041140	Yep.
2041140	2043420	And so this drowning boat.
2045180	2047340	This boat is gasping for air.
2048220	2050980	This emaciated boat is drowning.
2050980	2053540	If I had to put it in terms of like math,
2053540	2056060	I'd say they started at yay 20 or so
2056060	2058780	and are down to three hit points on the ship.
2058780	2060020	Not going well.
2060020	2063540	And they critically failed and unable to help themselves
2063540	2065860	with an additional set of crew members.
2065860	2070100	They are actually moving backwards a little bit in space.
2070100	2071040	From what we can tell,
2071040	2072880	does it look like most of that damage
2072880	2073980	came from that one shot?
2073980	2074940	Oh yes.
2074940	2075780	Okay.
2075780	2076600	Horrifying.
2076720	2078720	Truly, truly horrifying.
2078720	2081440	And the port deserters are actually picking up steam now.
2081440	2085800	They are now two successful sailing moves in a row
2085800	2089280	and it is on you guys to catch up in this moment.
2090360	2092440	That's a 37 on a 70.
2092440	2093280	We're good.
2093280	2094100	That'll do it.
2094100	2096460	And you move up forward ahead of them again.
2096460	2099900	You guys are inching ahead of each other at each time,
2099900	2102760	just pushing nose to nose in this race.
2102760	2106420	I wanna take this moment to call Mrs. Knife
2107180	2109380	and while she's flying over, say to you guys,
2109380	2112500	what do you think about evacuating some key personnel
2112500	2116660	from the neckpits, including Mitch's mom and her barrel
2116660	2118340	and you know, Jesus Christ.
2119260	2120420	Getting them back on here.
2120420	2122020	It looks like their boat's done for.
2122020	2126300	We need Jesus and if they've got enough,
2127800	2129900	I think the way we get Jesus over here,
2129900	2133140	put as many men in those boats or however we do it.
2133220	2136460	I was thinking the parrot could bring Jesus over here
2136460	2139220	but do you think the parrot could bring over a human being?
2139220	2141380	You know, so we've got little boats
2141380	2142760	that go between the boats.
2142760	2143600	Right.
2143600	2145700	Can bring people over and monkeys, really.
2145700	2147220	Right, that's what I said.
2147220	2148700	I imagine that's how you,
2148700	2150860	you said the parrot would carry them.
2150860	2153500	Well, I said we could, the same way we could.
2153500	2156740	Your question was, the parrot could maybe carry a monkey
2156740	2158020	but could it carry a man?
2158020	2160420	I was talking about boats to begin with
2160420	2162820	and then I thought about the parrot bringing the monkey over
2163340	2166400	and then I'm like, well, could the parrot bring a human over?
2166400	2168180	But yeah, boats is what I was talking about.
2168180	2171400	I don't know the capability of Dr. Shark's parrots
2171400	2172700	all that well, you know,
2172700	2174860	it's capable of in the extremes
2174860	2176700	but I'm gonna say no, it can't.
2176700	2177820	But yeah, the boats.
2177820	2180080	Bring over as many men as we can get
2180080	2183500	and I've got to go look for powders and potions.
2183500	2185900	Waverly pulls out a whistle that's like a
2185900	2189000	and that sends a few bread about boats.
2189000	2190420	Yeah, the orders are sent.
2190420	2191740	The orders are sent, yeah.
2191780	2193620	So if the parrot's coming over.
2193620	2194740	Oh, the parrot's coming over.
2194740	2198140	You can hear Miss Knife, the wings flapping hard
2198140	2202620	against this crisp summer sunshine air.
2202620	2204260	Salty, baby, it's salty.
2204260	2207060	So as the parrot flies up, I say,
2207060	2210700	Mrs. North, you've got to lead the boats.
2210700	2212820	Tell them to gather all the best men
2212820	2216100	along with Mrs. Diggory and her barrel.
2216100	2217680	You bring them back over here.
2217680	2219300	Make sure the flow doesn't stop.
2219300	2221500	Yes, do not interrupt the flow.
2222100	2223700	That is of critical importance.
2223700	2225140	Bring them back over here.
2225140	2227580	We're leaving the mech beard, the ship
2227580	2230540	and a weaker crew to their fights.
2230540	2231580	You understand?
2231580	2234620	Mrs. Knife says, cut it off.
2234620	2236120	Moving on.
2236120	2237120	Fuck yeah, dude.
2237120	2242120	And with that, she takes off back to the other ship
2242860	2244900	and we are on.
2244900	2247680	Joe, I need to know what way the Adler is up to
2247680	2248520	as you roll.
2249280	2252360	Oh shit, it's a 95.
2252360	2256000	I'm gonna have to use another luck to make it a 59.
2256000	2257860	I'm down to one luck, my boys.
2257860	2259600	But I don't feel like we can afford
2259600	2261120	not moving at this point.
2261120	2263780	No, I mean, this is the time to be spending it.
2263780	2265440	I don't know if we want to set a precedent
2265440	2267440	that we explain the luck roll,
2267440	2269880	but he was turning, he thought he was turning
2269880	2271480	toward the wind and he realized,
2271480	2273280	oh fuck, it's the wrong, I mean,
2273280	2274320	readjusted real quick.
2274320	2276120	And then he actually caught a pretty good stream.
2276120	2280160	I'm all for narrative explanations of the dice roll.
2280160	2281440	I just say that because there's times
2281440	2284080	where it may be really hard to describe.
2284080	2284920	That's true.
2284920	2286360	And that's where we get created.
2286360	2287280	I dropped the gun.
2288280	2290520	That is one thing I do like about a D20 system
2290520	2294800	over maybe the D100 is the implicit scale.
2294800	2296680	One being shitty, 20 being awesome.
2296680	2299400	You know what a 15 is, you know what a 10 is.
2299400	2300220	Sure.
2300220	2301060	You know what a five is.
2301060	2302960	I usually do that and then I times it by five.
2302960	2307240	I feel the same way about the D100 system.
2307240	2309560	Well, I would if Delta Green didn't use the weird,
2309560	2312280	like actually lower rolls are not better.
2312280	2313760	I love the blackjack rules.
2313760	2316640	It makes me so happy.
2316640	2317680	I like them too.
2317680	2319040	It's just, I don't know.
2319040	2321260	Well, the port deserters push ahead of you guys,
2321260	2322100	unfortunately.
2322100	2323600	Don't give a fuck, Zach.
2327120	2330000	He wants to talk about the fucking game we're playing.
2330000	2332160	The boat from the neckbeard ship
2332200	2333840	starts heading toward you guys.
2333840	2336120	They're actually heading at the correct angle
2336120	2338440	to meet you on your way,
2338440	2342320	but they are going to have to make it around
2342320	2346160	the port deserters ship in order to make it to you
2346160	2348320	as you are right next to each other.
2348320	2351200	I would think that there are the rules of war
2351200	2354480	where you don't shoot at a abandoning ship, you know.
2354480	2356360	A tiny little ship.
2356360	2360640	Unfortunately, we're pirates and we'll slay anything.
2360640	2364120	And so my thought is shoot them before they shoot us then.
2364960	2366040	Give it to me, baby.
2366040	2368680	I'm down in, I don't see any of this happening.
2368680	2369720	I'm down in the ship.
2369720	2373680	I need you to roll for finding the correct chemicals
2373680	2376100	to create this bomb.
2376100	2378160	Which has the chemical symbol NEMO.
2378160	2380000	I'm looking at like pre-made, you know,
2380000	2382200	stuff I've made already.
2382200	2383340	Where's the NEMO?
2383340	2386720	The Necrotic Emulsifying Master.
2386720	2387560	Ooz.
2387560	2388380	Good.
2388380	2389220	Ooz.
2389220	2390500	Can this be a...
2390500	2391580	No, it can't be.
2391580	2393260	I don't even want to argue that.
2393260	2394080	Uh...
2394080	2399080	Thank you, friend.
2400220	2402060	What were you going to say?
2402060	2402900	What were you going to say?
2402900	2405580	Can this be a heavy weapons roll that I just rolled?
2405580	2407200	Oh, to find it?
2407200	2411440	To find my chemicals that I'm going to use as a weapon.
2411440	2412380	No, I would say like,
2412380	2413660	if you're trying to distinguish
2413660	2415180	between your stash of chemicals,
2415180	2418180	knowing which one you use to make the heavy weapons like...
2418180	2420060	Well, yeah, I'm thinking like I've got a wall
2420060	2422420	of like just shit like I've made already.
2422420	2423580	What's your heavy weapons skill?
2423580	2424420	80.
2424420	2425240	What'd you roll?
2425240	2427700	An 86, which I could use luck to make a 68.
2427700	2429940	How would you feel if you had to find the right gun
2429940	2432440	out of a big rack of guns and used a firearm skill?
2432440	2433340	Yeah, that's correct.
2433340	2434700	Tight.
2434700	2435580	Then I do it.
2435580	2436940	I use my luck.
2436940	2437980	Use that luck, baby.
2437980	2438860	I appreciate that.
2438860	2442380	You grab the wrong one and make it to the doorway
2442380	2444260	and then something clicks in your head.
2444260	2445340	You give it a big sniff.
2445340	2448160	Well, I sniff it and I'm like,
2449000	2450720	wait, this is literally to make it.
2450720	2452080	This is a stink bomb.
2452080	2453560	This is a stink bomb.
2453560	2457160	And so I run back and I grabbed the one that basically
2457160	2460860	it creates a cloud where like fire cannot happen in it.
2460860	2463080	So they can't shoot any weapons.
2463080	2464960	That's what I want to grab.
2464960	2465800	It's a cloud.
2465800	2467920	It's a cloud where fire can not happen?
2467920	2470080	It's a cloud where fire can not happen.
2470080	2471480	Such a bigger ask.
2471480	2474840	Like we fire this onto their ship
2474840	2477720	and it's basically like fire extinguisher shit.
2478280	2480640	Like fire extinguisher shit explodes
2480640	2482720	and so they can't fire any of their cannons
2482720	2483560	because there's no fire.
2483560	2484400	It gets all over their stuff.
2484400	2486920	They can't get any of the wicks lit, yeah.
2486920	2488160	No wicks.
2488160	2490240	But I'm gonna keep both to where it's that
2490240	2494300	and a stink bomb so that it gets funny.
2496400	2498720	All right, well, that's awesome.
2498720	2499560	And then I run back up.
2499560	2502560	And then you run back up and that's gonna be
2502560	2503500	your turn this round.
2503500	2505260	I love that so much.
2505260	2507040	All right, well, we better get going.
2507040	2508660	Tick tock on these wicks.
2511440	2512280	What is it?
2512280	2513740	Dink, dink, the dink, dink man.
2514920	2518200	Oh, that's a critical success for the port deserters.
2518200	2519360	Fuck you.
2520360	2521640	Fuck you.
2521640	2524320	They're about to be some sticky like smelly bitches.
2524320	2526440	You know what's really handy for you guys
2526440	2529700	is that the port deserters make it so far ahead of you
2529700	2532120	that the neckbeard ship can actually meet up with you
2532120	2534140	this round with no issue.
2534140	2539140	But I do need a sailing role from Sir Wavy Adler.
2539340	2540940	Are they aboard now?
2540940	2541760	Who?
2541760	2542600	The neckbeards.
2542600	2543420	No, not yet.
2543420	2544260	They will be next round.
2544260	2546380	When they're aboard, can they aid our sailing
2546380	2549780	like with more, literally more guys in the fucking like,
2549780	2550620	in the rigging?
2550620	2553540	If Mrs. Diggory and the monkey,
2553540	2555300	the monkey will be a lot of help, I assume.
2555300	2557460	We talked about bringing over all the best neckbeards.
2557460	2559580	Oh, you were bringing all the, I wasn't listening.
2559580	2560420	So you guys.
2560700	2562540	All right.
2562540	2564300	Why can't the lady and the monkey
2564300	2566340	help the ship go faster, Zach?
2567780	2569460	That's how sailing ships work.
2569460	2571580	You've got one old lady and a monkey.
2571580	2572420	Monkeys are way stronger than you think.
2572420	2575140	Have you never sailed, you fucking peasant?
2575140	2576780	How much advantage do you want?
2577940	2578780	Well, preferably like-
2578780	2581140	I was thinking one giant long boat full of like-
2581140	2581980	Double or triple.
2581980	2586740	The hardest pirates with the biggest know-hows.
2586740	2588040	Exactly.
2588040	2590160	We got an old lady, the boat goes faster,
2590840	2591680	you fucking mook.
2591680	2593000	Extra blood, baby.
2597760	2599800	Erupting out of the ocean,
2599800	2603360	in between you and the shore of this island,
2603360	2607320	seemingly every bit of blood that has been trailing
2607320	2610520	out of these massive barrels
2610520	2612960	on the back of all of these ships,
2612960	2617520	all the blood is beginning to bubble on the ocean's top.
2617560	2620520	And as it bubbles, it is creating a steam
2620520	2622520	that is creating a fog that is-
2622520	2627520	And masking all of your surroundings,
2628240	2630480	the ship that is just nearby.
2630480	2632360	I mean, it is right there.
2632360	2634060	They're about to board.
2634060	2637960	And then all of a sudden, gone in fog,
2637960	2639880	you are completely surrounded.
2639880	2643480	You can barely see the hand in front of your face
2643520	2647560	and you can hear your entire crew panic
2647560	2651280	over the sound of Mitch Diggory getting even louder.
2667360	2672360	And you see that fog just billowing thicker and thicker
2672720	2674680	as you continue to sail the ship.
2674680	2679000	Oh, neckbeards, ahoy, are you out there?
2679000	2680080	Roll the sanity.
2683320	2684440	I pass mine.
2684440	2685480	I also pass mine.
2685480	2687200	And I'm gonna go ahead.
2687200	2689840	You're asking me to think of a way to use my skills
2689840	2691600	to get these guys aboard.
2691600	2692720	I've got the perfect one.
2692720	2694540	I'm gonna use spot hidden again
2694540	2696400	to search them out through the fog
2696400	2699540	and guide them in with my voice basically.
2700640	2701600	And 18.
2701640	2703080	Okay, yeah, that'll do it.
2703080	2705400	They follow the sound of your voice.
2705400	2710400	Ahoy, neckbeards, ahoy, your scrawny ass is up.
2710760	2712040	Get aboard.
2712040	2714080	It's a contest to win.
2714080	2715960	And you can tell by these dark seas
2715960	2718060	that there'll be hell to pay if we don't.
2719040	2723100	It's a perfect tone to cut through this fog.
2723100	2727360	And it is now blocking out the sun completely.
2727360	2730640	So it is dark aboard your ship.
2730640	2734160	Mrs. Diggory is still, what?
2734160	2735080	With her barrel.
2735080	2737080	Yeah, I get her and the barrel set up
2737080	2739040	next to Mitch basically.
2739040	2742120	But then I have my sword out and I look at Mitch
2742120	2745640	and I say, boy, without you finishing your words,
2745640	2748160	you should nod yes and no.
2748160	2751040	If we lose this thing, are we dead?
2752660	2754280	And he nods.
2754280	2758060	If we lose this thing, are you and your mother dead?
2758060	2761760	And a tear starts welling up in his eyes.
2763260	2764100	And he nods.
2764100	2764940	Cut his throat.
2767260	2769060	It's still better to have two of them,
2769060	2771180	though I'm of your way of thinking.
2771180	2774060	I'm not around enough for you to hear me say that.
2774060	2775860	No, you popped up on board.
2775860	2778700	You popped up with your chemical mounted cannon
2778700	2779540	in your cannon.
2779540	2780980	Yeah, I look around, I'm like,
2780980	2783140	squint, I'm like, oh, cut his throat.
2784860	2785700	I'm a pirate, so.
2785700	2787680	Mrs. Knife disagrees, she prefers torture
2788160	2789520	and she suggests.
2789520	2790460	Cut the legs.
2792720	2796920	And her little wings are flapping the fog away from her,
2796920	2801280	so you can see, you can always see Mrs. Knife a little bit
2801280	2805760	as cutting through this fog, no matter where she goes.
2805760	2807600	Like fucking crackers on that season of Archer,
2807600	2808720	everybody but me hated.
2810280	2811400	I love that season.
2811400	2812440	I love that one too.
2812440	2814100	It's one of the internet's least favorites
2814100	2816160	and it's like, that's the best coma season.
2816160	2818080	Adam Reed admitted during the Dreamland one,
2818080	2821440	he was on a lot of pain pills for a surgery
2821440	2824660	and it's like a really dark and fucked up and weird tone.
2825520	2829480	What is Wavy Adler up to as he's trying to get the crew
2829480	2832200	working together while they can't see each other?
2832200	2834320	He's using that whistle that he whipped out earlier
2834320	2836200	and he's actually prepared for this.
2836200	2838740	You enter fog fairly often as a sailor,
2838740	2841200	so they kind of know how to navigate through fog.
2841200	2844400	So he's doing whistle commands that mean the things
2844400	2846140	that we've been meaning all along.
2847100	2849860	So it's like, means to get up on the ropes.
2849860	2854460	And it's just this super like absolute fog.
2854460	2858140	And each one of these people who are working on your ship
2858140	2863140	as the crew, they're just individually moving by themselves
2863380	2866100	with no idea of like what is happening.
2866100	2868140	That knows what individually means.
2868140	2873140	Yeah, but I just figured out that other people
2874620	2875720	can do that too.
2876980	2879820	I looked at Thomas and I was like, come on, don't do it.
2883020	2884260	I'm like, he's on a roll.
2886580	2888780	I almost stopped when I saw the look on your face,
2888780	2892720	but then the way Joe and Zach got got, I stand by it.
2894260	2896340	I need to roll through the fog, baby.
2896340	2897800	These whistles are making it
2897800	2899460	so you don't have to be at a penalty.
2899460	2900940	It's a 63, I passed.
2900940	2902020	Congratulations.
2903220	2906020	You need three more successes to make it
2906840	2907680	in a full circle.
2907680	2911060	Something in your pirate bones tells you
2911060	2913240	that you're exactly three successes away
2913240	2914780	from completing this circle.
2914780	2917980	Your navigational skills trying to figure out
2917980	2920460	exactly where to meet back up with it.
2920460	2922700	Please roll a navigation for me right now.
2924000	2926380	That's a pass, a 36 on an 80.
2926380	2928600	Navigation's technically my best skill.
2928600	2930460	I should have been using that more.
2930460	2935120	You can now hear in the distance right in front of you
2935120	2938200	the chanting from two other ships.
2938200	2939320	Fuck yes.
2939320	2942520	Nearby, but they're in the fog.
2942520	2945600	Okay, so I turn to Mitch and I ask him,
2945600	2948520	man, does your chanting have to be loud?
2948520	2951520	He gets a confused look on his face.
2951520	2954600	Can you whisper the chant?
2954600	2958720	Erwah, yoh, yee, yerp.
2958720	2960200	Tell mother to.
2960200	2961040	Eh.
2961040	2961860	Blerp.
2961860	2962700	Woot.
2962700	2963540	All right, boy.
2963540	2964360	Oh no.
2964680	2966440	She fucked up, she broke the chant.
2968140	2969920	Hey, hey, Zach fucked up.
2971800	2973200	Mrs. Diggory.
2973200	2974320	Oh no.
2974320	2976040	You gotta roll for Mrs. Diggory.
2976040	2976880	All right.
2976880	2978400	That was you, bro, not her.
2978400	2981040	She chugged some grog on the boat.
2981040	2982440	She got in that boat.
2982440	2984800	She was like, oh, oh no.
2984800	2985840	What'd you get?
2985840	2986680	It's an 88.
2987880	2989200	She falls overboard.
2990400	2991360	Oh my God.
2991360	2994680	She coughs and then looks down and then looks scared
2994680	2997680	and then looks at Mitch and she's like, I'm so sorry.
2997680	2999600	I'm so, I'm so sorry.
2999600	3000800	You have to keep going.
3000800	3002720	You have to keep going for us.
3002720	3003540	You have to keep going.
3003540	3005800	Now we're together, we can make this.
3005800	3006840	We can make it together.
3006840	3009000	I just put my finger to my lips
3009000	3011240	and give her a look like, we're pirates
3011240	3013480	and we're gonna kill you if you don't stop talking right now.
3013480	3015680	Your three faces are the only things
3015680	3019040	that can be seen in this massive fog around
3019080	3021760	and your hand reaches up out of nowhere
3021760	3024000	to put a finger to your mouth
3024000	3025640	and she quickly silences
3025640	3028880	and then disappears backwards into the fog.
3028880	3030080	All right.
3030080	3031700	Wavy, what do you think?
3031700	3033200	Silence all hands,
3033200	3035760	slip by noise and quiet between the fog.
3035760	3036920	We'll never know we were there.
3036920	3038400	I love this idea.
3038400	3039760	I love this idea.
3039760	3040600	That's the idea.
3040600	3042400	Stealthy as she goes, boys.
3042400	3043240	And perhaps if-
3043240	3044080	Stealthy as she goes.
3044080	3046400	As soon as we bust out of the fog on the other side,
3046440	3049080	you give them a load of that special powder of yours.
3049080	3052280	I hand Jesus Christ like an empty iron ball.
3052280	3053880	What does Jesus Christ look like again?
3053880	3055920	He is an emperor, tamarind, penguin,
3055920	3058600	so he's got the big mustache, monkey mustache.
3058600	3059440	I thought he was a monkey.
3059440	3062000	Penguin, did I say emperor, tamarind, penguin?
3062000	3063640	Yeah, you did.
3063640	3064680	Oh, no.
3064680	3065520	Emperor, tamarind.
3065520	3066760	You sent a monkey to the other ship
3066760	3067600	and you got a penguin.
3067600	3069440	He came back and there is some fucky stuff
3069440	3071240	happening on this island.
3071240	3072840	No, it's my monkey.
3073900	3075480	And he, I hand him-
3075520	3076560	He's a fucking penguin.
3076560	3077920	This guy, he keeps calling it a monkey,
3077920	3078960	but that's a penguin.
3081360	3082280	We just let him have it.
3082280	3083120	We let him have it,
3083120	3084800	but he's going to some one of these days.
3084800	3085960	We're gonna go up too far north
3085960	3087360	and that penguin's gonna die.
3088320	3093320	So this penguin, who I see still as a monkey,
3094520	3097200	is mixing together the stinky stuff
3097200	3101400	and the not fire stuff, putting it in this iron ball.
3101400	3105080	And then I load it into my shoulder cannon.
3105680	3108600	And I wait until I can see where I'm gonna shoot it.
3108600	3109440	Awesome.
3109440	3113640	In that exact moment, as I get a roll from Wavy Adler,
3113640	3116520	you hear in the distance the crew
3116520	3118920	from Fancy Pyromancy on the Damsey.
3118920	3120520	You haven't been able to hear them yet,
3120520	3123820	but everyone is being so quiet in this fog,
3123820	3126980	except just in the distance, you hear some scrambling.
3128120	3131720	Oh, oh, oh, yes, no, oh, we cannot find it.
3131720	3134600	Oh, no, we have to make it back to the original location.
3134960	3136480	Yes, to make the circle complete.
3136480	3138280	No, we haven't quite made it back
3138280	3140160	to the original circle yet, no.
3140160	3143180	I passed the sailing roll, it's a 12.
3143180	3145280	And a navigation for me, please.
3145280	3146120	Another one?
3146120	3146940	Yes.
3149160	3150680	45 on an 80.
3150680	3151880	Oh, yes, beautiful.
3151880	3152720	Fuck yeah.
3152720	3157560	All in the same round, Fancy Pyromancy on the Damsey,
3157560	3160640	the Port Deserters, and Death of a Salesman
3160680	3164980	have all completed their circle of the island.
3164980	3168960	None of you have yet to complete the circle
3168960	3172320	by finding the other end of your blood trail,
3172320	3177320	which is now a thick, red fog that you can see.
3177760	3181520	As the fog is coming around you, you see that ahead of you,
3181520	3186520	where the fog is literally boiling up out of the ocean,
3186720	3190960	it's red, and your trails are each lighting up red,
3190960	3194560	and these massive walls going up to the sky,
3194560	3196800	but you can't even see the sky anymore.
3196800	3198840	There's nothing except for fog.
3198840	3200600	Mitch, I have one more question for you.
3200600	3203840	What do you think?
3203840	3205000	If we win,
3205000	3208200	what do we die?
3208200	3211280	He gets a big smile on his face,
3211280	3213060	and he shakes his head no.
3213980	3217400	All right, Edward Spitz is fucking stoked.
3219060	3221120	And he's gonna try to do a Spot Hidden role
3221120	3223900	to find our blood smoke in the fog.
3223900	3225740	Fuck yeah, fuck yeah.
3225740	3227420	And passes with a 25 on an eight.
3227420	3228260	Hell yeah.
3228260	3231660	Awesome, so that is gonna be your first success.
3231660	3236660	I've basically given each team three navigation successes
3237180	3239600	to find the other end of the trail.
3239600	3243040	So Edward Spitz, he used Spot Hidden,
3243040	3245920	which implies some visuals, but he's a pirate.
3245920	3247940	He uses all of his senses.
3247940	3249880	As he searches through his spyglass,
3249880	3251480	he sees nothing, but all of a sudden,
3251480	3254460	he just catches a whiff of blood on the wind,
3254460	3256600	and then sees a little wisp of red
3256600	3258940	in the direction that he smelled that.
3258940	3262320	And he tells Wavy, he's like, that way.
3262320	3264420	Wavy, go ahead and roll that navigation.
3264660	3265660	That's a 25.
3267660	3270980	As you guys push forward into this,
3270980	3275980	you hear a low rumble in the distance.
3275980	3280980	And each one of you can feel the ocean approaching.
3281540	3284780	Waves are heading toward you,
3284780	3288980	massive waves from the island side.
3290780	3293780	And then you finally get to the end of the trail.
3293820	3296620	And then you finally hear it, this massive noise,
3296620	3299320	this explosion of a ship,
3299320	3303780	wood splintering in all different directions,
3303780	3308540	and the cries of an entire ship's crew
3308540	3311180	all at once through the fog.
3311180	3316180	Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no, oh fuck, oh shit, oh god, no!
3321700	3322700	Not ours, right?
3322700	3326100	No, it's in the distance through the fog.
3326100	3328580	Why, thank god that's not our ship.
3328580	3330900	I was really scared, I really fucking scared
3330900	3332060	the piss out of me.
3332060	3333900	I thought I looked around and I was like,
3333900	3335980	I can't see anything, and I don't know if it was.
3335980	3338580	In one group of pirates screaming in agony and terror,
3338580	3339420	sounds much like another.
3339420	3340860	Jesus Christ.
3340860	3342180	I mean, I really thought that was some more,
3342180	3344980	I thought I heard fucking Fat Johnny
3344980	3347260	just squealing his little head off.
3347260	3351100	Anyway, well fuck, have you smelled the blood yet?
3351100	3352080	I smelled it a little bit.
3352320	3353160	We're heading that way now.
3353160	3353980	I thought, I thought I could.
3353980	3355520	Holy fucking shit.
3356360	3358800	Oh, like they said that back then.
3358800	3362880	Suddenly, all the fog that isn't red completely dissipates
3362880	3365860	and you can only see these massive walls
3365860	3367880	that encircle the island.
3367880	3370600	Boom, boom, boom, out like a bullseye.
3370600	3372300	If you were looking at this from above,
3372300	3375680	it would look like a Target logo, but with more of them.
3375680	3377620	And Edward just shouts, I see it.
3377820	3382820	You notice in this moment that it seems
3382820	3387540	that the port deserters did not complete their own circle.
3387540	3390100	They completed the neck beard circle.
3390100	3394560	And in that moment, something absolutely obliterated
3394560	3396940	their ship from the inside. Holy shit.
3396940	3401940	And all of them are on the boiling ocean floor,
3402580	3407340	floor, ceiling, ocean, ocean ground.
3408260	3409420	Ocean surface.
3409420	3410540	I like roof though.
3410540	3411740	The roof of the ocean.
3411740	3412940	The roof of the ocean.
3414620	3417700	It probably is roof in like 99 out of a hundred languages
3417700	3418740	or some shit.
3418740	3419940	Yeah, right?
3419940	3421780	If you're a fish making the language,
3421780	3424620	it would definitely be your roof.
3424620	3427260	There's gotta be so many fish languages too.
3427260	3429340	Oh yeah.
3429340	3430820	Oh, comparatively.
3430820	3434100	We've got to break the ocean ceiling, you know?
3434100	3437120	The death of a salesman and fancy pyromancy on the damn sea
3437560	3441960	seem to be equidistant from their individual,
3441960	3443760	nice, finishing line.
3445480	3446320	Yeah.
3446320	3447520	Yeah, sorry.
3447520	3449080	I didn't want to break you for language,
3449080	3450880	but you did it right.
3450880	3451720	Yeah.
3451720	3452540	You said all those words.
3452540	3454440	I thought about telling you that you got it totally wrong
3454440	3455280	and gaslighting you.
3455280	3456120	I know.
3457480	3459560	I thought about being like Zach thinks equidistant
3459560	3460400	means the same distance.
3460400	3461720	That is not what it means, dude.
3463640	3464480	It does.
3464480	3465320	It does though.
3465320	3466600	Oh yeah.
3467040	3469040	I couldn't see my face, but I'm like, wait.
3470760	3474000	We're totally gonna make him believe that equidistant means.
3474000	3474840	Equidistant.
3475840	3478280	Sorry, I had to take off my headphones for a second.
3478280	3479660	Where were we?
3479660	3481720	We were equidistant, bro.
3481720	3486720	Oh man.
3486760	3489240	I bet even if we talk about how like this will be a bit
3489240	3491760	where we gaslight Zach into believing equidistant
3491760	3493080	doesn't mean what it means,
3493080	3495400	we could still carry it out and like get him to believe it
3495400	3496600	for a lot of the season.
3496600	3497440	What do you think?
3497440	3499600	The thing is I need to fire your cannons.
3499600	3500640	I need to fire my cannons.
3500640	3501800	I want you to describe.
3501800	3502620	Okay, yeah.
3503500	3505040	Well, I've got to get rid of this.
3505040	3509000	And so as the fog clears on this ship,
3509000	3511560	everyone sees you walking down from the top,
3511560	3515880	walking down the steps to the deck, carrying what?
3515880	3517720	The fog is dissipating at his sides
3517720	3521400	as he's slowly walking toward the front with his.
3521400	3522800	Well, walking towards the back, right?
3522800	3523880	Cause they're behind us now.
3523880	3525440	They are equidistant.
3527120	3530600	It would be the front popping out of the fog.
3530600	3531520	The side, yeah.
3531520	3536000	Yeah, and Al has basically just like a small cannon
3536000	3537080	on his shoulder.
3537080	3539860	He lights a match off the cannon,
3539860	3543160	hands it to Jesus Christ, his monkey.
3543160	3545700	Jesus Christ grabs the tip of your cannon
3545700	3548960	and angles it way higher.
3548960	3550360	Oh, wait, what?
3550360	3551380	Oh, right, penguin.
3554720	3556720	It's totally a monkey, but the pirates don't know
3556720	3557560	what a penguin is.
3557560	3559120	They're like, that's a penguin.
3559120	3560480	He's going to kill that penguin.
3560480	3562360	It lifts up the top of the cannon
3562360	3565160	to give you an extra bit of boost.
3565160	3567840	And the Timurine Monkey is going to assist your role
3567840	3569760	by lifting your cannon and showing you,
3569760	3573680	we're going to have to fire really fucking far
3573680	3576400	because we're back to the, almost the starting line.
3576400	3578640	And you remember Fancy Pyromancy on the DMC
3578640	3580640	was basically out of cannon mode.
3580640	3581960	And he was just like,
3581960	3584520	the monkey on the DMC was basically out of cannon range
3584520	3585680	when we started.
3585680	3590440	Thank God I found a monkey with geometry skills
3590440	3593760	and like way higher thinking than I have.
3596680	3597880	Let's roll this, baby.
3598880	3600480	68 on an 80.
3600480	3602680	21 on a monkey.
3605180	3606620	Oh, yes, he won.
3606620	3608240	All right, go ahead and roll.
3608240	3609080	What is this?
3609080	3609920	It's a shoulder cannon.
3609920	3610760	Yeah, it's a shoulder cannon.
3610760	3614080	It's a firing combination of stinky potion
3614080	3616560	and giant fire extinguisher potion.
3616560	3618000	Is this mounted on your shoulder
3618000	3620640	and the monkey is like adjusting its trajectory
3620640	3622280	or is the monkey on your shoulder
3622280	3623840	and the cannon's on its shoulder?
3623840	3626240	The cannon is on my right shoulder.
3626240	3629640	The monkey's on my left shoulder adjusting it for me.
3629640	3631720	Generally, I would have like two people
3631720	3634240	like bracing me to do this,
3634240	3637080	but I don't need to, so I mean, it's-
3637080	3638420	He calls them Jesus Christ,
3638460	3641100	but we call him Trajectory the Gunnery Monkey.
3641100	3645300	The monkey lights the cannon ball and we wait.
3647300	3648940	And as we're waiting, we're gonna see
3648940	3651780	if they can succeed on this navigation check
3651780	3654380	at the same time as Wavy Adler
3654380	3656940	to find out if we're gonna finish this race
3656940	3659200	before this fucking bomb goes off.
3659200	3660040	Okay.
3665480	3667180	I got a 94.
3667180	3670280	I'm gonna use my very last luck to make it a 49.
3670280	3671600	Fuck yeah.
3671600	3672420	Hell yeah.
3672420	3673260	When did you roll though?
3673260	3676440	I rolled a 59 and they have a 60.
3676440	3677280	Oh.
3679680	3682700	But because of Luke's cannon going off
3682700	3684840	in that exact moment,
3684840	3688400	as they're about to reach their blood trail,
3688400	3690020	it's right in front of them
3690020	3693380	and the fog is taking over the front of their ship,
3693380	3697560	but it hasn't quite made it to the back barrel yet.
3697560	3700640	And in that final moment, right before you fired,
3700640	3703560	the monkey tilted the cannon just a little bit further
3703560	3705080	to the back of their ship.
3706080	3707960	And you see this thing just-
3709560	3710400	Ew.
3712900	3713740	And then-
3716280	3718120	Oh God, what's that smell?
3718680	3719520	That's the stink bomb part of it
3719520	3723280	as it mixes with the blood from inside the barrel
3723280	3728160	on the back of this ship as blood explodes everywhere
3728160	3731800	and Wavy Adler leads the death of a salesman
3731800	3734920	directly through the red fog,
3734920	3738940	right through until it takes over Mitch as he says,
3738940	3739780	what?
3741640	3742480	Okay.
3742480	3743320	What?
3744040	3744880	Boom.
3747200	3752200	In that moment, the red fog that you have created
3752480	3757480	completely disappears down into the water.
3757480	3761080	Every other circle, each of them,
3761080	3764520	one at a time going toward the island,
3764520	3767360	boom, boom, boom,
3767360	3771040	fog and maybe stone, some sort of cement
3771040	3772640	you've never seen anything like it,
3772880	3775080	erupting from out of the ocean.
3775080	3777240	As each of these walls go up,
3777240	3781240	blocking off the island from view, the fog fucking like,
3781240	3783920	each one of these walls moves forward
3783920	3787420	and the island disappears from view.
3787420	3791120	The fog is the only thing that you can see.
3791120	3794920	And in that moment, I need all of you to roll sanity.
3794920	3798000	Holy shit, this is fucking awesome, dude.
3799240	3800960	I passed 33 on a 60.
3801000	3803240	I also passed a 63 on an 80.
3804280	3807200	I have 90 sanity.
3807200	3810400	The wall next to you created a massive wave
3810400	3813280	that pushes you out further to sea
3813280	3815520	and directs the tip of your boat away
3815520	3817880	from where the island once was.
3817880	3820540	The fog behind you dissipates.
3821520	3825860	There is absolutely nothing there.
3825860	3826700	What's wrong?
3826700	3828680	Well, what did we do wrong, Mitch?
3828680	3829600	Where's the island?
3829600	3830480	I don't know.
3830920	3831760	How do we win this thing?
3831760	3836440	Mother, mother, I thought that, is it over?
3836440	3837640	She walks up to him,
3837640	3839240	she's looking off the side of the ship.
3839240	3842280	She's like, I suppose it's done.
3843600	3844840	Huh?
3844840	3846060	You fucking fools.
3846900	3849400	You rich fucking fools.
3849400	3850640	You killed all these men.
3851880	3854200	It's just to throw them walls up.
3854200	3855920	Where are my riches?
3855920	3857120	Where's Wavy's riches?
3857120	3858240	Where's the gold you mentioned?
3858240	3859260	There's a big score.
3859260	3860780	That's what we were doing this for.
3860780	3862500	Where's the fucking payout?
3862500	3866000	Al is waking up from being knocked out
3866000	3867900	by the force of his shoulder cannon
3867900	3870480	and he thinks everything is done now
3870480	3874180	so he looks up at Jesus Christ, high fives him
3874180	3877060	and stands up and then looks over at you guys.
3877060	3879820	So we did it, where's the gold and shit?
3879820	3881700	That's a great fucking question, Al.
3881700	3882940	Where is the gold?
3882940	3884460	Mom, where's the gold?
3884460	3886780	Where's our power, Mrs. Tiggory?
3886780	3890860	You have all been excellent servants and-
3890860	3893340	Oh, I don't like the sound of that.
3893340	3897720	You have completed exactly what we needed from you.
3898860	3900460	Thank you.
3900460	3901980	I have nothing for you,
3902940	3904900	but I appreciate the work that you've done.
3904900	3906260	You mean other than the gold?
3906260	3907100	Yeah, right.
3907100	3907920	Yes, that's right.
3907920	3911380	Yes, take me back to port and we will get you your gold.
3912820	3915220	The wall has disappeared and you turn back
3915260	3917820	and look at where the wall once was.
3917820	3921420	No wall, no island, no fog, it's a beautiful sunny day.
3921420	3922260	No island?
3922260	3923100	No island.
3923100	3924400	And what port does she mean?
3924400	3927180	Oh, back, you know, Jamaica.
3927180	3928580	Where's your fucking husband?
3928580	3930260	He seems to be gone.
3930260	3931540	That's a bit of a relief, isn't it?
3931540	3934740	Are there still the husks of ships sinking
3934740	3936500	or are we alone on the ocean?
3936500	3939620	You are absolutely alone on the ocean.
3939620	3941420	Mitch is still on board, right?
3941420	3943380	Mitch is still on board.
3943380	3946260	Mitch, what the fuck is going on?
3946260	3949540	And I pull my knife out, but I have a smile on my face.
3949540	3950380	But jovially.
3952740	3955740	Yeah, I actually don't know.
3955740	3959740	I mean, dad said that it would be, you know,
3959740	3961760	like world changing or whatever.
3961760	3964540	And I guess it did change the world, but.
3964540	3966500	Kill some pirates and build some walls.
3966500	3968540	Build some walls to only have them fall down again.
3968540	3970020	There's nothing left.
3970020	3973180	Was your dad fond of you and your mom?
3973900	3974740	No.
3974740	3975580	Okay, I see.
3975580	3977820	I mean, yeah, in his own way.
3977820	3980700	Yeah, but he might want to get rid of you or something.
3980700	3982940	Perhaps, maybe at some point.
3982940	3985060	I just put my flintlock to Mitch's head
3985060	3987060	and I turned to Mrs. Diggory.
3987940	3990300	You better tell us the real fucking scheme here
3990300	3992820	or I'll blow your son's brains out.
3992820	3995300	Your husband changed the world, how'd he do that?
3995300	3996380	What changed?
3996380	3997780	What did we do?
3997780	3999500	She looks at Mitch.
3999500	4001220	She looks at you.
4001220	4004580	Looks back behind her over the edge of the ship.
4006580	4008900	She takes a step backward.
4008900	4009920	I'm sorry, Mitch.
4010820	4012220	She jumps backwards.
4012220	4016020	Monkey tail in hand, monkey reaching out for.
4016020	4017580	Spitz watches her go.
4017580	4019300	So Al thinks about,
4020260	4024180	Al thinks about having, grabbing Jesus's tail
4024180	4027660	and having Jesus grab her before she falls.
4027660	4031020	But what really happens is he grabs Jesus's tail
4031700	4033700	and Jesus slaps him on the side of the head
4033700	4035100	and no safe attempt.
4036700	4039180	Yeah, she succeeded for jumping off the ship
4039180	4041940	and she splashes down into the water.
4041940	4044580	She fails her jump roll so she lands safely.
4046540	4047900	On the next deck below.
4047900	4050220	No, she jumps a couple inches in the air.
4050220	4052780	She's on the roof of the water.
4052780	4054820	Wavy turns to Mitch.
4054820	4056500	But about that gold.
4056500	4058380	Yeah, I don't think.
4058380	4060020	Oh, there is no gold.
4060020	4062460	There's no fucking gold except maybe for his father.
4062460	4063300	But we won.
4063300	4064140	We won.
4064140	4064980	Yeah, we won.
4064980	4067020	We won someone else's game.
4067020	4069260	We won someone else's game, Wavy.
4069260	4071180	This game won for us.
4071180	4074220	I turn to Mitch and I say, boy, you've got two options.
4074220	4076700	He's just staring at the spot on the deck
4076700	4078060	where his mom jumped off
4078060	4081220	and his eyes are as full of water
4081220	4084500	as they possibly could be without a single drop falling.
4084500	4086420	Mitch, it's pirate time.
4086420	4087260	It's hard.
4087500	4089740	People's moms are dead on this ship.
4089740	4091660	So unless you want to join her,
4091660	4093940	you tell us where you think your father's gone.
4093940	4094860	Oh, I don't know.
4094860	4098020	I thought you were gonna ask me to be a pirate.
4098020	4101140	You're gonna be like a prisoner pirate or something.
4101140	4101980	I mean.
4101980	4103900	Or you're gonna die unless you tell us.
4103900	4104740	Wait, but I don't know.
4104740	4107380	Can I just be a pirate without being a prisoner?
4107380	4108220	What do you know about?
4108220	4109500	You're gonna die, Mitch.
4109500	4110340	I'm sorry.
4110340	4111980	What do you know about being a pirate?
4111980	4113940	You guys probably don't have anyone
4113940	4115540	who's like good at accounting.
4115540	4116380	I could do that.
4116380	4117820	I didn't make him the offer yet.
4117820	4119060	Counting though.
4119060	4120900	I don't think any of us know how to do that.
4120900	4121940	Yeah, I can count.
4122900	4124260	As I was saying,
4124260	4126900	I don't give a shit what your pirate skills are.
4126900	4128460	We'll find a use for you on this ship.
4128460	4129300	You can count.
4129300	4130140	That's irrelevant.
4130140	4131100	I'm sorry, but that's irrelevant.
4131100	4133300	No, he's already bringing out the best in me.
4135420	4136980	I'm gonna make you a bitch intern
4136980	4138620	for about like 24 months
4138620	4140500	before you'll get anywhere near accounting
4140500	4141860	after the stunt you've pulled.
4141860	4142700	Do you understand?
4142700	4144420	Are you the captain?
4144420	4146620	No, but I'm in charge of personnel.
4151620	4152460	There's no captain,
4152460	4153660	it's a pirate democracy,
4153660	4154500	except for you.
4155500	4156340	You're at the bottom.
4156340	4157860	Wait, I can't be a part of the democracy?
4157860	4158780	No, you can't vote
4158780	4161460	unless you're a full vested crew member.
4161460	4162460	I disagree with that.
4162460	4164060	I think everybody gets a vote.
4164060	4167740	After they've been vested for six months on the ship,
4167740	4170460	until then they're provisional pirate members.
4170460	4172900	Well, I don't remember it being six months.
4172940	4174380	The voice says from the back.
4176580	4178340	Well, maybe it's not quite a democracy
4178340	4179900	now that we've saved the day, huh?
4179900	4181100	I couldn't count though.
4183460	4186540	Well, that's why we need him for democracy.
4186540	4189060	HR decision, and I've got my knife to his throat.
4189060	4192980	And I say, Mitch, where might your father have gone?
4192980	4194500	I know you don't know,
4194500	4196340	tell us your best fucking guess
4196340	4197860	or slit your throat.
4197860	4200020	Oh God, probably home.
4200020	4202060	I would guess home or the last place he was,
4202060	4202880	which was on the island,
4202880	4204440	I don't know where the island is now.
4204440	4207280	Edward is losing his patience and he like-
4207280	4208120	We can try to find the island.
4208120	4209360	We can try to find the island.
4209360	4210200	It's gone now.
4210200	4213440	And maybe that's where the treasure all along was.
4213440	4214280	Cause it's gone.
4214280	4215120	I don't know.
4215120	4216960	We're not gonna try to find an island school
4216960	4218920	and tell us where the fuck home is.
4218920	4220520	Wait, hang on though.
4220520	4223200	Mitch, if we wanted to find an island,
4223200	4224520	how would we do that?
4224520	4226400	You say that like that's something you know how to do.
4226400	4229280	I guess we just like sail back to where we just were.
4229280	4230320	What do you mean where we were?
4230320	4231240	We are where we were.
4231240	4235040	He points to like a spot in the beautiful sunshiny day
4235040	4236040	that it is now.
4236040	4238440	And he's like, wasn't the island like over there?
4238440	4240400	And hey, Wavey, super not.
4241320	4243120	But like, you know where the island was.
4243120	4244340	No, it was over there.
4244340	4246920	But I get your point.
4246920	4249160	Let's just go park our boat over top of it.
4249160	4250800	Maybe it's below?
4250800	4254200	Yeah, maybe we'll find the old bastards ground corpse.
4254200	4256160	I wanna pilot the ship over that direction
4256160	4258520	just to sit on top of the spot.
4258520	4260320	Go ahead and roll navigation for me.
4261560	4263000	Mm.
4263000	4264640	18, for the listener,
4264640	4266800	Zach was giving me his hardest poker face.
4266800	4268320	There was no, there was, it was-
4268320	4270520	While also making like cum noises.
4270520	4271360	But it also, it wasn't-
4271360	4273680	Those are like Michael Bobaro noises.
4273680	4275760	It was obviously, it was obviously a face
4275760	4278880	that was trying to not do either a frown or a smile.
4278880	4280800	It was very strongly trying to be
4280800	4282640	the most neutral face you could make.
4282640	4284760	You can see all my face right now.
4284760	4287200	So I have to be very particular.
4287200	4289960	You say try not to hide a frown or a smile
4290000	4292440	as if Zach would like hide his disappointment
4292440	4294240	if we guessed his little game.
4294240	4296120	You've stumbled right into it.
4296120	4298780	He's trying to hide that little fucking grin
4298780	4300400	from his bastard face.
4303920	4307200	Cause we're gonna be eaten by Xith, Cthulhu.
4307200	4309320	As soon as we fucking, anyway.
4309320	4310160	The last shot.
4310160	4311080	We did light up a target.
4311080	4311920	The last shot.
4315640	4318080	We're gonna go sit in the bullseye of a target.
4320360	4324440	Trust me, trust me guys, let's get over there.
4324440	4327280	You want me to navigate you.
4327280	4329560	I agree it makes sense to check out the island.
4329560	4333520	The last shot of this short story
4333520	4338440	is the death of a salesman heading toward
4338440	4343440	just a random spot in the open ocean somewhere
4343720	4346800	just Northeast of the greater Antilles
4346800	4350360	and T.S. Mayores in the North Atlantic Ocean.
4351320	4355680	Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama.
4355680	4360680	Key Lago, Montego, baby why don't we go to Key Lago.
4361080	4366080	Barbados, I wanna take it down to Coco Mo.
4366320	4370680	We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow.
4370680	4375280	That's where we wanna go.
4375280	4377880	Way down in Coco Mo.
4377880	4379840	Bahama, come on.
4382840	4383680	Dude.
4388440	4391320	No, but there's no resolution.
4391320	4392960	We don't find out.
4392960	4393800	Well, I mean.
4393800	4394640	That's a really good point.
4394640	4396560	It's like the rest of season two.
4396560	4400160	Just be sure to stock up on pirate nerd stats
4400160	4402240	and then you'll know about the history.
4402240	4403080	There you go.
4404080	4405880	Of the Dread Pirate neck beard
4405880	4410240	and the mysterious events that happened on Bullshit Island.
4410240	4414160	Also be sure to stock up on t-shirts, towels,
4414160	4416480	fanny packs, hats.
4416480	4419400	Listen, the store is launched with season two.
4419400	4420760	Get your shit.
4420760	4422760	Buy more than one for your friends,
4422760	4424880	for you just in case.
4424880	4427480	You never know how valuable this stuff's gonna be,
4427480	4429480	mint condition, so you gotta buy doubles,
4429480	4430320	you gotta buy triples.
4430320	4431680	I'm no financial expert
4431680	4433560	and this doesn't count as real financial advice,
4433560	4436680	but I will 100% guarantee that any investment you make
4436680	4439000	in a PTPP piece of merch right now
4439000	4444000	will increase 1,000 gold by the end of the decade.
4444520	4445640	That is a promise.
4447120	4447960	There you go.
4449480	4450520	We'll see you back.
4450520	4451360	We'll see you back.
4451360	4452200	We'll see you back.
4452200	4453800	We'll see you back at home.
4453800	4454640	We'll see you back.
4454640	4455480	We'll see you back.
4455480	4456320	That's the pain people say.
4456320	4457160	We'll see you back.
4457160	4458000	We'll see you back.
4458000	4458840	We'll see you back.
4458840	4459680	Hey, we'll see you back.
4459680	4461320	All I'm saying is a $43 towel today
4461840	4464760	will net you $43,000 at the end of the decade.
4464760	4465800	Wow, really?
4465800	4467120	That's such a good deal.
4467120	4470360	I was thinking more like you pay 40 bucks for it now,
4470360	4473120	it's 60 bucks in 10 years?
4473120	4475800	Just because that's what a towel would be worth probably.
4475800	4477240	Some stupid old towel.
4478800	4480480	No, but it's like a sick towel.
4480480	4481320	It's 10 years old.
4481320	4482720	It's a sick towel that you never used.
4482720	4484440	Owned by one of our listeners.
4484440	4489440	Even worse, owned by one of the hosts.
4491880	4493840	Completely disgusting.
4493840	4498040	I can smell each one of us individually nice right now.
4498960	4500160	On their own?
4500160	4501000	Oh yeah.
4501000	4502960	They said individually, didn't they?
4507800	4509360	Our smells are equidistant.
4512680	4513520	Roughly.
4514880	4515720	Good one.
4515720	4516560	Good one.
4516560	4517400	Come on.
4544440	4566280	Hey, thanks everybody for listening to this short arc here in season two of pretending
4566280	4567120	to be people.
4567120	4572160	There's going to be a few more of those for some backstory and other story goodies that
4572160	4576440	carry in with the plot of the main thread of season two.
4576440	4578240	Very fucking excited.
4578240	4583840	But I am here because I am at a loss for words.
4583840	4590000	I don't know how to say how cool it was that Beth May from Dungeons and Daddies was on
4590000	4591000	our podcast.
4591000	4592000	Here's what I'll say.
4592000	4593000	Equidistant.
4593000	4599440	I think it was like just like such a surreal moment and she was so fun to be at the table
4599440	4600440	with.
4600440	4601440	It was a dream come true.
4601440	4602440	It was awesome.
4602440	4603440	It was.
4603440	4604840	We thought there's no way in hell it could happen.
4604840	4609820	And really it turns out there is no way in hell that it can happen, but really we're
4609820	4615000	thinking Beth and she was lovely, but we got to thank her friend that she thought was huge
4615000	4616000	shout out to Travis.
4616000	4617000	Big shout out to Travis.
4617000	4618000	Big shout out.
4618000	4619000	Yeah.
4619000	4620480	Travis, if you're out there, hit us up.
4620480	4622440	Let's be real friends.
4622440	4623440	Yeah.
4623440	4624440	Cause who else do you know?
4624440	4627440	Beth May already thinks we are.
4627440	4629960	Anyway, Travis, you're out there.
4629960	4630960	We're friends now.
4631480	4635000	It's like we said, thanks Beth or whatever, but thank you Travis.
4635000	4639640	No, seriously, Beth found out that we weren't the podcast she thought she was coming on
4639640	4641760	and still came on the show.
4641760	4642760	Anyway.
4642760	4643760	So cool.
4643760	4644760	Very rad.
4644760	4645760	Go listen to Dungeons and Daddies.
4645760	4646760	Yes.
4646760	4647760	Go buy her book.
4647760	4648760	Yes.
4648760	4649760	I believe she said it was available in all bookstores.
4649760	4650760	I believe that's what she said.
4650760	4652360	Go to your bookstore and buy it.
4652360	4656680	I think she said like go to Barnes and Noble, have them order it and then go pick it up.
4656680	4657680	There you go.
4657680	4658680	Thomas?
4659000	4661800	I just think she's going to think what Luke said was really tragic.
4661800	4662800	Which part?
4662800	4663800	The Barnes and Noble part.
4663800	4664800	What about it's tragic?
4664800	4667080	You're supposed to actually see the joke was that you're supposed to preorder it at a small
4667080	4668080	local bookstore.
4668080	4669080	Oh.
4669080	4670080	You don't read.
4670080	4671080	You don't know.
4671080	4672080	I didn't even think about it.
4672080	4673080	Oh my God.
4673080	4674080	You fucking.
4674080	4678080	Why am I friends with you fucking idiots?
4678080	4679080	Okay.
4679080	4680080	Sorry.
4680080	4681080	Answer it.
4681080	4682080	Sorry I said Barnes and Noble.
4682080	4683080	Answer it.
4683080	4685680	Barnes and Noble book buying bitches.
4686680	4689680	Well, you know, support your local bookstore.
4689680	4690680	I do.
4690680	4692680	But when I think of bookstore, I think Barnes and Noble.
4692680	4694680	We got one in town.
4694680	4695680	Yeah.
4695680	4696680	But I don't buy books from there.
4696680	4698680	It's just that's where you buy books.
4715680	4725680	Because my life is great and it's all my fault.
