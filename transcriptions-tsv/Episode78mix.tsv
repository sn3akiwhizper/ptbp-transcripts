0	3560	I'm feeling like a damn sandwich here, y'all.
3560	7880	I am the meat that is between the good numbers six and nine,
7880	10600	the bridge between the celestial numerals
10600	13320	that make us all feel so nice.
13320	16560	That's right, y'all, this is episode 78.
16560	20680	And I'm building a bridge of vocal vibrations
20680	25000	live from 694.2 PTBP.
25000	28040	The numbers always tell the truth,
28080	31000	especially when they are the good numbers,
31000	32500	the nice numbers.
32500	35800	Speaking of numbers, we got one special message
35800	38600	from one very special listener.
38600	41000	This week's Howler with Wolf is from Zach,
41000	42640	who tagged that pretending pod
42640	45080	on his Instagram story for once.
45080	45960	He writes,
45960	49880	Hey Wolf, long time listener, first time Howler.
49880	50880	Howler howls.
55880	56760	Did you do it?
56760	57920	Did you howl?
58920	62360	Okay, now I want to hear you do a real long howl.
62360	64160	And it starts real confident,
64160	67400	like you're the only wolf in the whole dumpster.
67400	69280	But then as the howl goes on,
69280	72180	you become less and less sure of yourself.
72180	75040	Like you're stoned and underdressed at a wedding
75040	78600	that you weren't invited to until like the week before
78600	81140	when you ran into your old friend's fiance
81140	82360	at the coffee shop.
82360	84580	And she invited you after acting
84580	86360	like it was a total accident.
86360	89360	You were left off the guest list in the first place.
89360	91200	Now, do that now.
91200	92880	Okay, thanks, love you, bye.
92880	96840	P.S. Hey Joe, Justin, Luke, and Thomas,
96840	100680	I think y'all pretty funny and nice and cute to boot.
100680	103100	Now listen here, Zachary.
103100	106560	I do not howl on command for any man,
106560	109520	except for beautiful trash beings
109520	112760	who wish to roll in the filth with me, you dig?
112760	115280	I've also never been invited to a wedding,
115280	116840	but that has never stopped me
116840	119280	from enjoying myself to the fullest.
119280	124160	Full of love, full of trash, forever and evermore.
124160	127480	That sounds like holy matrimony to me, y'all.
127480	129400	Emphasis on the moan.
129400	130960	I love you too, Zach.
130960	133360	And one day I will eat your soul,
133360	137320	but before I do, I'll give you a little forehead kiss.
137320	139920	Stop it, stop what you're doing right now.
139920	142360	Pull over the car, dry off those hands,
142360	144840	and put down the damn quesadilla.
144840	147400	Go to Twitter, search at pretending pod.
147400	150000	Go to Instagram, search at pretending pod.
150000	152000	It's literally the exact same thing
152000	154160	that Jesus told his bro-mies.
154160	157280	Put down the quesadilla and follow me.
157280	159360	Or keep just listening, I guess,
159360	161880	but don't disappoint ol' Wolfie like that.
161880	164720	Tell your online friends about the show
164720	167160	and tag at pretending pod.
167160	168920	In terms of perspective,
168920	170960	let's try to look at this from Drew's.
170960	172560	It's time for the news.
172560	174600	Drew drove to the city in the midst
174600	176880	of a reconstruction of contention
176880	179000	that implemented puddle teaming,
179000	181880	the act of placing small man-made pools
181880	183720	filled with fish around town.
183720	186800	Drew admitted he didn't come up with this plan.
186800	189000	Rather, it was Pastor Adam Kane
189000	192240	who has seemingly assumed control of contention.
192240	193840	Drew went on to say the pastor
193840	196600	was using fish to collect the ooze.
196600	199880	Drew chastised the officers for leaving contention
199920	203120	during this phenomenally strange and harrowing time,
203120	205320	but John Lee Pettymore the 3rd
205320	208560	saw a vision of Drew bringing the radio, helmet,
208560	210320	and briefcase full of money
210320	212320	to the First Church of Contention,
212320	216040	and he freaked out on Drew for turning on his coworkers
216040	219800	until Drew showed them a round scar on his belly
219800	222120	from where he had been tortured.
222120	223880	When they patted down Drew,
223880	226480	they found a bloody piece of cheap carpet.
226480	228600	Drew told them, deadpan,
228600	231280	that choking on the carpet until he almost died
231280	232800	was how he found them.
232800	233960	It didn't take long
233960	236440	for the former contingent police officers
236440	237920	to torture Drew as well,
237920	239680	asking him to prove his assertion
239680	242560	by telling them where Tildy B. Mitchell is.
242560	246360	He said he saw only a small dark prison in his vision.
246360	249840	John went batshit and tried to pull off his own head.
249840	251680	Clark chased after him,
251680	255080	and Tyler, Kerry Page's energetic black lab,
255120	258240	came bounding toward the group from behind a barn,
258240	261120	taking us now to Clark's oldest loose end.
261120	264840	Honk if you know this, Wolf's boldest goose friend.
264840	268080	It's a brand new hit, a lone crack tone.
268080	271280	It's kazoo with no backbone.
271280	272200	Here we go.
302160	303600	Oh, yeah, it's a new episode.
303600	304440	Yeah, it's a new episode.
304440	306160	We have to record a new episode now.
307240	308920	Oh, behind the scenes.
310160	312740	Everybody listening out there.
312740	314720	It hasn't been a whole week
314720	316940	since we recorded the last episode.
318160	319120	Nope.
319120	320040	What have you guys been up to
320040	321760	since we recorded the last episode?
321760	323180	It feels like it's been a week.
323180	325180	I've been reading drill tweets.
325180	327680	I took a stroll over the restroom over there
327680	329040	and came back.
329040	330400	It was a good jaunt.
330400	331280	I've just been on Reddit.
331280	333040	I opened up another bubbly.
333040	333880	What flavor?
333880	336320	It's aha, it's strawberry cucumber.
336320	337240	Who makes aha?
337240	338320	Who makes aha?
338320	339160	I don't care.
339160	339980	What do you have, Joe?
341080	344460	I bought cranberry raspberry flavored La Croix.
344460	345920	I haven't tried it yet, though,
345920	347680	but I hadn't seen that flavor before.
347680	348760	I haven't seen that either.
348760	350200	Yeah, cran-raz.
350200	352840	Just so you know, it's the Coca-Cola company.
352840	354280	Hey, will you crack one right now?
354280	357160	I could've sworn that the package said cran-raz,
357160	359800	but this says razz cranberry.
360040	362400	It did a reverse of the thing.
362400	363240	I don't know why.
363240	364480	Here we go.
364480	365600	Oh!
365600	366760	Ooh, that's a crisp one
366760	368040	ripping the head off of that bad boy.
368040	369480	Oh, it's foaming everywhere.
369480	373000	Oh my God, Joe is just pouring it all over his forehead
373000	376160	while he shakes his golden locks back and forth.
376160	377000	Wow.
379180	380020	It's good.
380020	381800	And welcome to episode 78
381800	385320	here at Pretending To Be People.
385320	387480	You guys have had a week to think on what happened
387480	388440	in the last episode.
389000	390880	Any thoughts pop up?
390880	393080	I'm worried that you're gonna make me play Tyler
393080	395280	and Clark at the same time.
395280	397040	So I've been preparing.
397040	400160	I've been going in and out of character as fast as I can.
400160	401160	Can we see some of that?
401160	402000	No.
405400	406440	Just a little taste.
407280	409240	It's good to see the Contingent Boys.
409240	411120	Good to see you too, Tyler.
414480	415880	See, I've been practicing.
415880	416720	It's flawless, right?
416720	419360	Contrast really makes Clark Bishop's voice.
420440	421480	John Wayne-y?
423640	424640	Wayne-y.
424640	425960	Didn't we just leave the city?
425960	427400	How did Tyler get up here?
427400	430360	We pulled over, I think, outside Contingent.
430360	431680	It was like a dirt road, right?
431680	433800	Yeah, you guys were like halfway there, maybe.
433800	435480	He did make some distance though, it sounds like.
435480	437720	Yeah, what, like 30 miles?
437720	440520	When we did our Contingent Critter Coalition,
440520	442120	was that the date?
442120	443960	What date did that take place on?
443960	445000	Do you remember?
445000	446460	I think it was December 5th.
446500	448060	What day is it today?
448060	449820	I think it's December 6th.
449820	451940	Well, Luke, it's been a whole week since the last episode.
451940	453700	What have you thought about in the past week
453700	457820	about what is happening and what you should do on this one?
457820	458940	You know, not much.
461740	464540	Probably be more mean to Drew.
464540	467860	Were you mean to Drew back in the day, five days ago?
467860	469140	Not really, no.
469140	470580	I wasn't trying to be mean to him,
470580	472660	I was just more interested in the case than his whole being.
472660	476340	Yeah, you've seen a lot of misery and despair at this point.
476340	478620	Misery signals.
478620	481780	Okie doke, I'm ready to make shit up as I go.
482660	486260	Alrighty, well you guys are in the misery business,
486260	489700	so let's open up shop.
489700	491160	Tyler!
491160	493780	Is that Tyler?
493780	495620	That's Karen Page's dog, that's, guys,
495620	497800	that's the dog I was supposed to find.
497800	499340	That's it, it's right there.
499340	500920	I pat Clark in the back and says,
500920	502380	looks like you found him.
502380	504700	Mission accomplished, we can go home now.
504700	507060	Hey Drew, how do you know who Tyler is?
507060	510540	You all can see Drew Andrews
510540	515540	just filled brimming with affection.
515820	518620	Well, Tyler's just the greatest dog in the world
518620	521420	and I could've sworn that he'd been eaten by homeless people
521420	526420	but, I mean, he's Councilman Kerry Page's dog, right?
526580	528300	Drew, that's correct, it's weird though
528300	531500	because she floated the same homeless thing
531500	532420	that you just said.
532420	535580	Oh yeah, I guess I remember you telling me about that.
535580	538100	I'm confused though, how did you know this dog was Tyler?
538100	542660	John, I mean, I did put signs all over the neighborhood.
542660	544980	He probably saw it on the copier or something.
544980	547320	It just seems like you know this dog.
547320	548540	Is that accurate, Drew?
548540	552580	Well, yeah, it's like Clark said,
552580	554980	I saw the pictures on the copier.
554980	556420	Humant!
556420	557820	Okay, everybody roll humant.
557860	558700	Yeah.
562380	563220	Pass.
563220	564340	Ah, 11.
564340	566460	62 on 80.
566460	570300	I fail a 78 on a 30.
570300	571740	Okay, I'm gonna kick you out, Drew.
571740	572580	Okay.
578580	580040	Hey, Luke and Thomas.
580040	580880	Yo.
580880	581700	Zach.
581700	583260	Thomas, John Lee Pettymore especially,
583260	586140	when you hear Drew talking about Tyler,
586860	589660	it's not Drew, that's not Drew talking about Tyler.
589660	592380	It's not his voice, it's not his cadence.
592380	593620	I mean, it is his voice,
593620	596820	but it's not his personality that's coming through.
596820	598300	Damn it, didn't I spend 10 luck
598300	600900	to try to figure out if this was Drew or not?
602100	606460	Yeah, well, I guess actually it was more so
606460	610560	like you asked if you could trust Drew
610560	615060	and I answered that question more so
615100	619380	instead of like, is it Drew as a question?
619380	620980	Whatever, I made my choice.
622200	624500	Okay, let's get Joe back in here.
631040	634480	Drew, Drew, you seem awfully fond of a dog
634480	637160	that you saw on a poster.
637160	638060	He's probably just happy
638060	640180	that I'm able to close my case, guys.
640180	643220	Yes, yeah, it's definitely that I'm happy for Clark Bishop
643220	646420	because he was really worried about not finding that dog
646420	650480	because Councilwoman Carrie Pages is a very respected person
650480	653180	in the contention community.
653180	655300	Thank you not to interrupt me right now, please.
655300	658140	Drew, you would not have known that that was Tyler
658140	661100	based off a black and white picture from a poster.
661100	665740	That could be any dog, this doesn't add up.
665740	668140	Well, it's a black lab and it's a black and white picture.
668140	670020	I feel like that doesn't discredit it.
670020	672420	It's less that you recognize the dog
672460	675900	and it's more that you seem to know about this dog
675900	677140	that you've never met.
677140	678860	You seem to have genuine affection
678860	681580	for a dog you've only seen on a poster.
681580	683180	Well, Councilwoman Carrie Pages
683180	685260	is an excellent member of our community
685260	688020	and the fact that she has a dog means that that dog
688020	689580	must be one of the greatest dogs
689580	692020	that could be around for sure.
692020	692840	Hey, Carrie.
692840	693680	Yeah, what?
696100	699580	And as Keith Vigna says, Carrie and Drew says,
699580	702800	what, Clark Bishop's eyes widen.
704300	705980	I need everybody to roll sanity.
707140	707980	What?
707980	709820	Fail, but not over my power.
711300	712780	Fail, not over my power.
712780	714740	I also fail, but not over my power.
714740	719740	Everybody lose one sanity as Tyler runs up to Drew Andrews.
721420	723120	I believe still in handcuffs.
723120	724900	Oh yeah, he's still in handcuffs.
724900	729180	Drew gets down on his knees and starts like nuzzling
729780	733820	as Tyler runs right up and begins kissing
733820	736140	and licking all over Drew Andrews.
736140	739940	Drew, Tyler really does know you pretty well.
740940	742180	This ain't Drew, Clark.
742180	744260	They called, yeah, you, what?
744260	746460	Councilwoman Pages, how the hell did you get
746460	747760	in the body of our associate?
747760	749800	Clark's eyes widen even further.
751020	752580	What, what?
752580	755440	I am simply here to bring back the three of you
755440	758360	to contention and I didn't think that this was gonna be
758400	759360	that much of an issue.
759360	761360	Jesus, it's like with you people
761360	763280	and I'm just glad that Tyler is here.
763280	766020	If you would, if you would just come back,
766020	767920	I think we could do a lot of good together.
767920	770660	It's just that we needed your help
770660	773800	and we didn't know exactly how to get it
773800	778800	and so we just need, we figured Drew might be the best way
780120	781540	to get you guys to come back.
781540	782760	I don't know about these guys,
782760	786300	but I don't take very kindly to tricks being played on me.
786300	787440	I'm sorry.
787520	789500	Yeah, what do you guys think?
789500	790340	I don't like it.
790340	792200	Clark looks like he's trying to do
792200	793900	a lot of math in his head.
793900	795400	How did you get switched?
795400	797280	Yeah, how did you become Drew?
798280	799520	The radio.
799520	801440	Right, that makes sense.
801440	803960	Where's Drew then?
803960	804800	Is he okay?
804800	808520	You see a flicker in Drew's eyes.
808520	810800	If you ever wanna see Drew Andrews again,
810800	812920	you're gonna come back to contention with me.
812920	817420	So you tortured poor Drew and he wouldn't flip on us.
818260	821060	So you had to switch his body with yours?
821060	822020	Is that what happened?
822020	823580	He shrugs his shoulders.
823580	825300	I poke the wound.
825300	827500	Yeah, I was gonna say I punch him in the gut
827500	828500	where that wound was.
828500	830500	Poke and punch, same time.
830500	831340	No, God.
833420	836260	Please, please don't hurt me.
836260	838180	Please don't hurt me, I'll do it.
838180	841200	I'll even act like you guys don't even know Drew anymore.
841200	842280	I didn't think about this.
842280	843820	There's three of you, there's only one of me.
843820	845420	Please just don't hurt Tyler
845420	847060	and we could all go back to contention
847700	848660	and I can help you, I can help you.
848660	849660	I can help you, thank you.
849660	852800	Council woman, first of all, we're not gonna hurt Tyler,
852800	855260	but we might take him away from you forever.
855260	856380	Well, that would be hurting him
856380	857980	because we're so connected.
857980	858820	I don't know.
858820	860700	I think he'd be real happy
860700	862980	after we fed him steaks for a few days.
862980	863820	You wouldn't.
863820	865500	He might forget all about you.
865500	866420	Drew starts crying.
866420	868140	Council woman, now,
868140	870380	why don't you tell us what the preacher wants?
870380	872740	I already told you, we're just trying to help.
873900	874740	Can I humid that?
874740	875580	No.
875580	876400	All right, go ahead and roll.
876560	877400	Keith.
877400	879920	64 on 80.
879920	884100	Well, okay, so he's trying to collect all the residue, right?
884100	886880	So that there's no more out in contention
886880	889600	so that we can pull away all the puddles
889600	892400	and we can open up contention again.
892400	895000	You think he just wants to collect the residue
895000	896920	and then do nothing with it?
896920	899400	How can he keep it safe, contained?
899400	901040	I'm not in charge of that.
901040	902640	I think we gotta go talk to this guy.
902640	904200	You never stopped to think, did you?
904200	906160	Drew, I mean, Carrie?
906800	908040	Drew, Carrie?
908040	908880	Drew, Drew, Drew.
908880	909700	Drew, Drew, Drew.
909700	910540	Drew, Drew, Drew.
910540	911380	Drew, Drew, Drew.
911380	912220	Drew, Drew, Drew.
912220	913960	I was trying not to laugh.
913960	915500	Welcome to pretending to be people
915500	918340	where everything is made up and the roles don't matter.
918340	923340	You got put into the body of Drew
924480	927640	with a radio that had tubes on it
927640	931320	by, I assume, Pastor Adam Kane.
931320	934840	Was this all just like a Tuesday afternoon for you?
934840	936440	How did you react to all the...
936440	939560	Are you aware of the world around you
939560	940760	that you've now entered?
941820	943960	Oh, I think she's aware, Clark.
943960	946480	You've been with the pastor for quite a while, haven't you?
946480	948660	Well, when you guys weren't doing anything,
948660	950520	we decided that we needed to team up
950520	952920	to make change happen, something substantial
952920	956080	that could actually take care of business in this time.
956080	957880	I don't like this excuse.
957880	960100	I don't like that line of reasoning at all.
960100	962120	Carrie, walk me through the day
962120	964120	that Pastor Adam Kane said to you,
964240	967440	I need you to switch bodies with this guy here
967440	968520	using this radio.
968520	969360	How did that set with you?
969360	970480	That was just earlier today,
970480	973520	and honestly, I'm pretty heads in at that point,
973520	975880	so I don't know if you've noticed,
975880	977960	but the world is different now,
977960	981480	and you either adapt or you die.
981480	982400	Oh, we know.
982400	985040	I lean in and whisper,
985040	988440	is this because I couldn't find your dog soon enough?
988440	990160	Is this because of me?
990200	994520	Clark, I have no ill will against you
994520	996080	now that my dog is back.
996080	997900	All right, so how about this?
997900	999640	What if we, you know,
1000660	1002480	we're gonna send Tyler away,
1002480	1004520	somewhere where you can never find him
1004520	1005640	and you'll never see him again.
1005640	1006720	Now, we're not gonna hurt him,
1006720	1011160	but yeah, unless you become a mole for us.
1011160	1013280	That's what I said I would do.
1013280	1014920	Yes, we're on the same page.
1014920	1016260	Well, I know. It was your idea.
1016260	1017520	It was your idea. Okay, I love it.
1017520	1018720	It can be your idea too.
1018760	1019680	I just want you to know
1019680	1022480	that that's the leverage we have against you,
1022480	1024680	is that you won't ever see your dog again.
1024680	1029680	This brief reunion will be merely a painful moment in time
1030280	1032600	in which you get to see what might've been.
1032600	1034020	Drew and Tyler have their heads,
1034020	1037280	their foreheads pressed right up against each other.
1037280	1042200	Drew kind of like does one final push into Tyler's forehead
1042200	1044360	and then leans back and looks you dead in the eyes
1044360	1047200	and is like, I will do anything to be,
1047200	1049200	I will do anything to keep Tyler safe.
1049200	1050320	That's what I like to hear.
1050320	1052400	Boys, I think we ought to head back to contention.
1052400	1055760	It sounds like there's even more trouble brewing down there.
1055760	1057960	Oh, hey, why don't you tell us how you got this car?
1057960	1059320	We know it's not yours.
1059320	1062160	It was in the police department parking lot.
1062160	1063960	Yeah, old Trent left it there.
1063960	1066000	I think Grand Theft Auto is,
1066000	1067640	or tampering with a motor vehicle
1067640	1069840	is the least of our concern right now.
1069840	1073300	I'm gonna put Drew Carey in the back of the car,
1073660	1077580	get back in the passenger seat and look at the guys.
1077580	1078420	Who's driving?
1078420	1079580	Let's put her in the trunk
1079580	1081040	and put the dog in the front seat.
1081040	1081880	Okay.
1083620	1084440	I love that.
1084440	1085280	I'll drive.
1085280	1086740	Are you keeping Drew tied up?
1086740	1087980	Are you keeping him handcuffed?
1087980	1088820	Yes.
1088820	1089780	And are you doing anything with his legs?
1089780	1090700	Leg cuffed.
1090700	1091540	Yep.
1091540	1092360	Oh, damn.
1092360	1094540	It seems like that might cause more trouble than it helps.
1094540	1097020	He's gonna be able to be mobile when we get places.
1097020	1098520	Yeah, when we get places.
1098520	1100500	We're driving back, we're halfway to contention.
1100500	1103100	You afraid he's gonna walk out of the trunk?
1103740	1104580	If he's got his legs,
1104580	1105860	he might be able to kick his way out.
1105860	1107620	But if we leg cuff him,
1107620	1110500	then all he can do is wiggle like an ineffective worm
1110500	1111340	back there.
1111340	1115100	Handcuffs with attached ankle cuffs
1115100	1117380	were pretty common in the 70s.
1117380	1121060	So that's what Clark has on his old school
1121060	1122980	contention police officer uniform.
1126980	1127820	I got these here.
1127820	1129420	I'm imagining handcuffs on his wrist,
1129420	1130500	handcuffs on his ankles,
1130500	1133260	and then two handcuffs connecting those handcuffs
1133260	1135780	like behind his back like a hog tied.
1135780	1136620	Yeah.
1139080	1140500	Rigged and ready to go.
1140500	1142660	Boys, can we go to my hotel?
1142660	1144580	There's something I really need to show you.
1144580	1145660	Yeah, we're driving now.
1145660	1147800	We're in charge of our own destinies.
1147800	1149380	Of course we can do that.
1149380	1151580	Do you guys have any other plans?
1151580	1153780	We're gonna have to deal with the pastor at some point,
1153780	1156420	but I've been meaning to get back
1156420	1158400	and show you guys this for a minute.
1159040	1160380	Let's just do it.
1161480	1164500	Yeah, that's fine, sure.
1164500	1166280	And I gotta let Bean out.
1166280	1168040	He's probably ripped up the carpet
1168040	1169360	or peed and pooped in there.
1169360	1171060	I don't know if he even has food left.
1171060	1172360	We should probably give your dog
1172360	1173760	to someone who's gonna take care of it.
1173760	1175900	Him and Tyler can go to a farm.
1175900	1177260	Not really though, I love Bean.
1177260	1179220	All right, let's go to contention.
1182500	1184000	The highway between the city
1184000	1186080	and the small town of contention,
1186080	1188200	if it truly can be called a highway,
1188840	1189680	the part nearest to contention
1189680	1192580	hasn't seen road repair in decades.
1192580	1196160	Those from contention know to forfeit the radio
1196160	1197780	during certain stretches of road
1197780	1201280	because the rough old concrete is so loud,
1201280	1203720	the damage to the speakers as well as to your ears
1203720	1205560	is never worth it.
1205560	1207480	That's just something you're all used to.
1207480	1211160	What you're not used to is a blockade
1211160	1216160	made of splintered church pews stopping you from exiting
1216720	1221720	and the sign from Subtropolis torn down and spray painted.
1222760	1225560	It's like leaning up against this blockade,
1225560	1227920	has a big arrow to the right and says,
1227920	1230480	detour, please keep right.
1230480	1234620	I need you all to roll alertness or search,
1234620	1236760	whichever's higher or Thomas, you can roll drive
1236760	1238600	if that one's higher in order to see this
1238600	1239680	in time to do anything about it.
1239680	1241880	I slow down and I wanna say that
1241880	1243300	I feel like this is a trap.
1245100	1245940	I fail.
1246580	1247620	I rolled a six on a 60.
1247620	1249460	I rolled a 35 on a 70 drive.
1249460	1253760	So I just, I slow to a stop before we have to turn off
1253760	1255920	and I say something doesn't feel right.
1255920	1258060	I think we're about to get children of mend.
1258060	1262520	In the distance, you see that the detour leads down
1262520	1266600	some crunchy December grass and onto the service road,
1266600	1270780	just to the right, just to the north of the exit ramp.
1270780	1273440	But there is certainly some sort of situation
1273440	1275300	set up on this service road.
1275340	1279980	A crane sits off to the side of this makeshift entrance
1279980	1280960	to contention.
1280960	1284460	It's boom and jib hanging over the middle of the road
1284460	1286680	where its payload sits.
1286680	1291600	A substitute gate made of those big ass construction tubes.
1291600	1294800	So basically the crane is there to let cars into contention
1294800	1298360	by lifting all these tubes.
1298360	1300800	Like sauna tubes, the kind of things you fill with concrete?
1300800	1302600	No, the big concrete.
1302600	1304360	Big plastic tubes.
1304380	1306100	If we were in the matrix and we shot them,
1306100	1307900	they would go rolling across the road
1307900	1310260	and cars would crash into them.
1310260	1311100	Gotcha.
1311100	1313140	But the highway itself is clear.
1313140	1315400	It's just the exit ramp that has all this construction
1315400	1316240	going on, right?
1316240	1318320	So we could keep going down the highway unobstructed,
1318320	1320320	come around maybe the backside or something like that.
1320320	1322100	So yeah, we just keep driving.
1322100	1323080	Fuck the detour.
1323080	1325500	We look for a back way into town.
1325500	1326340	Yeah.
1326340	1328300	Or at least one that doesn't have a giant crane in the way.
1328300	1329260	Sure, sure, sure, sure.
1329260	1330460	If this is the main entrance,
1330460	1332100	then it stands to reason that the others
1332120	1335040	are probably less secure than this.
1335040	1336400	That's what I'm hoping at least, yeah.
1336400	1337240	It's worth scouting.
1337240	1339780	Plus we're the cops and unless the pastor
1339780	1342300	has explicitly said to not let us in.
1342300	1344400	We know this town doesn't feel too kindly
1344400	1345280	about us right now.
1345280	1348880	I think we're the cops is about the worst thing
1348880	1352160	that could come out of anyone's mouth trying to get in.
1352160	1354660	Like why the fuck did you leave?
1354660	1357300	Why aren't you here in the first place?
1357300	1358520	But doesn't it kind of sound like
1358520	1361480	Pastor Adam Cain's running the show now and he wants us?
1361700	1363660	If we could not alert him to our presence,
1363660	1364900	that'd be the best for now.
1364900	1366020	I agree 100%.
1366020	1369020	I'm just saying I think if push came to shove,
1369020	1371100	we could probably get through this barrier.
1371100	1375580	Let's try to find another way around and get to my hotel.
1375580	1378780	So if you could all pull up the map real quick.
1378780	1379900	Yeah, I've got the map.
1379900	1383820	I want you to see essentially why Hotel Motel
1383820	1386300	might be one of the harder places to get into.
1386300	1387860	I see what you mean.
1387860	1389580	Yeah, it's right by the exit.
1389600	1391620	We don't have to drive anywhere.
1391620	1394240	Let's just pull, let's go back down the highway
1394240	1395920	the way we came a little bit,
1395920	1397160	pull off the side of the road
1397160	1399880	and then just walk to the Hotel Motel.
1399880	1401080	Yeah, that works.
1401080	1403160	Are you leaving Tyler in the car?
1403160	1405060	No, we're leaving Drew Carey in the trunk,
1405060	1406600	but we're taking Tyler with us.
1406600	1409760	You don't think we should take Drew Carey with us?
1409760	1411480	We hogtied him pretty good.
1411480	1412880	Wasn't our whole conversation though,
1412880	1417880	was that she was gonna be on our side and help us now
1418880	1420980	because we threatened her dog.
1420980	1423620	But I don't know, I mean,
1423620	1426320	it just seems like she's more of a liability
1426320	1428220	while we run a dude Drew's thing real quick.
1428220	1429060	You mean Keith's thing?
1429060	1431780	Yeah, it feels like the safest place for her to be
1431780	1432820	would be in this trunk.
1432820	1435540	I'm just saying we're not gonna be at the hotel for long.
1435540	1437340	Yeah, we're just missing in and out.
1437340	1438900	I just gotta get something.
1438900	1439740	Okay, yeah.
1439740	1442620	You can, somebody can stay here and guard,
1442620	1447620	guard him, them if you want, but I don't know.
1448500	1450900	Let's just all go and make it real quick
1450900	1452340	and get back to the car.
1452340	1453300	Here's my only fear,
1453300	1455060	is that things don't seem to go well for us.
1455060	1459380	So what if Drew Carey's trapped in the trunk for a while?
1459380	1462800	Well, that's her own fault for becoming, you know,
1462800	1466580	a pawn of this evil goo like a collecting pastor.
1466580	1469300	But we also were just saying that she could be helpful.
1469300	1470960	Like, are we abandoning the idea
1470960	1472700	that that could be helpful to us?
1472700	1475220	Right now, I think she's the most helpful in that trunk.
1475220	1477420	If she feels like she's in a situation
1477960	1479320	where we're leading her,
1479320	1481000	trying to be stealthy to the hotel,
1481000	1482100	and she can just scream like,
1482100	1483880	hey, hey, they're here,
1483880	1486160	and sick a bunch of people on us.
1486160	1487000	True.
1487000	1487820	That's true.
1487820	1489040	True, true.
1489040	1489880	Okay.
1489880	1490700	All right, that's it.
1490700	1491540	Let's go.
1491540	1496120	Let's go to the hotel on foot with Tyler, right?
1496120	1497040	We're bringing Tyler with us?
1497040	1497880	Yeah.
1497880	1498700	Yeah.
1498700	1500080	Clark goes around to the trunk and pats on it.
1500080	1500920	We'll be right back.
1500920	1503000	We're taking Tyler, so don't get any funny ideas
1503000	1504240	about getting out of there.
1504240	1505720	Wait, where are you going right now?
1505720	1506540	Please, thank you.
1506560	1507720	Tell me, please.
1507720	1508560	Nope, nope.
1508560	1509380	We don't want you,
1509380	1512000	if any of your friends come along and find this truck,
1512000	1513840	we don't want you leading them to us,
1513840	1517860	so we'll be back within 15 minutes, half an hour,
1517860	1519160	and you just sit tight.
1519160	1521960	Clark's gonna be staying here with you,
1521960	1523280	and then I wink at them.
1523280	1525800	And I'm putting some headphones in,
1525800	1527920	and I'm just gonna sit silently to myself
1527920	1528760	in the front seat up there.
1528760	1530520	Yeah, he's listening to an audio book,
1530520	1532360	so you don't disturb him or anything,
1532360	1534120	or he won't be able to enjoy that.
1537240	1538080	Great job.
1538080	1539040	That's exactly right.
1539040	1540120	You just don't say nothing.
1540120	1541400	All right, let's go, boys.
1541400	1542240	Boy.
1542240	1544440	I meant Keith and Tyler.
1544440	1549440	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
1549920	1552360	And then we all head off to the hotel motel.
1552360	1553660	Is there anything in the car we can use
1553660	1555920	to make a makeshift leash for Tyler?
1555920	1557480	Oh, for sure, seat belt.
1557480	1559040	There's a light cardigan in the back,
1559040	1562260	and I tie that around his collar.
1562260	1563480	One sleeve tied around the collar,
1563480	1565360	the other sleeve I'm holding on to.
1565360	1566200	Okay.
1566780	1567620	Cardigan leash.
1567620	1568660	Cardigan leash.
1568660	1569500	I love it.
1569500	1571820	All right, Keith, you know,
1571820	1573540	I probably should have humanted you
1573540	1575940	or done something to make sure
1575940	1578500	that your motives were good and leaning us
1578500	1581860	away from our main goals back to your hotel room.
1581860	1584900	But I didn't, so let's just get this over with.
1584900	1586860	Okey-dokey, who's got the worst stealth?
1586860	1588060	Mine's 50.
1588060	1589100	Mine's 10.
1589100	1590380	Oh my God.
1590380	1591220	Why?
1591220	1592520	I've got 30.
1592520	1596100	Okay, so I'm gonna have John and Clark roll
1596880	1599520	if you guys succeed, you'll be able to assist
1599520	1603680	by giving a plus 20 each on a success to Keith.
1603680	1604520	10.
1606000	1608400	So that is a plus 20 to Keith's 10.
1608400	1609520	I failed, a 40.
1609520	1611720	All right, Keith, you're gonna roll under 30.
1613900	1614740	83.
1620020	1622600	Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, John Lee,
1622700	1625380	Pettymore the 3rd, and Tyler
1626860	1631660	are walking across the highway.
1631660	1635700	I need everybody to roll alertness.
1639500	1641140	32 on a 60.
1641140	1642500	90 on a 60.
1642500	1644380	87 on a 70.
1644380	1649380	All righty, just got Thomas here.
1653840	1656280	Thomas, you see across the highway
1656280	1658360	when you're like on the highway itself,
1658360	1660280	it's the highest point that you've been at.
1660280	1664160	And looking across the town of contention,
1664160	1666800	there's not much of a skyline in contention, right?
1666800	1669020	Not too many tall buildings here,
1669020	1673760	but you do notice that surrounding what you know
1674060	1676740	as the campus of First Church of Contention,
1676740	1680180	there is, that doesn't look right, it can't,
1680180	1682220	it's moving, it's a wall.
1682220	1684700	You imagine this is what it looked like
1684700	1688260	if Moses actually had parted the Red Sea,
1688260	1692900	as you see a moat in the air that is surrounding
1692900	1695960	the campus of the First Church of Contention.
1695960	1699780	And in the water are many different kinds of fish
1699780	1702140	that are all swimming about.
1702160	1703520	I need you to roll sanity.
1704840	1706120	Ooh, fail.
1706120	1708600	Lose one sanity as you realize
1708600	1710200	what you are going up against.
1710200	1713520	This is the kind of unnatural
1713520	1717080	that you have not witnessed something this controlled,
1717080	1719080	right, like everything that you've seen
1719080	1722940	has been just haphazard, seemingly chaotic.
1722940	1727240	But this, this was formed and this is held.
1728580	1730360	This is scary.
1730380	1732340	That's what you're supposed to do in horror, right?
1732340	1734420	Is you say, this is scary.
1734420	1736260	This is scary.
1736260	1737380	You're scared now.
1738620	1741900	Do you feel it inside of you where you're scared?
1741900	1742740	Oh yeah.
1744580	1747060	All right, I'm gonna, did you roll over your power?
1747060	1747940	No.
1747940	1749580	Okay, I'm gonna bring them back.
1755980	1757140	Sorry, I forgot to tell you guys
1757140	1759020	I was putting you in the waiting room.
1759920	1764920	Well, and they should have just been there because.
1765560	1766560	Yeah, immediately.
1766560	1771480	Yeah, I stop at my track and I tap you on the shoulders
1771480	1773760	and point to the first church of contention
1773760	1776320	and I say, hey guys, take a look
1776320	1778040	at what's going on around the church.
1778040	1779640	Both of you roll sanity for me.
1779640	1780720	For looking at the church?
1780720	1782120	Yep.
1782120	1782960	I fail.
1785960	1786780	I fail.
1786780	1788880	Do you fail over your power either one of you?
1789700	1790540	No.
1790540	1792820	So you each lose one sanity.
1792820	1794340	How close to the church are we?
1794340	1797220	Quite a ways from the church.
1797220	1799180	Okay, I see it on the map now.
1799180	1801020	I mean 20 blocks maybe?
1801020	1801840	Yeah.
1801840	1803220	Or like five.
1804220	1806140	Oh yeah, like five blocks, sorry.
1806140	1809100	Above the skyline of contention,
1809100	1811020	which is basically non-existent,
1811020	1814320	I think the highest thing in the town previous to this
1814320	1817180	was probably the church's cross
1817200	1819480	on top of their steeple.
1819480	1824480	Currently above that, you see a massive wall of water
1826800	1831560	that is surrounding the entire land that the church sits on
1831560	1836560	and it is exactly like what you think it might look like
1836840	1841840	if you made a wall out of water.
1841840	1842680	Yeah, exactly.
1842680	1843640	It's exactly what it would look like
1843640	1844880	if you made a wall out of water
1844880	1846760	and there are fish swimming all through it
1847540	1850820	it's cool some of them literally jump out of the water
1850820	1854380	and then gravity pulls them back in sideways
1854380	1856580	into the wall of water.
1856580	1860420	And oh, I forgot to mention, it's scary.
1863660	1867140	You've never seen this kind of unnatural power
1867140	1869100	controlled like this.
1869100	1872820	It seems to not be chaotic, it is purposeful.
1872820	1874580	Clark starts walking toward it.
1874600	1877100	Clark, what are you doing?
1877100	1879400	You didn't, did you see all that?
1879400	1883720	There's fish in there, they're just flopping around.
1883720	1886120	Look at that, I gotta see this thing.
1886120	1889960	Yeah, I mean, let's just swing by the hotel real quick
1889960	1892040	and then we can go there.
1892040	1894560	Yeah, Clark, that's kind of where all our,
1894560	1897080	seemingly all our enemies are.
1897080	1900020	I mean, except our human enemies,
1900020	1901800	the ooze is its own thing.
1901820	1903460	Yeah, see, Tyler agrees.
1903460	1905820	We should just go run by the hotel real quick
1905820	1906660	and check things out.
1906660	1908740	But you're saying that we'll be able to get up there
1908740	1910020	close to it later on maybe.
1910020	1910860	Yeah, yeah.
1910860	1912380	See some of those fish.
1912380	1914540	Oh yeah, we'll take them fish.
1914540	1915920	That'd be neat as hell.
1915920	1916860	All right, yeah, let's go.
1916860	1919620	A regular ichthyologist is Clark Bishop.
1919620	1920460	You know it.
1920460	1921700	Pick the pace up a little bit
1921700	1924980	and start more than jogging towards the hotel.
1924980	1925820	Yeah, I follow.
1925820	1927980	As you guys get to hotel motel
1928000	1932120	you see that all the doors are open.
1932120	1935200	I sprint to my room and in the parking lot.
1935200	1937620	Look down here, it looks like a dog
1937620	1939020	tried to get into this room.
1940640	1943440	It looks like one burst from the inside outward
1943440	1944280	in this one here.
1944280	1946400	Yeah, can we reconstruct the series of events
1946400	1947240	that happened here?
1947240	1950160	It's several critters working together it seems.
1950160	1952160	It looks like a bird hit the window here.
1952160	1954820	Wow, this is something strange went on.
1954820	1957760	Maybe it's, do I see a cat around anywhere?
1958380	1960340	You guys are seeing that from a distance
1960340	1965140	and just wonderfully ignoring the scene
1965140	1968660	that's in the parking lot of hotel motel
1968660	1972700	which before you is, there's a dunking booth
1972700	1976580	filled with fish and sitting above the water
1976580	1981180	there's a young boy, a large boy with dumpling cheeks
1981180	1985580	and rounded ears that accentuate the roundness of his face
1985600	1988680	and he is slowly surveying the area
1988680	1993680	with a furrowed brow above glassy, darting eyes
1994000	1996720	while consistently stuffing his face
1996720	1999480	with a cheesy ziti scooped up
1999480	2001920	from a mixing bowl in his lap.
2004160	2006640	It seems like this husky fella is some kind of lookout.
2006640	2009200	They said they were using children and crazy folks
2009200	2011040	to look out for the ooze.
2011040	2012720	And see he's got his little tank of fish there
2012720	2014080	that he can just dump down into
2014940	2016060	in case it comes by.
2016060	2018080	Roll alertness for me, Thomas.
2020100	2020940	Seven.
2020940	2024500	And you notice alongside that astute observation
2024500	2028140	there is a walkie talkie that is mounted
2028140	2030700	on the netting of this dunk tank
2030700	2032620	so that it could be used
2032620	2034500	if someone was standing in the dunk tank.
2034500	2035340	Walkie talkie.
2035340	2037100	What's he, what's the kid wearing?
2037100	2038140	What is the kid wearing?
2038140	2039940	He is wearing.
2039940	2042300	I'm mostly asking, is he wearing like a swimsuit
2042300	2044020	so that he would be happy to be dunked
2044960	2047040	or is he just wearing civilian clothing?
2047040	2048920	No, he's just wearing normal clothes.
2048920	2050080	What'd you say, Thomas?
2050080	2052000	Said lack a week.
2052000	2055160	Like Meatwad and some awkward teen hunger force.
2055160	2056460	It's just a thing.
2056460	2057960	So what happens?
2059120	2060440	We tell you what happens.
2063320	2065640	Hey fellas, see that walkie talkie he's got there?
2065640	2066520	Yeah.
2066520	2069560	Seems like he could alert the church to our presence
2069560	2071760	so we might wanna, we might wanna duck down.
2071760	2073920	How are we gonna sneak around him?
2074780	2075620	Yeah, you could draw stealth.
2077900	2080060	Is anybody feeling particularly sneaky?
2080060	2082140	Is this a working carnival dunk tank?
2082140	2084980	Like does it have a target that we could hit
2084980	2086260	and dunk the kid?
2086260	2087940	Yeah, let's say that it does.
2087940	2090660	All right, can any of us throw?
2090660	2091640	We could shoot.
2093340	2094160	That's true.
2095300	2097380	I've got a 60 firearms, what do you got?
2097380	2099780	I'm feeling a little better than that.
2099780	2101820	All right, Keith, take the shot.
2101820	2103500	Well, I mean, what's your plan here?
2104040	2105920	If we dunk him, he's gonna say that he got dunked
2105920	2107160	and hurt a gunshot.
2107160	2109920	Right, but it gives us time and his confusion to run by.
2109920	2111940	He won't necessarily see what dunked him.
2111940	2112780	That's true.
2112780	2115280	And if you, you know, fuck up and hit the kid,
2115280	2117760	then we don't really have a problem either way, so.
2117760	2118600	That's true.
2120080	2123720	But as a, just throwing it out there,
2123720	2126720	another option is that we're here to get something
2126720	2127560	from Keith. Just shoot the kid
2127560	2129340	instead of fucking around with the dunk tank?
2129340	2130800	You're right, you're right.
2131780	2133260	Keith, why don't you,
2133260	2134980	you're not wearing a uniform or anything.
2134980	2137460	Why don't you walk up there, show him, I guess,
2137460	2138900	your hotel room key or whatever.
2138900	2140820	I mean, he's looking out for goo, right?
2140820	2143640	I mean, that's ostensibly what he's looking out for.
2143640	2146700	I could try to just obscure my face.
2146700	2149140	Give me. Is Keith clean-shaven?
2149140	2152700	Scraggly, but it's been a couple days since I shaved, so.
2152700	2155540	I grab a big thing of mud and I just rub it
2155540	2157860	all over your face where a beard would be.
2157860	2159620	I allow it to happen.
2159620	2162800	I have the mud beard on and I want to just quickly
2162800	2166160	walk over to my hotel room.
2166160	2169760	And if it helps, I do have some disguise points.
2169760	2172240	Clark, you, me, and the dog will hunker down here
2172240	2173920	and we'll see how Keith gets along.
2173920	2175680	If he gets into any trouble with this boy,
2175680	2178240	the boy's like, hey, that's Officer Vigna.
2178240	2179720	You know, we'll dunk him or shoot him
2179720	2181120	or do what we have to do.
2181120	2181960	Exactly.
2181960	2184820	We've taken care of kids before, so.
2184820	2189820	Uh, I didn't know that.
2190120	2192120	I thought you meant take care of him like we dunk him.
2192120	2195600	I'm not, I don't think I want to kill a kid today.
2195600	2197680	Like I said, whatever we have to do,
2197680	2199880	I'm just, I'm glad you're my partner in this
2199880	2201080	because we've been there before.
2201080	2202160	We've done through, we've, you know,
2202160	2205000	we've gone through this, so I know you'll do
2205000	2207440	what must be done when the time comes.
2207440	2209240	I didn't do it. I didn't do it last time.
2209240	2211880	It was a thing that happened that we were there for,
2211880	2213600	but I wasn't, like I would've,
2213600	2215180	I would've preferred it not to have happened,
2215180	2217460	but I, I'm with you.
2217460	2218300	We're here.
2218300	2220220	We're on the exact same page, buddy.
2221500	2223100	I know you're with me, killer.
2223100	2225900	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
2225900	2229300	Keith, roll a disguise.
2229300	2230540	There was a face of really happy
2230540	2232220	and then a face of maybe shock.
2232220	2234220	A 23 on a 30.
2235220	2237100	Yeah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
2237100	2240460	As you walk by, you see these very glassy,
2240460	2243380	very darting eyes of this total chub,
2244360	2248280	look you up and down and then immediately pay you no mind
2248280	2251040	as he continues to survey the land.
2251040	2254820	And you walk into a room that has been ransacked.
2254820	2256560	Bean is not here.
2256560	2257400	Shit.
2257400	2261000	And the window, as you all observed earlier,
2261000	2262240	has been busted out.
2262240	2264560	I immediately go directly to the safe.
2264560	2267540	So, hotel safes, motel safes.
2267540	2269520	I think you can just pick them up, right?
2269520	2270400	Some of them.
2270400	2271880	It depends, yep.
2271900	2274340	So, Luke, how much luck do you have?
2274340	2275160	35.
2277260	2278100	That sucks.
2278100	2281020	Go ahead and roll luck to see if your safe
2281020	2283340	is in hotel motel.
2283340	2284420	22.
2284420	2288840	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
2288840	2290260	And Bean is inside.
2292340	2294940	Whew, I was gonna be so disappointed.
2294940	2296940	I was too, honestly, I was gonna be pissed.
2296940	2297900	I was like, please roll.
2297900	2300620	Okay, crit, crit success, it is there.
2302420	2303820	Yeah, I'm trying to think of something
2303820	2304860	that would make it better.
2304860	2307880	Oh, you don't have to, you don't have to,
2307880	2310160	this kid is completely preoccupied
2310160	2311200	when you come out with it.
2311200	2313060	Like, he is. The safe?
2313060	2314660	I'm like, I don't need the whole safe.
2314660	2315780	Oh, right.
2315780	2317260	Oh, shit, yeah, that's what I was thinking.
2317260	2319980	I was like, okay, so Keith carries this safe out.
2319980	2321380	Fuck me, so.
2321380	2323140	Guys, look, the safe was still there.
2323140	2324620	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
2324620	2325460	That's all I needed.
2325460	2326300	We didn't take it.
2326300	2327940	We could put stuff in it.
2327940	2329180	Are you glad we came?
2329180	2331440	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
2331440	2332280	All right, do your thing.
2332280	2333520	I open up the safe,
2333520	2336400	take out the watch that I had put in there,
2336400	2339200	I put it in my pocket, and I head back to the guys.
2339200	2342640	Yeah, and this kid pays you absolutely no mind
2342640	2345840	because of your critical success,
2345840	2347400	and you make it back,
2347400	2350080	and Tyler greets you with a warm lick on the face.
2350080	2352560	Okay, guys, do you wanna walk to the church
2352560	2354960	or go back to the car, but either way.
2354960	2357400	Keith, why the fuck did we come out here in the first place?
2357400	2359080	I need you to see something.
2359900	2361180	Well, one of you guys put this on,
2361180	2364420	and I reach into my pocket and hold out the watch.
2364420	2366820	Yeah, sure, that's a nice watch, and I put it on.
2366820	2370220	Okay, John Lee Pettymore the Thirth puts it on,
2370220	2372120	and I'm gonna send the other two to the waiting room.
2372120	2372960	Peace out.
2372960	2374780	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
2374780	2379780	Hey, Thomas.
2383100	2384460	Hello, Zach.
2384460	2387260	Thomas, it feels like the consciousness
2387260	2390200	of John Lee Pettymore is changing the channel
2390200	2391800	just like back and forth and back and forth
2391800	2393340	all between these different scenes,
2393340	2396240	and you begin to phase out of your reality
2396240	2399220	as this watch slips onto your wrist,
2399220	2402640	and you seem to be somewhere else entirely,
2402640	2407640	and you feel wet grass and dirt on your fingers,
2407720	2412660	and then the wet grass turns dry, so dry,
2412660	2414640	and the dirt turns to dust,
2414640	2417300	and you look up, and you see contention
2417300	2422300	as an old mining town in the late 1800s,
2422780	2424020	and you look next to you,
2424020	2427600	and you see a man lying face down on the ground,
2427600	2430800	not moving, and then all of a sudden,
2430800	2433200	you're looking at a door in the ground,
2433200	2436400	like a sealed metal door that was mostly buried,
2437340	2440820	and on the door is an inscription,
2440820	2445220	and it says, Pettymore Forevermore,
2448120	2451880	and then the watch is slipped off of your wrist,
2451880	2454760	and you come back to reality.
2454760	2459440	John Lee Pettymore the third puts this watch on,
2459440	2462880	and then quickly pulls the watch off his wrist.
2462880	2464160	Keith, what the hell is this?
2464160	2465000	What'd you see?
2465000	2465820	What'd you see?
2465820	2466760	What does that mean?
2467020	2471060	I saw contention in its early days.
2471060	2473900	I saw a man on the ground face down,
2473900	2475800	and I saw a door.
2475800	2476640	A door in the ground?
2476640	2478940	A door in the ground, yeah.
2478940	2479820	Did you read it?
2479820	2481140	Did it say anything on it?
2481140	2483980	It said, Pettymore Forevermore.
2483980	2487860	When I put that on the first time,
2487860	2492860	I saw a door in the ground, but it had beans on it.
2493000	2497000	The door is just covered in beans.
2498680	2503600	That watch, my father gave that watch to Ferguson as a kid.
2503600	2505720	Why don't we see what happens when Clark puts it on,
2505720	2507680	and I like slap it on your wrist.
2507680	2508520	What do you mean?
2508520	2509680	What do I, you guys are seeing?
2513200	2515180	Bye guys.
2515180	2516020	Look.
2521960	2523560	Hey Joe.
2523560	2524400	Hello.
2524400	2527040	As Clark Bishop has this watch slapped on his wrist,
2527040	2529640	it feels like your consciousness
2529640	2531380	is just flipping through the channels,
2531380	2533600	and you begin to phase out of your reality,
2533600	2535920	and you're somewhere else entirely,
2535920	2540620	and you feel wet grass and dirt on your fingers.
2540640	2545640	The wet grass and dirt turns to dry, dry dust.
2546520	2550760	And you've seen pictures of contention from the late 1800s,
2550760	2552800	but you've never been there.
2552800	2556000	And looking to your left, you see a man who's not moving
2556000	2557880	face down on the ground next to you.
2559120	2561360	You're back in this wet grass and dirt,
2561360	2563960	and you see Maggie Cook's house,
2563960	2568200	and in the backyard there's a door floating in the air.
2568200	2570120	And then all of a sudden you're looking at this door
2570620	2573980	that's mostly buried, sealed, metal door,
2573980	2576180	and there's an inscription on it.
2576180	2581060	It says one, five, two, two, five, one, eight, one,
2581060	2583540	nine, five, five, one, eight,
2584420	2589420	which you immediately can recognize as overseer.
2591060	2592500	That's on the door in the ground?
2592500	2593340	Yep.
2593340	2596660	Okay, okay, okay.
2596660	2597500	I don't get it, but okay.
2597500	2598320	That makes sense.
2598320	2599160	I mean, I kinda get it.
2599160	2600000	I kinda get it.
2606380	2608700	John Lee Pettymore slaps this watch
2608700	2611900	onto Clark Bishop's wrist, and his eyes go blank,
2611900	2614780	and then not hardly any time passes
2614780	2616780	before the watch slips off the wrist
2616780	2618380	and Clark Bishop looks at you.
2618380	2619700	Did you see the door?
2619700	2620740	What did yours say?
2621580	2624980	Door, door, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2624980	2627780	It was the numbers, it was numbers, it was.
2627780	2628620	What numbers?
2629700	2633420	It was the ones they spelled overseer.
2633420	2635020	Oh, shit, well, that's you, Clark.
2635020	2636700	Was the door in the ground?
2636700	2638140	Yeah, yeah.
2638140	2639500	Did you see anything else?
2639500	2642980	Yeah, I saw Maggie's house.
2642980	2645020	I was standing out there in front of it.
2645020	2647340	You know, she lives right there on Bean's Pond,
2647340	2652340	and I saw a door, and it was floating above Bean's Pond,
2653100	2655940	and then suddenly I was looking down at door in the ground,
2655940	2658060	and that's where the numbers were.
2659040	2661520	The numbers spelled out overseer,
2661520	2666520	and I saw the dusty, it looked like really old contention,
2667040	2669800	and there was that guy face down, like you said.
2669800	2674800	When I was in the belly of that beast, I had a vision.
2675320	2679260	Well, I saw my brother in Bean's Pond,
2679260	2680640	but there was no water in it,
2680640	2683020	and he was looking at a door in the ground
2683020	2684720	in the bottom of Bean's Pond.
2684720	2687040	If I interpreted my visions correctly,
2687780	2689460	I think you're onto something.
2689460	2691220	Bean's Pond is involved in some way.
2691220	2692500	Before I brought it up,
2692500	2694240	I wanted you guys to see that watch,
2694240	2696700	but I think we need to go there.
2696700	2697540	Yeah, I mean.
2697540	2699420	What do you guys think is the bigger fish
2699420	2700500	that we need to fry?
2700500	2703440	Well, once the pastor knows we're here, he knows we're here,
2703440	2705540	and we're not gonna be able to get much done.
2705540	2707740	But we do need to save Drew from him.
2707740	2708980	I don't know, boys.
2708980	2710940	Maybe if we find the door, it'll help us.
2710940	2712320	It's gotta mean something.
2712320	2714300	If we happen to choose wrong,
2714320	2717040	we'll hopefully just reset, right?
2717040	2717880	I mean.
2717880	2719160	We got all the time in the world.
2719160	2720000	I would hope so.
2720000	2721800	In increments of two hours every day.
2721800	2725960	We never know when our last, you know, what if it stops?
2727600	2729960	Well, we were lucky to have gotten this far, I think.
2729960	2730800	You know.
2730800	2735800	Really, any time after our first deaths is a blessing,
2740800	2744000	so let's just be thankful for what we got,
2744820	2745660	you know.
2745660	2747980	Don't beat yourself up over losing something
2747980	2749700	you don't even have yet, you know what I mean?
2749700	2752980	Well, I mean, I think we oughta go find the doors.
2752980	2755820	It's been on my mind for days.
2755820	2757900	Yeah, let's fucking knock on these doors.
2757900	2760180	So we're heading to Bean's Pond, eh?
2760180	2763160	Yeah, and I mean, we gotta get to the bottom of it,
2763160	2766940	but the water might be there, and I point to the wall.
2766940	2769300	Have you put the watch on more than once, Keith?
2769300	2773020	No, as soon as I put it on and I locked it up,
2773040	2774760	as soon as I took it off.
2774760	2778240	Okay, Zach, just in the interest of podcast time,
2778240	2780400	if I put this on, will I have the same vision again
2780400	2781520	or a different vision?
2782480	2783960	That seems like a big question.
2783960	2786200	I know, but if the answer is just the same,
2786200	2787960	we can move right along, but.
2787960	2789520	I think you have to say you'll do it, and then see what happens.
2789520	2793560	Since you asked me that, here, give me that back,
2793560	2796120	and I take the watch and put it on one more time.
2796120	2809080	reality blinks and flickers in a now familiar but still unsettling way and you're standing
2809080	2816740	over a man's body who's face down in the dry cracked dirt the smell of piss and shit wafts
2816740	2823360	through the humid summer air and looking down the road to your perceived destination you
2823360	2830800	recognize your hometown of contention back to the body on the ground your hands are trembling
2830800	2837680	as you roll him over a dead man in his mid-20s stiff as a glass of moonshine dressed in the
2837680	2844260	fashion of the day which is the late 1800s and a tri-folded piece of parchment falls
2844260	2851000	out of this deceased man's jacket pocket it's a job advertisement for the contention mining
2851000	2860840	company and it reads we is hiring able bodies readying untapped site plenty of work hesitate
2860840	2861200	not
2881000	2896160	try
2911000	2912160	bye
