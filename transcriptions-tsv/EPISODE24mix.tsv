1800	4780	It's your pizza delivery driver, Wolf the Dog.
4780	6440	And I'm here to deliver you a box
6440	8720	of hot, fresh, contention news pizza
8720	12200	in 30 minutes or less, or you get your money back.
12200	13620	And y'all know we are delivering
13620	16080	that steamy, gooey, cheesy news
16080	20080	straight from 694.2 PTBP.
20080	22360	Wolf the Dog's favorite kind of pizza
22360	26200	is mayonnaise pizza with anchovies on it.
26200	29640	I like my pizza to have some extra stink on it,
29640	30680	my babies.
30680	32840	Now, before y'all burn the roof of your mouth
32840	36080	on that hot delivery, we got an announcement.
36080	38240	This week, Wolf is here to tell y'all
38240	40640	that we are going to have a special presentation
40640	44720	in a few weeks here on 694.2 PTBP,
44720	49160	contention's newest and only radio station.
49160	51800	We are going to broadcast a recap episode
51800	54860	with listener Q&A from a podcast
54860	58000	called Pretending to be People.

77000	79280	and send them that so they can use it
79280	81300	in the episode, my babies.
81300	84120	Speaking of questions, I want answers.
84120	86440	It's time for the news.
86440	88600	Officer Keith Vigna convinced a woman
88600	92320	to murder Ferguson, his handsome and well-dressed brother.
92320	94800	He then murdered that woman and stole the watch
94800	97120	that was passed down from William Beanes
97120	99300	off of Fergie's corpse.
99300	103200	Currently, Keith is in bed at Hotel Motel.
103200	106240	Call him Ferguson, call him the Duke.
106240	109640	Either way, he's a real motherfucker.
109640	112280	Currently, Officer John Lee Pettymore
112280	114640	and Drew Andrews are being held hostage
114640	117800	by the Fonzie lady who works for Marvin Glass
117800	121140	after she killed two of the Pettymore cousins.
121140	124760	I'm grieving all week with you, John P.
124760	126920	Officer Clark Bishop was inducted
126920	129240	into the Circle of Knowledge.
129240	133040	There, he ran into a mysterious woman from his past.
133040	135640	Currently, Clark is in a cab headed back
135640	139740	to contention from the mill on the other side of the city.
139740	142440	There's always something happening in contention,
142480	147480	and 100% of the time, it is Kudzu with no backbone.
163860	165680	I had a guy jump in front of my car today
165680	167040	and I thought I had killed him,
167040	168880	and in fact, I think he might have been a ghost
168880	170400	because I don't know how I didn't hit him.
170400	171520	Wait, what?
171520	172800	I was driving down town.
172800	174800	Joe killed again, but he just kept going.
174800	175640	That's exactly.
175640	177800	I was driving downtown right in front of Jimmy John's.
177800	179800	This guy was walking on the sidewalk,
179800	181900	and I don't know if he was fucking with me
181900	183920	or if he really was trying to commit suicide,
183920	185800	but he did this big, exaggerated
187800	189520	Oh, wow. leap in front of my car,
189520	191320	and I didn't adjust.
191320	194960	I mean, it was as if he wanted to slap my headlight.
194960	196940	He was that close when he jumped,
196940	198640	and I didn't feel a bump or anything,
198640	199760	and I looked in my rear-view mirror,
199760	201600	and he was just walking and looked at me
201600	204220	and just kept walking with headphones on.
204220	205440	I don't know what he was doing.
205440	206500	I think he was fucking with me,
206500	209780	but how I didn't hit him is still a mystery to me.
209780	210620	It was insane.
210620	212120	That's a dumb way to fuck with people.
212120	212960	Yeah.
215360	216480	My life in DJ.
216480	218140	I know a hilarious prank.
219080	221100	When I went to the movie today,
221100	224160	I picked the second row in the very middle
224160	226160	where no one else was sitting,
226160	230160	and then I sit down, and the waiter comes up,
230160	231000	and I look over,
231000	233540	and the woman that had come in behind me
233540	237640	with three very rowdy children comes and looks,
237640	239960	and she goes, oh, I didn't realize you were sitting here,
239960	242780	and sits right next to me with her three kids,
242780	246240	and I was like, are you fucking kidding me?
247080	248380	Hey, I'm your dad now, kids.
248380	249320	It wasn't a bunch of kids,
249320	250960	but that happened to me at LMO
250960	252040	where it was an empty theater,
252040	253340	and I'd got my tickets early,
253380	257020	and then one other guy had gotten the seat next to me.
257020	258540	I was like, why would you have picked that,
258540	259900	or why did they give you that seat?
259900	261900	I don't understand how this happened.
261900	263360	And she said something, she's like,
263360	264840	oh, I'm so sorry, blah, blah, blah,
264840	265700	and I was like, you know what?
265700	267820	I came to a children's movie.
269300	270920	I was kind of expecting kids to be here.
270920	272900	I was like, just didn't expect somebody
272900	273740	to sit right next to me,
273740	275300	and she goes, you look really familiar,
275300	278280	and it turns out I had served her at Jilardi's once,
278280	283020	and she added me on Facebook a long time ago,
284020	286820	but she can't be 30 years old, but like, yeah.
286820	288500	So she was talking to me,
288500	290340	but she was fucking talking to me the whole time,
290340	291160	the whole movie.
291160	292000	Oh, you want the movie?
292000	293260	Yeah, dude.
293260	295860	She did share her pizza and her popcorn with me though.
295860	297080	That's cool as fuck.
297080	297920	However.
297920	299860	She wants you to raise those kids.
299860	302380	No joke, she goes, you kind of look like the dad now,
302380	305340	and I was like, yep.
305340	308260	That was planned, that was a planned move.
308260	310460	That was an absolute planned move.
310460	313100	Jesus, she was going to the Alamo to get a hubby.
313100	314260	Yep.
314260	316560	And she would call you hubby too.
316560	317800	I'm the dad now.
317800	319420	She was like, I'll hit you up on Facebook
319420	320740	next time I want to go see a movie.
320740	322780	I was like, yeah, sure.
322780	323940	Hold on just a second.
323940	328340	What would have happened if you would have written on a card
328340	332680	and told the people who work at Alamo
332680	334020	that the woman sitting next to you
334020	336300	won't stop talking to you?
336300	337540	But it's just escorted her out,
337540	340300	and you're like studiously not making eye contact.
340820	343540	Just looks at it and then looks up at her and is like,
343540	347300	ma'am, someone in the theater.
347300	349540	When we do the dream sequence thing,
349540	353020	is that going to be solo, red solo cup?
353020	354860	Solo, dolo.
354860	358140	Would you guys like to explain how this session is
358140	360860	going to start, or at least what I told you
360860	361980	and what you had to do?
361980	362740	Oh, yeah.
362740	364100	So you asked us.
364100	365260	Gearing up to this session.
365260	369460	You asked us to ask one yes or no question about the campaign
369500	373460	that you would answer truthfully in the form of a dream.
373460	375300	Wow, that was really succinct.
375300	377580	But I don't remember my dream I had last night,
377580	379420	so you might have to do it in real life.
379420	381500	Can you tell us the dreams you gave us?
381500	382500	What?
382500	384260	With your minds.
384260	387620	Luke's joke was that you were putting dreams in our head.
387620	388780	Which I do.
388780	390500	Which is like, you do that.
390500	392580	Yeah, you do pop up in my dreams a lot.
392580	393500	That makes sense.
393500	394320	Theoretically.
394320	396240	Oh, that makes sense.
396240	397080	Oh.
397080	397900	That makes sense.
397900	398740	Oh.
400180	402180	I'm coming.
402180	405420	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I'm coming.
408060	409020	Oh, boy.
409020	410300	You know, it's good to practice.
410300	412940	My panties are wet.
412940	413660	Same voice.
413660	415820	Well, with that, we'll start with Luke.
415820	418660	So do you remember the last thing
418660	420580	that happened to Keith Wigner?
420580	421860	I killed my brother.
421860	422700	Yeah, basically.
422700	425860	I orchestrated a plan to have my brother killed.
425860	429100	Yeah, and then pulled it off pretty well.
429620	433380	Also, yeah, I ended up, there's a little collateral damage.
433380	435980	Not that Keith cares, but yeah.
435980	436820	Jesus.
436820	437980	What was her name, Joan?
437980	438820	Joan.
438820	441600	Joan and Fergie are both.
441600	442860	Joan Robin.
442860	444740	And the last thing I believe that you did
444740	446700	was you made it back to Hotel Motel
446700	450700	and you put the watch that Ferguson had been wearing
450700	453640	within the handkerchief into your hotel safe.
453640	454480	Yes.
454480	455980	The motel's safe.
456020	459740	And your room, and then you went to sleep.
459740	463420	Keith Wigner, you are standing at a bar.
463420	466620	It is empty, except for yourself and the bartender.
466620	469140	The place smells like piss and vomit.
469140	471880	It looks like people left in a hurry.
471880	474320	The man behind the bar, he's like wearing clothes
474320	478280	that they look like they're from the Gilded Age,
478280	480140	you know, late 1800s.
480140	482940	He looks at you with a fearful smile.
483900	486700	What can I get you, sir?
486700	488120	Answers?
488120	488960	Cocaine?
490580	493100	The prior, what's that, what do you say?
493100	495340	The previous one, the first one.
495340	497000	Not the latter.
497000	497840	As soon as you.
497840	498660	I got enough of that.
498660	501780	As soon as you stumble over all of those words,
501780	505020	the saloon-style doors of this wooden floor joint
505020	508180	fling open as a woman that you recognize
508180	512260	struts toward your side, carrying with her a massive trunk.
512260	515620	She heaves it onto the bar and opens it up,
515620	518400	revealing a few familiar items.
518400	521180	The camera, the gun, and the radio
521180	523300	are sitting there in the trunk.
523300	527540	The camera's light is red, as is the light on the gun,
527540	530100	but the light on the radio is green,
530100	531880	and you hear yourself say,
533100	536820	well, fuck, Mary, the camera won't be ready until one,
536820	538900	and you know these other two take a few days.
538900	540260	What if they came for me?
540260	541620	What if they come for me?
541860	546140	Immediately, she's gone, and Lloyd, the barkeep,
546140	549620	pulls a corkscrew out of his pocket and holds it out,
549620	553660	and holds it on the bar in front of you, pointy-side up.
553660	557260	Abruptly, he slams his fucking head into the corkscrew
557260	560580	and stares at you as he begins twisting the corkscrew,
560580	565380	little bits of cocaine falling out of the hole in his head.
565380	568940	You look down, and the coke has fallen into perfect lines,
568980	573260	forming a little stick figure family of uppers.
573260	577420	You pull out a $100 bill that has Abraham Lincoln on it,
577420	579860	and you roll it up real tight.
579860	583600	As you inhale the powder bumper sticker family,
583600	587540	Lloyd steps backward, phasing through the wall of the bar,
587540	590680	and disappearing from sight completely.
590680	593580	You are pulling into the police department parking lot
593580	596940	in your police cruiser, and you have that weird feeling,
596940	600020	like you were on autopilot the whole drive.
600020	602300	You were just remembering your dream from last night.
602300	603980	That's not the only thing on your mind, though.
603980	607740	You see yourself grabbing the revolver with your handkerchief,
607740	611380	putting it in her hands, and pulling the trigger.
611380	613060	You see the flash.
613060	616980	You see her blood spill out onto the duvet cover.
616980	621020	You're parked in the contention police department parking lot.
621020	621860	Damn.
626940	634340	John Lee.
634340	638260	The ground is hard, wet, and cold.
638260	641980	You are rolling across it with relative ease,
641980	645380	avoiding the sight of the older man in the fancy suit
645380	648460	mopping the floor and singing mouth trumpet,
648460	650820	along with Louis Armstrong.
650820	653220	Looking up out the window,
653220	656300	you notice it is dark and stormy outside.
657100	661180	The door that reads open from your side swings in,
661180	663140	and the bell atop the door rings,
663140	665500	queuing the owner of this establishment
665500	669860	to stop his portable music player and holler,
669860	672940	We're closed for the night, bud.
672940	675780	You look up to the figure standing in the doorway,
675780	678820	their black cloak shielding their identity,
678820	682180	just as they drop a massive book on the ground
682180	684980	and stumble back out into the night.
685020	688220	Your vision blurs and distorts, disorienting you,
688220	691460	and it feels like the world is upside down.
691460	693900	You look around, and you are sitting on the floor
693900	695580	in the back of clinkers.
695580	698020	The sound of some children's television program
698020	700980	being blared over pool balls and drunken conversation
700980	703180	is immediately nostalgic.
703180	706620	A young Gary Daley, an oversized sweater
706620	708340	and tall white socks,
708340	713340	walks in and pulls a large leather book out of his bag.
713500	716580	He looks over his shoulder as he opens the book,
716580	720300	and he winces as he rips a page from the big old tome.
720300	724860	He pauses, listens, quickly puts the book back in his bag
724860	729100	as he moves directly toward you with his torn sheet in hand.
729100	732540	Pulling out a knife, Gary Daley begins chanting,
732540	734860	reading from this paper.
734860	737980	The script seems to catch little sparks
737980	741740	as he mutters each phrase like a karaoke situation,
741740	744060	but with paper and fire.
744060	747660	He continues to chant as he presses the blade of the knife
747660	751380	against his thumb, the elasticity of his skin
751380	753060	gaining more and more tension
753060	756140	until finally breaking under enough pressure
756140	760020	and releasing the blood necessary to complete this spell.
760020	764020	Gary Daley clenches his fist and holds it above your head,
764020	768100	letting a few drops fall onto your bald baby head.
769180	771620	The sparks ignite what remains of the paper
772460	774700	and the flames begin to float and dance in the air.
774700	778260	These tiny bits of flame do a little synchronized jig
778260	782300	around your head, bathing your body in warm light.
782300	785740	The flames disappear and Gary quickly grabs a rag
785740	787940	and washes the blood off of your baby head
787940	790300	while he talks to himself.
790300	792460	Grandpa, you kooky old wizard.
792460	793980	I hope this does him good.
793980	797060	Well, two down, one to go.
797060	800620	Hey, hey John, what are you thinking about?
801660	804420	You realize you have pulled into the parking lot
804420	806180	of the contention police department
806180	810180	in Drew's cherry red Mini Cooper with black stripes.
810180	814020	A terrified Drew Andrews is sitting silently next to you.
814020	815780	A woman who fashions herself
815780	817900	to look like Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli
817900	820940	from the 1970s television program Happy Days
820940	824780	is sitting in the back seat holding both of your guns.
824780	826220	Now she still has the guns.
831620	836620	Every move you make, every bond you break,
845860	849740	every step you take, I'll be watching you.
849740	851700	I'll be watching you.
851700	854860	Oh, right.
854860	855900	Joe, you remember the last thing
855900	857060	that happened to Clark Bishop?
857060	858580	Kinda.
858620	862180	I think you kinda blacked out in an odd place
862180	866060	and came to for a second in a taxi.
866060	867780	Oh, you mean at the end, yeah, yeah.
867780	871500	And you turned back and you were leaving the middle.
871500	873060	Which is probably just a Quinkadink.
873060	874020	Can't mean anything.
874020	874980	Nope.
874980	878780	You realize how close you are and so you begin to run.
878780	882660	You do not stop, you do not slow, you run.
882660	886140	It is imperative that you get there, that you stop them.
887140	889780	Fuck, you're on the highway, you dodge the traffic,
889780	891900	you can make it, you jump off the bridge.
891900	893660	There's no way you're going to hit the water,
893660	895300	you brace for impact.
895300	896740	You've seen a lot of fucked up shit
896740	898980	but you can't remember a time when your shin bone
898980	900980	was shooting through your kneecap.
900980	903540	Fuck, your pain tolerance is incredible.
903540	904700	You keep running.
904700	906780	It doesn't really look like running anymore
906780	908460	but you fight through the awkwardness.
908460	910540	The blood loss is massive.
910540	914500	Then you see it, your old nemesis, your old buddy old pal.
914500	918700	You remember why these animals are filling the creeks.
918700	920860	You get the fuck in the creek too.
920860	922540	Blood is trailing behind
922540	924900	and the pain in your knee is searing.
924900	927820	Your favorite black mass is following you
927820	930620	along the shoreline and that's when you see it.
930620	932780	You're just there in the window.
932780	934780	Think fuck what happened stance.
934780	936340	You keep hobbling down the creek
936340	939540	trying to outpace your enemies before you're gone.
939540	941820	At the closest point to your backyard,
941820	943980	you muster everything in your reserves
943980	945540	and leap out of the creek,
945540	948340	waving your arms violently and shouting.
948340	951420	You desperately attempt to get your attention.
951420	955180	Run, run, get the fuck out of there.
955180	956900	You can get it right this time.
956900	959860	You wake up in the back of the cab
959860	963180	as it makes a sharp turn and hits a curb.
963180	966660	Looking out the window, you see that you have just arrived
966660	968460	at the contention police department.
973980	978980	Yeah, like a horse walks into a bar, yeah.
984060	987020	Except it was not, he wasn't there for drinks.
987020	988580	He was there for a fight.
988580	990460	I was trying to think what I would do in that situation.
990460	993020	You yell, why the long face?
994340	995380	You get out of the way.
995380	997860	Yeah, it's a horsey run.
997860	998740	No, that's what I mean though,
998740	1001100	is the video, it's a really skinny room.
1001100	1004460	No, yeah, it's a narrow, all along this long bar.
1004460	1006100	One of the guys looks like he's about
1006100	1007340	to get kicked in the face.
1007340	1009540	I know, he looks resigned to it.
1009540	1011100	He's like, I'm not gonna be able to outrun it,
1011100	1012580	and I'm not gonna be able to get across its path.
1012580	1013900	Is it jumping and stuff?
1013900	1015580	Yeah, it's freakin' like,
1015580	1016980	yeah, it's saddle broke or something,
1016980	1017820	and it's freaking the fuck out.
1017820	1019140	Oh, like a horse would in a restaurant?
1019140	1019980	Yeah, exactly.
1019980	1021660	Yeah, just kind of like that.
1021660	1023100	It looks like a bucking Bronco
1023100	1024980	going one way through this restaurant
1024980	1026380	and then coming back the other way
1026380	1028020	as people just fucking scatter.
1028020	1030740	It made everyone a rodeo clown that day.
1031260	1032700	It was kicking tables and chairs and shit.
1032700	1035060	You could have had collateral damage either.
1035060	1036380	It was kicking that shit so hard.
1036380	1039580	It was like a cartoon flinging a chair back behind it.
1039580	1040780	This was a terrified horse.
1040780	1042100	On the news, it was like,
1042100	1043180	they interviewed the owner,
1043180	1046060	and it says, he likes to run away a lot.
1046060	1047180	This isn't surprising.
1047180	1049360	It's like, well, that's not good.
1050500	1051340	Yeah, it's not.
1051340	1053220	I brought it to this parade in the middle of town.
1053220	1054620	Your horse is in my bar.
1054620	1058300	Classic, classic Seabiscuit.
1058300	1060180	I always thought that might happen someday.
1061020	1063380	Did you at least get a cool video of it?
1063380	1065980	Well, you got to look out for those chairs that are flying
1065980	1068860	because they're flying at approximately one horsepower.
1068860	1070340	Whoa.
1070340	1071180	That was good.
1071180	1072420	That was science.
1072420	1073260	No, not boo.
1073260	1074100	No, it's just true.
1074100	1074940	Nay.
1077940	1078940	Hey.
1078940	1080020	The town of-
1080020	1082300	Hey is for horse and strength.
1082300	1083220	So close.
1084460	1086820	So close to a seamless transition.
1087820	1090780	Can I ask you an equestrian?
1090780	1092780	Oh my God.
1092780	1094060	Can we ask one more question?
1094060	1095780	No, not bound by the truth.
1095780	1096980	Yes, no restraints.
1096980	1098740	Yeah, yeah, just shoot.
1098740	1099580	Who did it?
1099580	1100420	Who did it?
1100420	1102100	He just doesn't have to tell us the truth.
1102100	1103180	Here's the goo.
1103180	1105940	Thomas's first question that he tried to send me was,
1105940	1106860	who-
1106860	1109780	No, what were the final hours of Maggie's,
1109780	1110860	Chief Maggie's life?
1110860	1111700	Nice.
1111700	1113540	I was like, reveal that to me in a dream.
1113540	1114740	Who killed her?
1114740	1115860	Tell me who killed her.
1115900	1117060	Art galore, dude.
1117060	1118620	I will say, you told us a while ago
1118620	1121060	that you might give us a chance to ask a question.
1121060	1123620	So for a while now I've been thinking about
1123620	1126660	really good heart of the issue questions
1126660	1128500	that you would have to elaborate on.
1128500	1130740	And when you gave us the yes or no right at the end there,
1130740	1131860	I was like, fuck.
1131860	1135580	Yeah, and I only gave you like 10 hours to think about it.
1135580	1137020	I think mine was pretty good.
1137020	1140540	The town of contention is draped in a thin layer of fog
1140540	1145540	on this sharp blustery not yet morning of December 5th.
1145860	1149660	There is an old Husky, a dirty shade of white,
1149660	1153100	walking slowly down the middle of the road.
1153100	1156500	The ancient dog's paw pauses mid-step
1156500	1159780	when it hears the humming of car engines approaching,
1159780	1162220	the only sound cutting through the dormant town
1162220	1163980	aside from the howling of the wind.
1165100	1168020	Through the arthritic pain pulsating through her joints,
1168020	1170420	this old Husky bounds off the street
1170420	1173180	and down an alley has three cars,
1173180	1176540	a yellow taxi cab, a cherry red Mini Cooper
1176540	1180420	with black stripes, and a contention police cruiser
1180420	1183500	pull into the contention police department parking lot.
1185020	1187820	John, do you wanna, or Thomas, do you wanna describe
1187820	1190780	what they see in the Mini Cooper?
1190780	1195180	Yeah, they see me, shit, sorry, I'm not Thomas.
1195180	1197540	I'm John Leapa anymore, oh, fuck it.
1197540	1198780	You can tell it's in Thomas.
1198780	1199620	Yeah, they see.
1199660	1204660	They see John Lee Pettymore, they see Drew driving his car,
1208260	1210260	which they would recognize as his,
1210260	1213380	and they see the Fonzie lady in the backseat.
1213380	1214220	Okay.
1215220	1217180	Does Clark have his wallet on him?
1217180	1218460	Do we all get there at the same time?
1218460	1220340	You all get there at the exact same time.
1220340	1221460	Clark, you.
1221460	1223460	Okay, so then they would also see John Lee Pettymore
1223460	1226540	like eyes super wide, like yanking his head
1226980	1230060	at the lady, like, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
1230060	1231180	Get a load of this.
1231180	1232580	Do I have everything on me?
1233660	1235620	You are wearing your pajamas,
1235620	1238540	and you don't have your cell phone, or your wallet,
1238540	1240340	or your gun on you.
1240340	1241180	Okay.
1241180	1242220	We're all in the parking lot.
1242220	1243220	You're all in the parking lot.
1243220	1245020	Okay, I get out of my cruiser.
1245020	1248460	I assume I am, I've got all my police uniform and everything.
1248460	1249300	Absolutely.
1249300	1251720	I get out, and I wait for them to get out.
1251720	1254060	So I say, what's her name?
1254060	1255860	You don't know yet, you've never asked her.
1255860	1257500	First of all, I say, all right,
1257500	1259060	we never got this out of the way.
1259060	1261180	First, I'm Officer John Lee Pettymore.
1261180	1262660	Yeah, I know.
1262660	1263500	What's your name?
1263500	1264780	Rosemary.
1264780	1266220	Rosemary, that's a very pretty name.
1266220	1267060	Thank you.
1267060	1268840	So check it out.
1268840	1270380	If you wanna get that gun.
1270380	1271420	Yeah, I do.
1271420	1273780	Yeah, you're gonna have to give us our guns back.
1273780	1275180	That's fine.
1275180	1278300	Just so you know, if I go missing or anything,
1278300	1280300	you're done, you're over.
1280300	1283180	You will be taken, you will be tortured.
1283180	1286460	Marvin Glass does not fuck around,
1286460	1288660	and he wants this gun, he wants it real bad,
1288660	1290460	and he's gonna get it.
1290460	1292780	Rosemary, I really hope you understand
1292780	1296160	that Marvin Glass is the least of my worries right now.
1296160	1298180	And he can send all of his goons,
1298180	1302180	but what we're dealing with is just a bit more stressful.
1302180	1304960	That's why I want you to help me.
1304960	1306140	So let's go get that gun.
1306140	1307540	All right, let's go get that gun.
1307540	1309340	Okay, my guns please though.
1309340	1310180	Okay.
1310180	1311220	All right, thank you.
1311220	1313300	And she hands your gun back to you,
1313300	1316460	and she hands the gun that you let Drew have back to him.
1316460	1317300	I take it.
1317300	1319020	Oh, okay.
1319020	1320420	Also, you guys would all notice
1320420	1321820	there's a car in the parking lot
1321820	1323540	that none of you recognize.
1323540	1327200	It is a red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.
1327200	1328040	Hell yeah.
1328040	1329400	I lean up to my cabbie.
1330900	1334980	I'm a little short, I don't have my wallet on me, my man.
1334980	1337300	Is there any chance I could get this right on the house,
1337300	1338620	pay it back next time I see you?
1338620	1340980	He turns and looks at you, and he's just like.
1341580	1342420	Nope.
1344980	1348220	Well, is this the Sesame Street taxi driver?
1348220	1349300	It's Oscar.
1349300	1350920	It's already been paid for.
1350920	1352340	Oh, I was linching.
1352340	1356500	Okay, you have a good night, and I get up.
1356500	1360700	He drives off as your first foot steps out of the door.
1360700	1362420	Clark, who was that spooky cab driver?
1362420	1366300	He was just giving me a ride to the station here.
1366300	1369780	Why don't you have, why are you in your pajamas?
1369780	1373900	I was sleepwalking.
1373900	1374740	Yeah?
1374740	1376820	I must've ended up here sleepwalking.
1376820	1379180	Well, you're a great liar, Clark.
1381340	1383860	Everybody, I want y'all to meet Rosemary.
1383860	1384700	Hey.
1384700	1385780	Rosemary, this is everyone.
1385780	1386620	Hey, I remember.
1386620	1388260	I immediately get freaked out.
1388260	1389100	Hey, it's okay.
1389100	1390140	Keith, Keith, get your gun on her.
1390140	1392500	No, no, no, no, guys, hold on, hold on.
1392500	1395160	She doesn't have a, I got my guns, it's all good.
1395160	1396300	How did you?
1396300	1398700	It's okay, it's fine, we're working together,
1398700	1400140	you guys are gonna give me the gun,
1400140	1401460	and then we're all gonna be friends,
1401460	1402620	everything's gonna be fine.
1402620	1404460	Well, what's gonna happen, Rosemary,
1404460	1409220	is that we're gonna go with you to the city with the gun.
1409220	1410660	Yeah, sure, whatever, fine.
1410660	1411920	We might give Marvin the gun
1411920	1414180	if he really decides he wants it at the end of things, but.
1414180	1415020	Okay.
1415020	1415840	Yeah, I think he wants it.
1415840	1417300	When did we decide all this?
1417300	1418980	You weren't really there.
1418980	1422500	You see, she had just executed two of my cousins
1422500	1424340	for no particular reason.
1424340	1425580	They were running away.
1425580	1427060	Keith, get your gun on her.
1427060	1429740	I've got two guns on her, and she's fine.
1429740	1431620	I do have, I have my hand on my gun,
1431620	1433340	but it's still holstered.
1433340	1436620	Anyway, y'all remember, y'all remember the Glass boys?
1436620	1437460	Oh, yeah.
1437460	1438660	Jermaine and Albert, is it?
1438660	1439480	Alfred.
1439480	1441380	Alfred, one of whom disappeared,
1441380	1443640	the other one wasn't, quit babbling about that gun.
1443640	1444480	Yep.
1444480	1447280	Well, so Rosemary here and Charles Donovan,
1447280	1450180	they're in our little town, trying to find those boys,
1450180	1454460	trying to find the gun that, Alfred, which one's around?
1454460	1455820	Which one's gone, which one's around?
1455820	1458860	Alfred's still around, but I mean, not really mentally.
1458860	1460380	Yeah, he won't shut up about the gun,
1460380	1463260	so Marvin Glass, that's Alfred's daddy.
1463260	1464500	He really wants that gun.
1464500	1465780	So we're gonna go talk to him?
1465780	1468300	Well, Marvin Glass is the head of the Glass crime family,
1468300	1471740	and I think if he wants his boy back,
1471740	1473640	he has some considerable resources
1473640	1475120	we might be able to call upon
1475120	1477440	to help us fight this unholy terror
1477440	1479060	that's descended upon our town.
1479060	1480620	So I kinda made an executive decision,
1480620	1482820	and I enlisted the mob to help us.
1482820	1484220	I'm here, I'm the mob,
1484260	1486620	and we're all gonna do great together, I think.
1486620	1490580	The contention police department and the Glass crime family
1490580	1493560	are going to be wonderful business partners
1493560	1494780	from here on out.
1494780	1496380	In temporary cahoots.
1496380	1498540	And she puts her hand on Clark Bishop's shoulder.
1498540	1499760	Yeah, Clark, you cool with that?
1499760	1500680	Good, good.
1500680	1501840	Keith, you cool with that?
1501840	1502680	Sure.
1502680	1505200	I elbow her and get away from the hand.
1505200	1509060	I turn directly to John, why does Marvin want the gun?
1509060	1511600	Well, okay, see, that's what's gonna happen,
1511600	1512860	is Marvin wants the gun
1512860	1515220	because he thinks he can turn his boy back around.
1515220	1517400	We have just seen the gun disappear, people,
1517400	1520060	so I don't think it doesn't really work that way,
1520060	1522300	but I think if we all put our heads together,
1522300	1525100	we can maybe bring some people back, like Tilly Bee.
1525100	1526420	Rosemary leans forward,
1526420	1528660	putting her head in the center of the group.
1528660	1529660	I push her back out.
1530540	1531940	Not Rosemary, this is.
1531940	1533540	And I kinda close off for that gap.
1533540	1535740	Oh, I thought we were putting our heads together.
1535740	1538420	No, Rosemary, this isn't about you, really.
1539420	1541540	So yeah, he wants that gun
1541540	1543220	because he thinks it'll help his boy,
1543220	1544740	or bring his boy back.
1544740	1546540	I think the only way to get the boy back
1546540	1548180	is to defeat this, you know,
1549380	1551660	ancient evil that's descended upon us,
1551660	1554860	and I think we might need more than just the three of us
1554860	1559140	to do that, so I thought maybe a bunch of mafia gins
1559140	1560180	would help things out,
1560180	1562700	like, and one very motivated mafia boss
1562700	1564160	trying to get his son back.
1564160	1565000	Yeah.
1565000	1565900	Do you see, I mean, because.
1565900	1567260	I don't have any better ideas.
1567260	1568860	Because they, like, the feds came by
1568860	1569700	and they weren't much help,
1569740	1570820	they're like, call this number
1570820	1572260	if you don't solve it in two days,
1572260	1573640	so I called the mob.
1579060	1582660	John, when would we be heading up to the city?
1582660	1583500	Right now.
1583500	1585340	You guys don't, I was gonna go,
1585340	1586540	me and Drew were gonna go,
1586540	1588420	y'all can go though, it might be helpful too,
1588420	1589780	but I don't know if we should leave,
1589780	1592900	you know what, I mean, it's an hour away.
1592900	1595100	Goo's not gonna eat the town in two hours, right?
1595100	1596020	Well, I hope not.
1596020	1598340	Did y'all see that dog on the way over here?
1598340	1600140	Why was it out of the water?
1600140	1600980	Oh.
1600980	1602260	Y'all seen any more, have we,
1602260	1605100	can I do a perception check or awareness check
1605100	1606920	to see if I've noticed other dogs
1606920	1609260	or animals wandering around like not.
1609260	1611100	You wouldn't need to roll to know
1611100	1613460	that it's been like this for a couple days now
1613460	1615320	or there have been any animals,
1615320	1619740	and this is absolutely the first animal you've seen
1619740	1621620	not in water in a couple days.
1621620	1622860	Okay, cool.
1622860	1624300	How far back was that dog?
1624300	1625660	It was right before we turned in, right?
1625660	1629060	Let's go catch it or talk to it or pet it.
1629060	1630300	Always thinking with your stomach.
1630300	1631140	Pet it.
1631140	1631980	Let's go pet it.
1631980	1633660	It wasn't a black lab, was it?
1633660	1636280	No, it was a husky, an old husky.
1636280	1639060	Why, you having weird dreams or something about black labs?
1639060	1641360	No, Kerry Page's dog's still missing.
1642860	1645960	Yeah, I think we know the creek to find that dog in.
1645960	1648180	It wasn't there when we passed it last night.
1648180	1649020	Fuck, maybe that dog needs more of it.
1649020	1651760	Well, maybe you should go get your clothes on.
1651760	1652600	That's a good idea.
1652600	1653900	One of you boys wanna give me a ride home real quick?
1653900	1656460	Don't you not have extras in the lockers right in there?
1656460	1657280	Do I?
1657280	1658120	Yeah, absolutely.
1658120	1659060	I'll go in and get changed.
1659060	1659900	Yeah.
1659900	1662000	Yeah, Clark, honestly, you're disgracing the badge right now.
1662000	1662960	Just Clark going in?
1662960	1663800	Yeah.
1663800	1664920	Oh, no, I'm gonna go get that gun.
1664920	1665760	Ah, right.
1665760	1667660	I wanna stay out here and look at the dog,
1667660	1668660	look for the dog.
1668660	1671340	I wanna go inside with them.
1671340	1674960	I toss the handgun to Drew, and I'm like, Drew, guard her.
1676420	1679820	No, man, well, I guess we've got what she wants, so.
1681780	1683020	He finally catches it.
1683060	1684220	I'm like, all right, all right, all right.
1684220	1685060	Everybody come in.
1685060	1685900	You two come inside.
1685900	1687020	Yeah, I'll come in.
1687020	1688140	Follow us, Rosemary.
1688140	1688980	Yeah, okay.
1688980	1690760	As I'm heading toward the door, I notice that car.
1690760	1691600	Yeah.
1691600	1693260	And I don't open the door, and I look back at you guys.
1693260	1694640	You guys know whose car that is?
1694640	1695480	That red?
1695480	1697000	No, I've never seen that car before.
1697000	1697840	No idea.
1697840	1699980	I look through the glass of the police department.
1699980	1701420	Do I see anybody through the glass?
1701420	1702780	You don't see anybody through the glass,
1702780	1706900	but you do see that the desk that Drew uses
1706900	1709380	that is within sight of the doorway
1709380	1713340	has papers stacked super high on the desk
1713340	1715580	that weren't there the last time you were at the station.
1715580	1717820	And Drew normally keeps his desk pretty clean.
1717820	1719700	Drew, give me that gun.
1719700	1720780	Give it back, all right.
1720780	1722480	Now get down, get behind one of these cars, Drew.
1722480	1723320	Okay.
1723320	1724820	A bigger one than your Mini Cooper.
1724820	1725660	Okay.
1725660	1726480	All right, be safe, buddy.
1726480	1728060	I wanna go look inside that car.
1728060	1728900	Okay.
1728900	1731380	I wanna kick the door down holding both those guns
1731380	1733820	and shout, freeze, motherfucker, contention PD.
1733820	1736620	Okay, let's take those one at a time.
1736620	1739060	So first, Keith, you walk over
1739060	1742380	to the red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.
1742380	1744260	Freeze, motherfucker, contention PD.
1745660	1746780	I put my hands up.
1749520	1751380	And do you, what do you do?
1751380	1752500	You kick in the door?
1752500	1753420	I'll wait.
1753420	1755320	I'm about to, but I see him go over there,
1755320	1757660	so I pause with my foot just like inches away.
1757660	1759980	I put my finger up, I'm like, shh.
1759980	1760820	Oh, I've got two guns.
1760820	1762060	In case the car can hear us.
1762060	1762900	Totally.
1762980	1767100	You look inside of it and inside the car,
1767100	1772100	you see there's a big container of creatine powder
1773180	1776460	sitting in the floorboard of the shotgun seat.
1776460	1777620	That's like protein powder, right?
1777620	1778980	Protein powder, yes, sir.
1778980	1783980	And you also see two empty cans of Red Bull, the big ones.
1784900	1786580	The big ones.
1786580	1791580	You also see a pair of Oakleys sitting on the seat,
1791660	1792660	the shotgun seat.
1793260	1796340	Boys, it looks like we're dealing with a strong foe here.
1798340	1799180	A douchebag.
1799180	1800220	We got a real douchebag here.
1800220	1801380	Is this a two-door car?
1801380	1803000	I believe it is a two-door car.
1803000	1804780	All right, anything in the backseat?
1804780	1805620	No.
1805620	1809140	Okay, I turn around and I'm like, yeah, let's go inside.
1809140	1811620	Okay, so yeah, I kick open the door and I shout,
1811620	1812540	potential proof.
1814500	1818620	Potention PD, contention PD, freeze, douchebag.
1819620	1824620	And as you rush in, I assume, to the police department,
1824980	1830140	you see a young man who was just previously
1830140	1832780	walking furiously back and forth.
1832780	1836020	He's frozen solid, hands up in the air.
1836020	1838940	He's wearing a navy blue suit with a white shirt
1838940	1840460	and a red stripe tie.
1840460	1844220	And in one hand, he is holding a large can of Red Bull.
1844220	1845340	Drop it, party boy.
1845340	1848140	He drops the can of Red Bull and it hits the ground
1848580	1851740	and begins to spill onto the carpet,
1851740	1854660	the like very thin, shitty carpet
1854660	1856300	of the contention police department.
1856300	1858940	Oh look, you made a mess in my police department.
1858940	1860100	I come in behind John.
1860100	1864020	I'm not, I'm just literally at his back talking over him.
1864020	1864860	Who are you?
1864860	1868460	Men, it seems that I have found myself
1868460	1872100	the contention police officers that I am here to talk to.
1872100	1874100	If you would come on down
1874100	1877140	and reach into my jacket pocket here,
1877140	1878860	I think we won't have an issue
1878860	1880300	when you see, oh, it's a badge.
1880300	1881620	It's not a gun, it's a badge.
1881620	1883100	I do.
1883100	1884460	John, you keep your gun on him.
1884460	1886500	I also have my gun aimed at him.
1886500	1887500	I'm heading over there
1887500	1889180	and I'm reaching for the thing in my pocket
1889180	1891140	as I go for his penis.
1891140	1892180	The thing in your pocket?
1892180	1893020	Yeah.
1893020	1893860	The penis.
1893860	1894680	Okay, oh shit, yeah.
1894680	1896180	Okay, as you.
1896180	1898300	And I'm going, I wanna see his badge.
1898300	1901580	Okay, so you reach in just right there.
1901580	1902700	Yes, it's that one.
1902700	1904700	And you pull an FBI badge.
1904700	1906940	As soon as I see it, I point up
1907780	1910820	and shoot into the bottom neck area.
1910820	1912340	Okay.
1912340	1915060	All right, let's go ahead and roll.
1915060	1917260	If you could roll a firearms check for me.
1919000	1920780	Pass, 43 on an 80.
1920780	1922780	All right, and he rolled an aught four,
1922780	1924000	which means that you win.
1924000	1925500	So yours is higher and passed.
1925500	1926860	So describe what happened.
1926860	1928500	Real quick, what were you competing on there?
1928500	1931600	I used his alertness to see if he would recognize
1931600	1934820	that it was coming in order to even try
1934820	1936140	to resist the attack.
1936180	1937020	Gotcha, okay.
1937020	1938700	We don't talk about mechanics very much.
1938700	1941660	I typically just roll, but yes, ask that more often.
1941660	1943660	And I can always explain what I'm doing.
1943660	1945260	I don't think that was a listener thing.
1945260	1946100	That was just for me.
1946100	1947060	Yeah, absolutely.
1947060	1948500	I don't think anybody's gonna give a shit, but.
1948500	1950860	I don't think the people who listen to this will care.
1950860	1952900	If you give a shit, don't listen to us.
1952900	1955700	Yeah, we are barely playing by rules.
1955700	1957620	Oh, I am always cheating.
1960360	1965360	Yeah, I rolled a critical success every time.
1965720	1966720	High tension moment.
1966720	1968340	So what happens?
1968340	1972680	So I shoot and you guys see a little tranquilizer dart
1973560	1974520	hit him.
1974520	1975960	I hope it's really quick acting.
1975960	1980960	He goes, oh my God, what in the world is going on?
1982080	1986640	As he like starts to wobble and wobble
1986640	1988540	and then he looks at you and he's like,
1990920	1994440	hey, what's up?
1994440	1995280	I look at the badge.
1995280	1996120	What's the name on it?
1996120	2000260	Agent Chad, Trent Chad, Trent Chad.
2000260	2003400	Hey, hey, Chad, are you with me?
2005000	2005880	I'm gonna need you to sit down
2005880	2007800	and I kind of help him sit in the nearby chair.
2007800	2009240	I love sitting.
2010120	2011360	I turn back to John.
2011360	2013520	I'll explain, but get Keith in here.
2013520	2015940	Okay, my gun is on you now, by the way.
2015940	2017360	Trust me, John, please.
2017360	2018760	I do, you're Clark.
2018760	2021240	Yeah, I will come in like, what are you doing?
2021240	2022840	Wait, you got one of those for Rosemary?
2022840	2023680	Do we need it?
2024440	2026760	Yeah, hold on, what's going on here?
2026760	2027600	How many you got?
2027600	2029400	I think just one more.
2029400	2031840	Is that just a trink or like what'd you just do?
2031840	2033200	I'll explain to you guys.
2033200	2034040	We can just shoot her.
2034040	2035520	Here's what's going on.
2035520	2039960	I had a, I hope you guys will respect my privacy.
2039960	2040780	You're pretty.
2040780	2042400	But I had some stuff happen last night
2042400	2043780	and I just want you to trust me
2043780	2045300	that I got it on good authority
2045300	2047320	that the FBI was gonna be here this morning
2047320	2049200	and that it was our job to make sure
2049200	2051180	they didn't report back about all the crazy shit
2051180	2053000	that was happening here in contention.
2053040	2054360	You said good authority.
2054360	2057160	They gave me this gun, these tranq darts,
2057160	2059600	and they said that these darts are special
2059600	2061400	and whoever we tranq them with,
2061400	2063320	they'll have to obey our orders for a while.
2063320	2064160	Okay.
2064160	2066660	Do you know how long a while is, mechanically speaking?
2066660	2069120	I don't know it in world or mechanically.
2069120	2070520	I guess we'll just find out.
2071440	2073220	I think our best bet though is to give them
2073220	2075040	a bunch of instructions right the fuck now.
2075040	2077200	Do we have to fry and pan them over the head?
2078520	2080480	Well, hey man, that's really cool.
2080480	2081920	It's a really cool gun you got there.
2081920	2083680	What are we gonna tell them to do?
2083680	2085140	My only thought is just to make sure
2085140	2087140	he leaves and doesn't come back
2087140	2088900	and whatever he tells his superiors
2088900	2090900	is something that doesn't make them wanna come back.
2090900	2092800	Okay, man, as much as I wanna send him
2092800	2094820	on some hypnotized shenanigans,
2094820	2096320	I think that's probably the best bet.
2096320	2097760	Do you think that we'd have time
2097760	2100240	for shenanigans afterward?
2100240	2101160	Sure.
2102040	2103200	That's true.
2103200	2106360	Yeah, I was right behind you guys the whole time.
2106360	2108120	I told, buddy, I told you to get the Honda car.
2108120	2110840	Oh, yeah, I snuck in here, I guess, after.
2110840	2111800	Did you get upset when you saw
2111800	2113760	that your paperwork was all disturbed?
2113760	2116760	Well, you know how I like my desk to always be clean.
2116760	2118560	Hey, Drew, those papers over there,
2118560	2120280	are they all yours or some of them his?
2120280	2121600	Drew starts looking through.
2121600	2123820	He has pulled out tons of files
2123820	2126660	out of your filing cabinets and is sorting through them.
2126660	2127500	They're all ours, though.
2127500	2128320	Yeah.
2128320	2129400	So, hey, buddy, who sent you here?
2129400	2132320	Yeah, the FBI.
2132320	2135160	And what did they tell you you might find here?
2135160	2138400	Three of the worst police officers
2138400	2141880	in the history of the United States of America.
2141880	2144860	I guess that's, I guess that's you guys.
2144860	2147040	I wouldn't normally take immense offense to that,
2147040	2150720	but I understand that in today's law enforcement,
2150720	2153240	it's often more of a PR game than anything,
2153240	2156240	and frankly, we've been within' that pretty mightily.
2156240	2157700	So you might not know what we're doin'
2157700	2159160	to actually save the world.
2159160	2161280	I think we're probably the best police officers
2161280	2162920	in America, I would say.
2162920	2165000	Hey, Chad, you ever, certainly the bravest.
2165000	2168000	Have you ever conducted a press conference?
2168520	2170840	You ever conducted a press conference for yourself?
2170840	2175120	Press conferences are my specialty.
2175120	2176780	Guys, what if we have him calm down?
2176780	2177620	The popular is awesome.
2177620	2179200	Yes, Chad.
2179200	2181880	I'm very good with public relations.
2181880	2185480	Everyone loves me all the time, mostly.
2185480	2186600	Why wouldn't they?
2186600	2187440	Yep.
2187440	2189160	Yeah, so can you relate to the public for us?
2189160	2191080	What should we tell him that is goin' on, then?
2191080	2193240	What if we, oh, shit.
2193240	2196000	Well, what we'll tell him is that there has been,
2196000	2201000	well, it's super dark, but here's a possible,
2202240	2204260	here's a possible cover story.
2204260	2206280	All right, we tell them that contention
2206280	2209080	is a crossroads for human trafficking,
2209080	2210920	and that all their children and people
2210920	2214280	that then disappeared are in slavery.
2214280	2216720	Yeah, so what he's gonna say is that the FBI
2216720	2219200	has a task force on the way.
2219200	2223400	The meager resources of the contention PD were overwhelmed,
2223440	2227200	despite the brave efforts of all the officers here,
2227200	2232080	and that if you see anything, like black goo-related,
2232080	2234560	why don't you just call on in to Drew down here
2234560	2237380	at the hotline and let him know?
2238880	2240600	Maybe not the black goo.
2240600	2241960	Maybe not the black goo.
2241960	2244120	Maybe just the stuff flattering us.
2244120	2246960	We could tell him to give the contention PD
2246960	2248200	as wide a berth as possible,
2248200	2250200	that they are still part of the task force
2250200	2252400	and are the feet on the ground.
2252800	2254040	Don't interfere with us.
2254040	2255900	We should also say we're working closely
2255900	2257560	with the first church of contention.
2257560	2258400	I had a wiper.
2258400	2260840	I was thinking we might have a conference at the church.
2260840	2262000	Yeah.
2262000	2263080	Clark, you are.
2263080	2263920	That's good.
2263920	2264880	You're a genius.
2264880	2268640	Clark is a, he's kinda rocking back on his heels,
2268640	2270720	a little bit proud of that.
2270720	2274560	So do we wanna have that untelevised event that he does
2274560	2277300	and then send him on his way back and say,
2277300	2279160	they got it under control,
2279160	2281120	or actually have the FBI come out here
2281120	2282480	and no, we don't want them to come.
2282480	2285440	No, I think we have them do the press conference
2285440	2287400	and then get the fuck out of town
2287400	2288680	and don't ever come back.
2288680	2289520	Don't ever come back.
2289520	2292760	Tell his superiors that it must have been a false alarm
2292760	2294920	that contention PD's got everything under control
2294920	2295760	in that town.
2295760	2297100	Bizarre internet hoax.
2297100	2297940	There you go.
2297940	2300280	It's just a attack on small town America.
2300280	2302260	What time do you guys wanna have this conference?
2302260	2303100	Cause we're gonna need to.
2303100	2303920	We should do it today.
2303920	2304760	What time is it right now?
2304760	2305600	Early.
2305600	2306700	It is super early.
2306700	2309600	It's like five in the morning, 4.30 in the morning.
2309600	2310440	You know what?
2310760	2312120	We don't know how much longer
2312120	2314220	these truth serum darts are gonna work.
2314220	2315060	Let's hold it.
2315060	2315880	Whatever you wanna call it.
2315880	2317220	A 10 a.m. press conference.
2317220	2318060	I'm hoping.
2318060	2318880	No, no, no, no.
2318880	2319920	What we gotta do is go down to that church
2319920	2322120	right the fuck now, get up on the auditorium,
2322120	2324520	film one of them on our smartphones
2324520	2326320	and get him out of here.
2326320	2327160	And then go back to business.
2327160	2328720	I don't think it should be filmed though.
2328720	2330040	That's not a bad idea if we film it
2330040	2332960	and just give it to the local television station
2332960	2334040	on the morning news.
2334040	2336900	We can pose in front all Mr. Science theater style,
2336900	2339520	just silhouetted acting like reporters.
2339520	2340840	Hank, question.
2340840	2343060	Clark is already heading toward the evidence locker
2343060	2346100	to find the camera that we always use for filming things.
2347080	2347920	Okay.
2347920	2348760	Absolutely.
2348760	2349580	I like that.
2349580	2350420	And then we'll send it into.
2350420	2351260	When you go back there.
2351260	2355460	What is the local news channel?
2355460	2357240	We probably just get the city news out here.
2357240	2358600	Yeah, that's right.
2358600	2359720	We're only an hour away.
2359720	2362640	Probably the only news around is the city.
2362640	2364080	Well, there's probably a couple radio.
2364080	2366800	I mean, of course there's a couple radio stations
2366800	2368080	that we all listen to and love.
2368080	2369180	Local talk radio.
2369700	2370540	Oh, let's do that.
2370540	2372020	Let's do a public service announcement on the radio.
2372020	2375700	You could even have Wolf the dog post it.
2375700	2376540	Yeah.
2376540	2378260	Well, everybody in town loves Wolf the dog.
2378260	2379340	That's true.
2379340	2380620	Okay, I like the idea.
2380620	2382140	All right, let's get this done quick.
2382140	2383580	We can just record it right here then.
2383580	2384420	Yep.
2384420	2385380	All right, say this idiot.
2385380	2386220	What?
2386220	2389220	Drew, top up something pretty for this dumb ass to say.
2389220	2391540	Okay, what the fuck?
2392900	2393740	I have to do it all.
2393740	2394580	No, you have to do it all.
2394580	2397540	I don't know if it's necessary that we even say anything
2397580	2399300	because we've said what he's gonna say.
2399300	2403180	The bullet points that we wanna hit are everything's okay,
2403180	2406580	let the contention PD do whatever the fuck they want.
2406580	2408500	And don't worry, everything's gonna be all right.
2408500	2411620	And that everything the contention PD has been doing
2411620	2415560	has been a-okay, what we needed them to do.
2415560	2416740	Above and beyond.
2416740	2418740	Don't worry, but be careful out there.
2418740	2420220	Yep.
2420220	2421480	So we have him say that.
2421480	2422320	Yeah.
2422320	2423140	Awesome.
2423140	2426100	We can have Drew email it over to Wolf the dog.
2426100	2427020	For immediate release.
2427460	2429140	Yeah, for immediate release.
2429140	2429980	Yeah.
2429980	2433380	Haven't played a couple times over the course of the day.
2433380	2434220	Perfect.
2434220	2435040	Well, cause that's the thing,
2435040	2436860	this is gonna be a big news.
2436860	2437780	They're gonna want this.
2437780	2438620	They're not gonna want it.
2438620	2439440	This is hot shit.
2439440	2440280	They're not gonna want it.
2440280	2441120	Hot shit.
2441120	2444780	Well, they've been waiting to hear something from you guys.
2444780	2446740	That was mostly Drew's fault.
2446740	2448460	Oh, and tell them to repeat it.
2448460	2449420	Oh, hey, yeah.
2449420	2452280	Should we have somebody else besides Drew email him?
2452280	2453420	Remember when he didn't tell us
2453420	2455760	about those 30 missing people?
2455760	2457840	I think his heart's in the right place, but.
2457840	2458860	Well, you guys are right here.
2458860	2459700	You can watch me.
2459700	2461560	We can all email them together.
2461560	2463760	Drew, the whole point of your job
2463760	2465180	is that you're supposed to be able to do it
2465180	2466400	while we're not watching you.
2466400	2471400	Yes, and that was an excellent opportunity for this story.
2471600	2474760	Well, you can prove yourself to us by doing it correctly.
2474760	2476600	And how about you get dressed?
2476600	2477440	Yeah, buddy.
2477440	2479840	And let's do the next thing.
2479840	2480680	Retroactively.
2480680	2482200	As soon as agent is done recording.
2482200	2483040	Can we start over?
2483040	2483880	Can we start over?
2483880	2485480	As soon as the agent is done recording
2486040	2487600	and maybe those two are getting the emails sent off,
2487600	2489120	I'm telling them about.
2489120	2492440	And now I'm gonna need you to go back to your superiors
2492440	2494780	and tell them kind of what you said on that news broadcast,
2494780	2497560	that everything's okay here in the contention area.
2497560	2498400	Yeah.
2498400	2501580	And that there's no reason to send anybody else down here
2501580	2502720	for a while at least,
2502720	2504580	but you probably never need them again.
2504580	2505880	It's just an internet hoax.
2505880	2506920	So I did it?
2506920	2507960	I did it right?
2507960	2509840	I just solved the case, buddy.
2509840	2510840	I pat him on the back.
2510840	2511660	You did.
2511660	2512500	You did.
2512500	2513340	You killed him.
2513340	2514160	And he was your boss.
2514160	2515000	I'd give you a promotion.
2515520	2516360	You look strong and energized.
2516360	2518000	You look swole, buddy.
2518000	2519200	Thank you.
2519200	2520280	Look at them wings.
2520280	2521880	I appreciate it.
2521880	2525880	I'll just go get in my car.
2525880	2526840	Hey, wait, real quick.
2526840	2527920	Before you fucking go,
2527920	2529640	could you mop up that Red Bull you spilled?
2529640	2530880	Yeah, of course.
2530880	2532440	All right, thanks, you dumb piece of shit.
2532440	2533880	And then I shoot him dead.
2536720	2540360	Oh no, we're gonna have to lure another FBI agent down here
2540360	2542040	and hypnotize him all over again.
2542880	2545720	And he's gonna have to clean up this mess.
2547440	2549360	No, I don't shoot him.
2549360	2550880	I failed my firearm, shit.
2551960	2555440	Clark, when you go to the back of the police station
2555440	2557980	to grab your change of clothes,
2557980	2562060	you have a habit of peeking in on the cells.
2564200	2565680	There's no one in the cells.
2565680	2567040	Dr. Murray Jacobs is gone.
2567040	2570820	Dr. Murray Jacobs and the body of Doug Jacobs
2570820	2573440	are no longer in the cells.
2573440	2575180	Are all our artifacts still there?
2575180	2577940	The cell doors are locked.
2577940	2581220	I do the cartoon walk by and then slowly walk back.
2584220	2586420	And you confirm.
2586420	2587260	No one's there.
2587260	2589220	Hey, boys, I'm still gonna get changed,
2589220	2592480	but cells are empty, God fucking damn it.
2592480	2593900	I go back and get changed.
2593900	2596780	But just the people are gone, not our stuff.
2596780	2597740	The stuff is in a locker.
2597740	2599740	The stuff is in the evidence room, I think.
2599740	2600580	None of us let them out.
2600580	2602560	Just look for yourself as I kind of motion
2602560	2603740	with a hand over toward them.
2603740	2605860	Okay, we go check it out.
2605860	2608460	Hey, Clark, did you notice that everybody's gone?
2609860	2611040	I don't respond.
2611980	2612820	Put my clothes on.
2612820	2613820	What the fuck?
2613820	2618260	I check the doors to make sure that they're actually locked.
2618260	2619540	They're locked and secured.
2619540	2622140	Well, this is a quandary.
2622140	2624000	I come back into the room fully dressed.
2624000	2626080	Oh, hey, I check the locks.
2626080	2628540	I tried Murray Jacobs' cell phone number,
2628540	2633340	which I assume we acquired during routine police paperwork.
2633340	2634620	Yeah, that flies.
2634620	2637380	It goes to voicemail immediately, it doesn't ring.
2637380	2638220	I turn to Drew.
2638220	2640380	Hey, Drew, when was the last time you noticed them in there?
2640380	2642540	Well, they were in there last night.
2642540	2644420	Isn't it last night right now?
2644420	2646980	Well, they were in there like seven hours ago, for sure.
2646980	2648980	Well, it's a good thing we're in a police station
2648980	2651260	with cameras, let's go check those.
2651260	2652100	Nice.
2652100	2653280	A fist bump, Keith.
2654280	2658520	Watching the security footage of the last couple of hours
2658520	2663200	fast forwarding through, you see the cat in your police station
2663200	2666960	running all over the place, constantly jumping, jumping,
2666960	2670120	jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping from spot to spot
2670120	2672760	to spot, hiding, running, running.
2672760	2677520	And when you are watching the footage of the cells,
2677520	2681280	you see both Dr. Murray Jacobs and the body
2681320	2686520	of Doug Jacobs silently just get really scared
2686520	2688480	and move back up against the wall,
2688480	2690360	and they start kind of moving away.
2690360	2695000	And then all of a sudden, you see their bodies picked up
2695000	2697760	off the ground and slammed into the ground
2697760	2699820	and slammed into the ground.
2699820	2704520	And then as if they were never there, they are gone.
2704520	2706600	What the hell could that have been?
2706600	2709120	If you guys could go ahead and roll sanity.
2709120	2710400	Do we need to?
2710440	2712360	That's a really good point, because you have seen this
2712360	2713960	happen a lot of times.
2713960	2716360	We just know what it is, but I pass anyway.
2717640	2720000	And especially because it was also on camera,
2720000	2721880	I won't call for a sanity roll there.
2721880	2725200	I want to rewind the tape and get to the very moment
2725200	2727480	that the cat started freaking out and see if I can tell
2727480	2730120	which direction it was looking when it started freaking out.
2730120	2731200	Interesting.
2731200	2733000	Did the cat get gooed too?
2733000	2735120	You didn't see the cat disappear.
2735120	2739120	As you're finding the spot where the cat got freaked out,
2739120	2740260	it was looking up.
2741660	2742520	I look up.
2742520	2747120	You see the paneled ceiling of the police department.
2747120	2749280	You know, the kind of ceiling that they have in classrooms
2749280	2750600	that you can throw pencils into.
2750600	2751440	Drop ceiling.
2751440	2752280	Drop ceiling.
2752280	2753100	Drop ceiling.
2753100	2756600	So, hey, y'all remember when the body of John Peters
2756600	2759800	fell from the sky onto my cop cruiser?
2759800	2760640	Do you think?
2760640	2761480	Oh, yeah.
2761480	2762320	Mm-hmm.
2762320	2763160	I don't know.
2763160	2765920	That happened up, you know what I mean?
2765920	2766920	The sky opened.
2766920	2768320	Well, I mean, that happened.
2768840	2769720	Cat was looking up.
2769720	2771360	Happened in the junkyard body.
2771360	2772640	Happened.
2772640	2773900	We're not talking about the slamming.
2773900	2775600	Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
2775600	2778040	Is that, yeah, the falling from the sky is.
2778040	2779480	Yeah, the falling from the sky.
2779480	2782560	Is different, but they got smashed repeatedly
2782560	2784920	into the ground and then disappeared.
2784920	2787320	Julie Maxwell and Leo Piston.
2787320	2790120	Got smashed into the ground and then disappeared.
2790120	2790960	John Peters.
2790960	2795280	John Peters fell from the sky and did not disappear.
2795280	2798360	The first body fell and didn't disappear.
2798360	2799400	Good work, yep.
2799400	2800520	Very succinctly put, Keith.
2800520	2801360	Thank you.
2801360	2804000	Seems like we might be dealing with the same.
2804000	2805640	Do you think it's all the same goo?
2805640	2807240	Probably all the same goo.
2808160	2811840	And we, did we figure out,
2811840	2814400	we think that the animals can see the goo?
2814400	2815240	Well, they can sense it.
2815240	2819280	Animals have a pretty natural awareness.
2819280	2820800	What if we all turn into cats?
2822040	2824360	Clark, right now, I think that's best case scenario.
2824360	2827600	And then we could just run free, John.
2827600	2828560	Well, I think we're gonna have to wait
2828560	2830920	till the radio turns back on.
2831920	2833960	We're gonna have to wait till the radio turns back on
2833960	2837400	to test that theory out.
2837400	2839600	I kind of do a sheepish laugh.
2840520	2841360	We can't do that.
2841360	2844240	Real quick, I don't know how any of this all works,
2844240	2847440	but I was thinking about, I think at some point,
2847440	2849320	one of us is probably gonna have to shoot ourselves
2849320	2851200	with that gun to go to this other place
2851200	2852760	where all this weird shit and those photographs
2852800	2853960	are coming from.
2853960	2856200	And then maybe the radio, or the helmet.
2856200	2858120	One of them, I think there's a sequence maybe
2858120	2860600	that takes you there and brings you back.
2860600	2863200	But I'm not sure what swapping bodies has to do with it.
2863200	2864040	Maybe one of us has to die.
2864040	2866720	Well, we'll be able to take a picture again today.
2868480	2869920	Why?
2869920	2872520	I don't know why.
2872520	2876280	So, you think it's on a daily timer?
2876280	2877280	Why did you say that?
2877280	2879360	Did you have some kind of weird dream about that?
2879360	2881040	I don't know, I just, it was,
2881040	2882660	I felt like that was just in my mind.
2883500	2884340	I don't know how I knew that.
2884340	2886940	So, something I was thinking about is the last time.
2886940	2888660	I think maybe around one o'clock today,
2888660	2890480	we'll be able to take that picture.
2890480	2892140	That's specific, Keith.
2892140	2894820	It's just, it's in my mind, it's a hunch.
2894820	2896060	I don't know how I know it, though.
2896060	2899060	Yeah, all right, what the hell do you know, buddy?
2899060	2901980	Hey, Keith rolled to be a better liar.
2901980	2904780	Keith rolled to lie to us right now.
2904780	2906620	Is it weird shit?
2906620	2909060	I don't know, I just, it popped into my head.
2909060	2911120	I put my hand on Keith's shoulder.
2911600	2912900	Weird shit is all around us, man.
2912900	2915120	If you just happen to know this, I fucking believe you, man.
2915120	2916380	I just knew it.
2916380	2918520	I don't know, I can't remember how or what.
2918520	2919640	Did we not all know that?
2919640	2922120	Can I do a hument to see if he's lying about
2922120	2923120	just knowing that?
2923120	2926760	I don't like to play where you can roll hument
2926760	2928400	against other players.
2928400	2930260	Oh, so Luke just gets the bullshit.
2930260	2934400	We've also, so early on, there was a time I played
2934400	2937200	with a different group and somebody had an incredibly
2937200	2941480	high Persuade and they just forced Dean's player
2941480	2945700	to keep doing stupid stuff by rolling Persuade against him.
2947200	2948640	Yeah, that doesn't sound fun.
2948640	2949480	I mean, it sounds fun.
2949480	2951520	No, it's objectively the worst scenario.
2951520	2952440	That's a really good point about, yeah.
2952440	2957120	It was really funny for everyone except for Dean.
2958000	2960800	Which is annoying, I'd be like, okay, well,
2960800	2962320	you can just play my character then.
2962320	2965040	Yeah, so I don't like it.
2965040	2967040	What are the recourses for discovering
2967040	2968460	if a player is lying to you?
2968460	2969300	What do you think?
2969300	2970680	Well, I was about to say, if you want to play it out.
2970680	2973180	I've kind of just said that I believe him.
2973180	2974960	Yeah, so let's role play it.
2974960	2976400	You can not believe me if you don't want.
2976400	2978080	I don't believe that you just don't.
2978080	2980200	I think you got more you're not telling us.
2980200	2981040	Well, that's-
2981040	2983320	Is there any reason why you're not telling us?
2983320	2984880	Honestly, it just popped in my head.
2984880	2988080	I thought maybe, did we not already know?
2988080	2990920	You know, I might be wrong even, let's just see.
2990920	2992920	Let me go check and see, is it red still?
2992920	2995840	You guys walk into the evidence locker
2995840	3000400	and you see the helmet and it's light is red.
3000400	3003120	You see the camera, it's light is red.
3003120	3005680	You see the gun, it's light is red.
3005680	3008320	And you see the radio and it's light is green.
3009640	3010480	Oh!
3010480	3011360	Oh!
3040480	3041320	Oh!
3070480	3071320	Oh!
