0	5000	Welcome, my children, to the family reunion that is PTBP.
5860	9140	It's your Auntie Wolf here to talk your ear off
9140	13340	while feeding you some room temp potato salad.
13340	17380	If your potato salad ain't wet and milky,
17380	19300	you're making it wrong.
19300	23300	I'm feeding you live from 694.2.
23300	27080	I think maybe from Ocean City still.
27080	29860	I don't know, man, I ain't looked outside in a minute.
29860	33660	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Rob in Atlanta.
33660	34700	Rob writes,
34700	39000	"'Mornin', Wolf, big fan Rob callin' in from the city.
39000	42580	"'In my last year of law school, I gotta tell you,
42580	45200	"'it's wild how often local officers

84280	88440	"'I bet y'all would get along together real nice.

125920	129840	"'Doctor, doctor, give me the news.
129840	132860	"'There are two pieces of evidence in this case
132860	137360	"'against Arvin Chilton that just don't add up to this Wolf.

241640	245960	And when my ears pop and the shell shock

249960	253920	I'll be all right, I can go there,
253920	258080	now that I've stared death in the face.

272960	273800	Hey, hey!

282360	287360	Everybody now, bing bong, roly jays, bing bong, roly jays.
287480	289480	So do you guys remember back in,
289480	291520	oh gosh, how long ago was this?
291520	294080	There was a few years ago where suddenly
294080	296520	everyone that Taylor and I knew from college,
296520	297680	Taylor being my wife,
297680	299280	for those of you who are new to listening,
299280	301040	you can see her guest appearing
301040	302960	in certain parts of the podcast
302960	305300	in season one and pretending to be b-ball.
305940	307300	Uh, but-
307300	308740	Was that a reference to season one?
308740	309580	God, no!
309580	310900	You said no references.
310900	312940	Ah, no references to season one.
312940	315020	So when Taylor and I were younger,
315980	319440	we're 29 now, when we were probably 25,
319440	321580	a lot of people here that we knew from college
321580	324000	in Springfield, Missouri started getting married,
324000	327300	and I was supposed to dress for weddings,
327300	329620	and I didn't have any fucking money at all,
329620	333820	and so I was like, basically what would happen
333820	336380	is I didn't have clothes to wear to a wedding,
336380	339460	so every single time I got invited to a wedding,
339460	341900	I would go to Kohl's,
341900	346100	because Kohl's has an insane return policy,
346100	349740	a very, very good lax return policy,
349740	353420	and so I would go and I would get a nice tie
353420	357140	or a nice suit coat or whatever I needed
357140	358940	to go to this wedding.
358940	361780	I actually, I said tie, but I never wear ties,
361780	365860	but I remember specifically for this story,
365860	368660	I got a new suit jacket from Kohl's,
368660	372420	a nice discount suit jacket that looked nice on me,
372420	375020	and then I wore it to this wedding,
375020	377280	and this wedding was actually really fun,
377280	381060	but it was one of Taylor's friends from a long time,
381060	383940	family, friends from an early age.
383940	385980	Zach, I just wanna get one thing clear real quick.
385980	387020	Yeah, hit me with it.
387020	387900	You lied about the tie.
387900	389140	How much of the rest of this is a lie?
389140	390220	Oh, all of it.
390220	391060	Yeah.
391060	396060	I was all set up, and so I went to this wedding,
397500	399880	and I didn't know anyone there,
399880	403700	and Taylor was in this group of four girls.
403700	405260	She was one of the bridesmaids,
405260	408520	and they were just having the time of their life
408520	412160	all reminiscing about when they were growing up together,
412160	417160	and I was pretty lit and did the photo booth by myself.
417160	420160	And did the photo booth by myself.
420160	421000	Well, it.
423240	424720	So there was a photo booth there
424720	426440	that would take four pictures of you
426440	429500	and then spit out a little image there
429500	431360	like you might in a photo booth,
431360	433380	and there were lots of little props there,
433380	437600	so I put on four different hats and just stared ominously
438660	442980	directly into the camera with the saddest face
442980	444320	that I could muster,
444360	447960	and so I had this amazing group of four pictures of me
447960	451220	in this looking fresh in this Kohl's suit,
452120	454240	and I took these pictures, and I was like,
454240	457160	man, I am gonna love these pictures forever,
457160	460080	and I stuck them in the inside pocket of my suit jacket,
460080	463280	and then I returned that jacket to Kohl's,
463280	465320	and as soon as I walked out the door,
465320	466760	I thought, oh no,
468520	472760	there is a picture of me inside of the pocket of that jacket
472760	475800	and not only is it just a weird set of four pictures
475800	480680	of a guy by himself looking sad as possible,
480680	481800	he's wearing that suit jacket.
481800	484640	But he's wearing the jacket that you just bought, yeah.
484640	486380	At least it looks like you're having a bad time
486380	487220	in that jacket.
487220	491600	Right, so if the Kohl's return person found it,
491600	493000	they would be like, oh, well, I see.
493000	493840	I see.
493840	494660	He did not enjoy the jacket.
494660	496200	He had a bad time.
496200	499480	This jacket would only bring forth negative memories
499480	501640	for this saddeman, but if he did,
501640	503240	just like throw it back on the rack,
503240	505520	somebody had the biggest mind fuck.
505520	507480	Yeah, straight up.
507480	508320	Maybe not.
508320	510000	They probably realized immediately what had happened.
510000	511360	That's weird that my suit jacket
511360	513000	is coming with stock photos.
515040	518400	Of a sad man in this jacket?
518400	520020	This kid looks poor.
521680	522800	They would have said,
522800	526500	based on how scraggly my beard probably was.
527680	528520	Yep.
529160	530720	Yep.
530720	533120	You were a great big fat person back then, right?
535240	537040	Buffalo Bill would have liked you.
538080	538920	Nope, nope.
538920	539760	No, that's just for us.
539760	541280	I am not editing that out.
541280	542480	No, do take out the body shaming.
542480	545760	That's just because we watched Silence of the Lambs.
545760	548800	Literally, then it makes sense for this exact moment.
548800	550800	I know, and you were a great big fat person.
550800	555800	I quit drinking soda
556200	559840	and I quit drinking Tom Collins' every night,
559840	563720	which at the time, for some reason, my mind was like,
563720	566000	I don't understand how every night
566000	571000	when I drink three pint-sized gin and tonics
571680	576680	with extra syrupy lime juice poured on top of it,
576800	579600	I don't understand why I'm getting so fat.
580800	581640	Yep.
582600	584080	So much sugar.
584080	586400	The calories in a drink will get to you, folks.
586400	587880	Yeah, but the calories in a drink
587880	592880	that's also filled with syrupy sugar is also no bueno.
593200	598000	I was literally putting simple syrup and sugary lime juice
598000	600620	in a drink that already had tonic water in it
600620	604600	because at the time, I didn't know that tonic water
604600	606440	already had a bunch of sugar in it.
606440	608120	Like as much as a soda.
608120	608960	That's why it's good.
608960	610120	That's why it's so fucking good.
611040	613400	Ah, so now I just drink beer.
613400	617680	It's honest, you know?
619240	620320	It is what it is.
620320	621880	Beer, for when you're counting calories.
621880	623040	It's fermented.
623040	624760	You can count a whole lot of them.
626060	627840	If you're practicing this well.
627840	629780	Saw a tweet that said I'm Midwest sober,
629780	632200	which means I'm just drinking beer these days.
632200	633680	Holy shit.
633680	635520	There was a, in Mad Men,
635520	639280	there was this guy like peed himself before a meeting
639280	641160	and they're like, you gotta go to rehab.
641160	643040	And one guy was like, yeah, I know,
643040	645520	so and so went to rehab and he only drinks beer now,
645520	646480	so he's doing good.
648400	649240	That actor.
649240	650060	Isn't that Brian Doyle Murphy?
650060	651480	Yeah, he was in God Bless America.
651480	652440	Brian Doyle Murray.
652440	654720	And that movie fucking rules.
654720	656720	Yeah, it does.
656720	657560	It really does.
657560	658380	Right, it does rule.
658380	659220	It's fucked up.
659220	660060	You know what?
660060	660880	I haven't seen it in a long time.
660880	661720	You're right, it might suck.
661720	662560	I don't know, it might suck.
662560	664480	I only recognize that guy from Shameless.
664480	666120	He played like a cuck.
666120	669200	He played William H. Macy in Shameless.
670020	670860	It's Bill Murray's brother.
670860	671680	Yeah, he's Bill Murray's brother.
671680	672520	What?
672520	674880	Yeah, guys, he's pretty famous.
674880	677100	Not Bill Murray famous, but sure.
677100	678160	I don't think it is.
678160	679320	The guy that I'm thinking of?
679320	681800	If you're thinking of Brian Doyle Murray, then it is.
681800	682640	If you're thinking of the guy
682640	684480	who pisses pants in Mad Men, that is.
684480	686480	That's not Brian Doyle Murray, is it?
686480	687320	Yeah, it is.
687320	688140	Yeah, it totally is.
688140	688980	Hold on.
688980	690000	What's his character's name in that?
690000	690840	And that's his whole deal,
690840	692460	is that he's the fun drunk guy, right?
692460	694280	Until it becomes too much of a problem.
694280	696700	Yeah, this guy's not in Mad Men.
696700	697540	The guy you're thinking of?
697540	698360	So that's what I was gonna say.
698400	699240	It's his other brother.
699240	700760	Look up Bill Murray's brothers.
700760	701600	Other brother.
701600	702420	Yeah.
702420	705640	He's another brother, and they eat nutter butters.
705640	706480	Butter, butter.
706480	707320	Dude, nutter butter.
707320	709040	I fuck with a nutter butter.
709040	709880	Yeah, dude.
709880	711520	For some reason, on the outside of a nutter butter.
711520	712360	Joel Murray.
712360	714280	Hold on, I'm talking about nutter butter.
714280	715920	I didn't know that was Bill Murray's brother.
715920	718880	Oh shit, I thought Joel Murray was Brian Doyle Murray.
718880	722520	Oh, this whole time it was Joel, not Brian Doyle?
722520	726360	Yeah, Joel is in Mad Men, and God bless America.
726360	727200	God bless America.
727200	728120	Yes, yeah.
728720	729760	What were you saying, though?
729760	731200	Before I rudely interrupted.
731200	733400	He was waxing poetic about nutter butters.
734320	735160	Oh, nice.
735160	737460	It's the sugar crystals on the outside
737460	740240	that really do it for me, if I'm being completely wrong.
740240	742920	There is nothing more horrifying
742920	744520	than listening to a podcast,
744520	747200	and you know that the hosts are incorrect.
748720	750200	And they keep saying the thing.
750200	753960	If I knew who Joel Murray was in my heart,
753960	755220	I would hate this.
755620	760200	Good, let's give him some negative feels,
760200	762980	because we are dealing with some very
762980	765820	unsettling situations here.
765820	768820	Wait, what are the peanut chocolate peanut butter?
768820	769760	Nutter butters.
769760	771140	Wafer things?
771140	774020	Oh, I know exactly.
774020	774860	Oh.
774860	775700	What are those called?
775700	776620	Fuck.
776620	778260	I like those more than nutter butters,
778260	779580	but I do like nutter butters.
779580	782420	Oh, chocolate.
782420	783380	Are those puffer nutters?
783380	784220	Peanut.
784220	785040	No.
785860	786700	Wafers.
786700	787540	What the fuck?
787540	789240	Are called nutty buddies.
789240	790440	Nutty buddies, yeah.
790440	791960	Or nutty bars.
791960	792800	Yeah, nutty buddies.
792800	794080	What the fuck is a nutter butter?
794080	795960	Nutter butters are shaped like a peanut, aren't they?
795960	798200	Yes, they are, and there's no chocolate.
798200	800700	And a fluffer nutter is marshmallow
800700	802100	and peanut butter sandwich.
802100	804400	Is that exactly what Elvis ate?
804400	807040	No, he liked something with peanut butter jelly
807040	807880	and bananas.
807880	810240	That's right, peanut butter, banana, and honey.
810240	811080	And honey.
811080	811900	And chocolate.
811900	813520	You're just the devil in disguise.
814160	816440	That's a fun Elvis song.
816440	817280	Thank you.
817280	820600	All right, let's get a recap of where we were at last time
820600	825160	because it's been one, I mean, we can let them in.
825160	827440	It's not been one week for us,
827440	829720	but it has been one week for the listener.
829720	831880	So let's give them a nice little recap
831880	836000	to get them in the mod for where we are now.
836000	838200	Shit's fucked up in Ocean City, New Jersey.
838200	839520	Yeah, it really is.
839520	842040	We got freaking, what's his first name?
842040	843040	Arvin Chilton.
843400	845960	We got an ex-Delta Green agent slicing up eyeballs.
845960	849440	That's right, and not slicing through the eyeballs.
849440	851300	Girl, you're so groovy.
851300	853880	I want you to know.
853880	854720	I don't know.
854720	855560	Slicing up eyeballs?
855560	856400	No, I don't know it.
856400	857220	Look, do you know it?
857220	860060	I am on chin and a Lucia.
861200	862360	Pixies, bro.
862360	863200	It's a Pixies song.
863200	864200	That's why I said it.
866800	868120	Cool.
868120	869440	Cool, yeah.
869440	870520	I read Fight Club.
871040	875440	That was, yeah, Frank Black's best book.
878040	879440	What's Kim's deal, though?
879440	881600	All right, so when you guys.
881600	882440	I get it.
882440	884480	Her deal is that she's in a better band.
886480	887320	Yeah.
887320	889200	Things are bad in Ocean City, New Jersey.
889200	890360	We got an ex-Delta Green agent
890360	892120	who's killing people close to him in his life.
892120	893880	Slicing up eyeballs.
893880	895200	Slicing up eyeballs.
895200	896480	Well, he's not slicing them up, though.
896480	897560	He removed them carefully.
897560	899740	He's taking them out real surgically.
899780	900620	We got down there.
900620	902100	We met up with an FBI agent
902100	904660	who pointed us toward his domicile,
904660	907180	and we went and talked to the landlord there.
907180	908800	He was kind of a weird guy,
908800	910620	and then I think it was him who recommended
910620	913300	we go over to a cafe and have a little lunch.
913300	915100	That was actually Mara Kinlan.
915100	915940	Oh, that's right.
915940	918620	We went back and talked to the NYPD who had been on this.
918620	920660	She was, yeah, she was Newark.
920660	921500	Newark.
921500	922340	Newark, yeah.
922340	923820	Did she give us anything good?
923820	926020	She disagreed with Uncle Jimmy
926020	928660	on the fact that Eileen McCarty,
928660	932800	he had this idea that Eileen McCarty was not the body
932800	934380	that was found in her own home
934380	937180	because she was seen by witnesses in two locations.
937180	939160	But she was like, it's definitely her.
939160	941540	Yeah, and then later, Agent Sparrow,
941540	945380	when she was looking over the actual high-res
945380	947860	like digital files from crime scene photos,
947860	950940	came to the same conclusion because Garza,
950940	952400	Uncle Jimmy with the FBI,
952400	954840	was using these like printed out-
954840	955680	Mayonnaise covered.
955680	957860	Mayonnaise covered crime scene photos.
957900	960300	Uncle Jimmy was, he was gross.
960300	961400	Yeah, he was gross.
961400	962240	He was gross.
962240	964780	Yeah, Agent Garza was pretty unprofessional.
964780	968660	We went to Arvin Chilton's apartment duplex,
968660	971140	which was above Alexander Duchesne's apartment.
971140	972500	Well done.
972500	973780	Who did that without notes?
973780	974620	I did.
974620	976100	I don't take notes, folks.
978200	979980	And we looked around.
979980	983300	He had a bunch of Shakespeare in his duplex.
983300	986580	And then we went downstairs and his landlord,
986580	988060	who lives below him,
988060	991580	had a copy of As I Lay Dying.
994340	996460	It was actually the things they carried.
996460	998300	Mother Faulkner and-
998300	1000220	He had a copy of That Thing You Do.
1001820	1004800	He had a copy of There's Something About Mary.
1004800	1007380	And it was clearly overdue from Blockbuster.
1007380	1008220	That's right.
1008220	1009060	Which still existed in 4060.
1009060	1013220	It was called Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
1013220	1015140	And we all sat down and watched it.
1015140	1017940	Luke, we literally sat down and had it on
1017940	1020220	before this started.
1020220	1021080	What's it called?
1023440	1024280	What's it start with?
1024280	1025100	As.
1025100	1026100	As I Lay Dying.
1028860	1029700	Band of the Book.
1029700	1030540	The book.
1030540	1032740	Or the James Franco adaptation of the novel.
1032740	1034300	That one.
1034300	1037580	No, his adaptation was the band of the band.
1037580	1039060	I didn't watch it for obvious reasons.
1039060	1041980	James Franco in the band As I Lay Dying.
1041980	1044460	As the world turns,
1045980	1050140	as you is mad.
1050140	1053220	As you imagined it.
1053220	1055420	Imagine dragging these balls on my face.
1056980	1060620	As you, I don't know what it was called.
1060620	1064220	I did look right at the title when we turned it on.
1064220	1066620	I know, and it's also a really famous Shakespeare play
1066620	1069260	that you've undoubtedly heard the title of
1069260	1071300	countless times in your life.
1071300	1073060	The Wind Flies.
1073060	1073900	I don't know what it is.
1073900	1075260	As the Crow Flows.
1075260	1076100	As You Like It.
1076100	1078540	As You Like It, as I said.
1078540	1080220	Do you like that?
1080220	1083340	I can't believe you made that great As They Lay Dying joke
1083340	1085260	without knowing what it was called.
1086620	1087460	I knew it was ads.
1087460	1089020	He had the ads, yeah.
1089020	1092060	Anyway, the landlord had a copy of that,
1092060	1093860	said that it was fitting,
1093860	1096940	and all of us having read that book play
1096940	1099700	and watch the college production of it.
1099700	1101720	We all pegged exactly what that meant, for sure.
1101720	1103500	Steely Dan was involved.
1104060	1106700	Pink, come back to me.
1106700	1107900	Anyway, he had a copy of that.
1107900	1108900	He said it was fitting,
1108900	1113180	and we knew that there's disguises involved in that book.
1113180	1115240	And he smelled like bandages.
1115240	1116080	What else did we find out?
1116080	1117620	Here's what's involved in that play,
1117620	1120900	is people pretending to be things that they're not.
1120900	1123500	People pretending to be other people.
1123500	1124420	Which we pointed out.
1124420	1126700	We already did the joke about our game,
1126700	1128300	so we're not gonna do that again.
1128300	1129820	We've done that.
1129820	1130660	Get over it.
1130660	1131480	But that is,
1132360	1133520	but that's the gist of it.
1133520	1138520	There's also some rural urban class friction themes.
1138640	1139480	It's pretty good.
1139480	1142600	I watched 30 minutes of it and then read the synopsis.
1144360	1145760	What else happened?
1145760	1147520	That's when we went over to the cafe,
1147520	1148640	and the waitress said,
1148640	1150720	man, there's this weird graffiti around the corner.
1150720	1151960	You should take a peek at it.
1151960	1154280	And boy, was it some weird graffiti.
1154280	1157680	Yeah, and we got really lucky with a critical role
1157680	1160080	that allowed us to season three.
1160080	1161840	I don't listen to that nerd shit.
1161840	1162680	I don't either.
1164200	1166360	That allowed us to recognize
1166360	1168720	it as a symbol of the Testament of New Flesh,
1168720	1173160	which is an organization obsessed with magic.
1174840	1177000	They chant in Aklo, a pre-human language.
1177000	1178440	Aklo language.
1178440	1183440	Yeah, and they worship some sort of eternal and elder being.
1184560	1187120	Oh shit, is this gonna be real Cthulhu?
1187120	1188120	Are we gonna meet Cthulhu?
1188120	1189160	Do you wanna meet Cthulhu?
1189160	1190080	I wanna meet Cthulhu.
1190080	1191600	We have in a campaign, haven't we?
1191600	1194600	Yeah, we had Cthulhu end one of our campaigns.
1194600	1195440	That's true.
1195440	1197680	Joe's character was on the beach looking out.
1197680	1198520	Yeah.
1199600	1200880	Yeah, that was pretty rad.
1202400	1204840	As Cthulhu just rose up.
1204840	1207480	Weren't the minions lifting me in the air?
1207480	1211200	The star spawn were lifting you up into the air
1211200	1212040	off the beach.
1212040	1213320	The minions from Despicable Me.
1213320	1214520	The minions from Despicable Me.
1214520	1216280	Stuart was there.
1216280	1217480	Kevin, Bob.
1217520	1219280	Yeah, all the classics.
1219280	1220120	I was gonna say,
1220120	1225120	I would rather have run into the Testament of Nude Flesh.
1229880	1232120	That's clever.
1234440	1235280	Cause you horny?
1235280	1236360	Cause I'm horny.
1238360	1239880	Everybody out there.
1239880	1242640	I'm really glad that out of all the different characters
1242640	1246520	that you guys have made for games that I've run for you,
1246520	1248080	none of you have ever been like,
1248080	1251320	and my character is horny.
1252720	1254880	If you wanna flirt with me,
1254880	1256200	you can do it out of game.
1258120	1259800	That's my rule.
1259800	1260720	Is that where we ended?
1260720	1261560	No.
1261560	1262400	What happened next?
1262400	1264480	We got a rude phone call that ruined our day.
1264480	1266480	And it was Duchenne saying that he had just gotten
1266480	1268480	a phone call that ruined his day.
1268480	1271640	And it was that Arvin had called and said, you're next.
1271640	1273280	So we sped over there.
1273280	1274640	How did he say that, Luke?
1275520	1276720	Oh, I'm gonna kill you.
1276720	1277560	Yeah.
1280560	1282160	Oh, I'm gonna kill you.
1283760	1285120	Slicing up eyeballs.
1286880	1289440	It sounded like you said slicing up bibles.
1289440	1290840	Slicing up bibles.
1290840	1292520	New Testament, gone.
1293640	1294840	Mickey says eyeballs.
1296440	1297800	Slicing up eyeballs.
1299720	1303760	And then we found out that he was in Ocean City.
1305480	1306320	No, we did not.
1306320	1308760	What we found out is that the phone call
1308760	1312320	came from Arvin Chilton's phone, which is in Ocean City.
1312320	1316120	And specifically, we found out after we went to go
1316120	1317920	keep watch over Duchenne that night.
1317920	1319160	We've got uniform PD.
1319160	1321400	We also had, yeah.
1321400	1324200	And we arrived ourselves at Duchenne's house.
1324200	1325760	When we called Chilton's phone,
1325760	1327840	we heard it vibrating upstairs.
1327840	1330200	And that's where we ended off.
1330200	1333440	Someone made an intelligence check about As You Like It.
1333440	1335480	I believe it was Agent Sparrow.
1335480	1337320	Which you passed and therefore you were allowed
1337320	1339680	to watch As You Like It today before we came in.
1339680	1341160	Right.
1341160	1342720	Otherwise you wouldn't have let me out of the cage.
1342720	1346080	I would have said, you cannot get out of this cage, Thomas.
1346080	1347760	Does it smell like David still?
1347760	1349200	I got some free time though.
1350200	1351800	And I watched As You Like It.
1351800	1353240	Why did we let him go?
1353240	1354080	I don't know.
1354080	1356000	It was such a rookie move.
1356000	1358480	It was so much fun to be a player.
1360560	1361960	All right, let's dig in.
1361960	1365120	It's March 25th, 2016.
1365120	1366120	The three of you are standing
1366120	1368000	in Arvin Chilton's apartment.
1368000	1369700	Say your character's names real quick
1369700	1371680	and your character voices starting with Joe.
1371680	1372520	Ellen Walling.
1372520	1373340	Now Luke.
1373340	1374180	Kevin Gelato.
1374180	1375100	Now Thomas.
1375100	1376360	Agent Clarissa Sparrow.
1376360	1377960	Wow, I loved that.
1377960	1379120	We should do that more often.
1379120	1383040	Okay, it's March 25th, 2016.
1383040	1386680	You're all in Alexander Duchenne's apartment.
1387520	1390200	It is pouring down rain outside.
1390200	1392160	It is now dark.
1392160	1394800	There are four squad cars outside.
1394800	1398560	You know that there are some ocean city.
1398560	1399400	Some ocean.
1399400	1400220	Sorry, I've got to snap.
1400220	1401060	I've got to take this.
1401060	1401900	Yeah, of course.
1401900	1405440	There's some ocean shitty police officers outside
1407120	1409240	who had their kick the dog moment
1409240	1411000	when they made fun of Kevin Gelato.
1412300	1415760	Yeah, he hasn't forgotten that.
1415760	1417040	He doesn't forget much.
1417040	1418800	And as the three of you are standing
1418800	1420640	inside Alexander Duchenne's apartment,
1420640	1424560	you've asked him to call back Arvin Chilton.
1426600	1427440	Brring, brring.
1427440	1428260	Brring, brring.
1428260	1429100	Brring, brring.
1429100	1429940	Brring, brring.
1429940	1430760	Brring, brring.
1430760	1431600	Brring, brring.
1431600	1432440	Brring, brring.
1432440	1433260	Brring, brring.
1433260	1435520	And you hear from upstairs,
1435520	1437520	look at this photograph.
1437520	1438520	Look at this photograph.
1438520	1440280	Look at this photograph.
1440280	1444920	Chad Krager classic photograph by Nickelback,
1444920	1448340	which is the vibrate thin ring, ring tone.
1449800	1452300	On Arvin Chilton's phone.
1452300	1455340	Let's go ahead and move in dexterity order.
1455340	1457600	So who has the highest dexterity?
1457600	1458440	60.
1458440	1459760	I got a 70.
1459760	1460600	60.
1460600	1463880	Joe, you were going to kick off in this-
1463880	1465920	So the phone rings and we're in combat?
1465920	1470280	Yeah, Joe is looking at me with like, incredulity.
1470280	1472240	Is it like that we're racing upstairs?
1472240	1474400	Nope, you can do whatever you want.
1474400	1477920	Okay, Elwood would not be the first one out the door.
1478040	1479000	Sure, you don't have to be.
1479000	1480200	Just because you're acting first
1480200	1481940	doesn't mean that you need to, you know.
1481940	1482780	Gotcha.
1482780	1484660	I thought that's what you were having us talk about,
1484660	1485920	is marching order kind of thing.
1485920	1487480	Well, we are talking,
1487480	1489320	we're talking just about action order.
1489320	1491040	So not marching order necessarily,
1491040	1494180	but we're going to start with what do you do?
1494180	1495720	Make wide eyes at the guys
1495720	1499020	and do the silence over the mouth thing and point up.
1499020	1499860	Awesome.
1499860	1501920	I'm going to roll intelligence real quick.
1503360	1504200	Pass.
1504200	1505200	What are you looking for here?
1505200	1506880	The song is by Nickelback.
1506960	1508240	Thank you.
1508240	1510480	I was going to do something if I failed my intelligence roll
1510480	1511440	but I'm not going to do that.
1511440	1513800	Always fun when a role player in your group
1513800	1517240	decides to just voluntarily maybe fuck something up.
1519320	1520160	Hey man.
1521160	1522200	Zach's like, it's fun for me.
1522200	1525080	It's also what you've been a part of forever.
1526160	1527280	No, no, no, no, no.
1527280	1531820	We stumble into hilarious farce.
1533220	1536200	But if you're like, yeah, my guys yells.
1537440	1538280	He's too dumb.
1538280	1540080	It wasn't going to be that, but.
1541120	1541960	Hello?
1544400	1546400	Because Luke decided that he was thinking
1546400	1547280	about doing something,
1547280	1550000	let's just have agent Sparrow is going to go next.
1550000	1550840	Cool.
1550840	1551920	Agent Sparrow draws her gun
1551920	1553760	when she hears the vibrating phone.
1553760	1557080	And then she looks around to see how Duchenne is reacting.
1557080	1558360	He is immediately like,
1560240	1561320	and he's horrified.
1561320	1563720	And he is like looking for a place to hide.
1564680	1566160	Okay.
1567160	1570480	Can I do any kind of examination of him?
1570480	1573560	Like an ocular pat down and see if this is.
1574560	1576600	I want to see if he's wearing a human suit.
1578600	1581800	Okay, ocular pat down to see if he's wearing a human suit.
1581800	1583080	What do you want to roll for that?
1583080	1583920	What do you think?
1583920	1584760	Medicine or?
1584760	1589240	Search, medicine, intelligence, humans.
1589240	1591760	I think you would be able to determine.
1593320	1595520	My intelligence is telling me he's not human.
1596440	1597280	Three.
1597280	1600400	Oh, and three on the check.
1600400	1601760	That was supposed to happen.
1601760	1602600	It's on a timer.
1605480	1607240	A light just turned out in the room.
1608400	1610280	There's a grow light on the plants in the corner.
1610280	1611720	Cause I don't get enough sun.
1613760	1617160	He has the bearing of someone who is in public service
1617160	1618560	who worked for the feds.
1618560	1620920	Like the way that he reacted was something
1620920	1623040	that someone with military experience.
1623040	1626440	Like he's got big claws and fur all over him.
1626440	1627960	What did I say?
1627960	1628800	He said.
1628800	1629640	He has the bearing.
1629640	1631480	Oh my God.
1631480	1633760	I was like, I know it was.
1633760	1635600	I didn't think it was actually going to be relevant.
1635600	1640320	I thought it was a real big reach.
1640320	1641160	Like a bear might have.
1641160	1642000	Like a bear has.
1642000	1644600	Like a bear has.
1644600	1647040	Thomas is forgetting his background.
1647040	1649440	He was not in any kind of law enforcement or.
1649440	1651520	All that you know about Alexander Duchene
1651520	1655680	is that he supposedly played baseball when he was younger.
1655680	1658120	And you like don't know if that was.
1658120	1660400	I mean, he said he wasn't very good at it,
1660400	1662400	but that's all you really got about him.
1662400	1663920	You don't know a lot about him.
1663920	1666320	He's old enough to have been retired though.
1666320	1668480	And landlord is the retirement thing.
1668480	1669800	Oh, a hundred percent.
1669800	1671360	He's 79 years old.
1671360	1672480	Yeah.
1672480	1676360	Which like, you know, for me, I'll still be working.
1676360	1677200	That's right.
1677200	1678040	That's because.
1678040	1681280	Yeah, everyone listening here will be working
1681280	1684920	in the water mines until.
1684920	1687560	But here in 2016, a 79 year old is still
1687560	1688840	pulling social security.
1688840	1689760	Right.
1689760	1692080	Not working for Bezos H2O.
1692080	1694680	When you say that, does he look like a 79 year old man
1694680	1695760	who has that background?
1695760	1699560	Or does this look like Arvin Chilton in the body
1699560	1702880	or like something controlling his body in an unnatural way?
1702880	1707080	Go ahead and roll sanity agent Sparrow.
1707080	1709560	Pass 58 on a current 80.
1709560	1712080	Yeah, this is just learning something new
1712080	1712920	about Alexander D. Shane.
1712920	1716160	Damn it, this is when I should have failed sanity, right?
1716160	1717920	This is just learning something new
1717920	1719600	about Alexander D. Shane.
1719600	1722840	This is an interesting moment of conflict for Thomas.
1722840	1723680	Yeah, of course.
1723680	1724720	Because I have a lot of suspicions
1724720	1725540	about what's going on here.
1725540	1726380	Why wouldn't you?
1726380	1728840	However, the main thing is that agent Sparrow
1728840	1731640	doesn't know she's in a scenario called control copy.
1731640	1732480	Sure.
1732480	1733400	I don't know why you keep saying that
1733400	1734960	because I don't know what that means.
1734960	1738360	Shut the fuck up.
1740360	1741360	Don't gaslight me.
1741360	1745100	I don't know anything about computers.
1745100	1746920	No, it's your job, but.
1746920	1749040	It's my job to gaslight you.
1749040	1750620	That's what a DM does.
1752560	1755880	In Delta Green, yeah, like half the time for sure.
1755880	1756720	Yeah.
1756720	1759480	So without metagaming, what do you do next?
1760840	1762680	Like my only possible actions
1762680	1764300	lead me towards a terrible fate.
1764500	1765580	Right, yeah.
1765580	1767500	But I guess that's the game we play, so.
1767500	1768340	It is.
1768340	1770940	She, passing that sanity test,
1770940	1773420	she all of a sudden thinks he might be
1773420	1775980	a little more capable than she estimated.
1775980	1776820	Sure.
1776820	1780420	So she says to the uniformed PD,
1780420	1782860	you stay on him, you protect him.
1782860	1784420	I'm going upstairs.
1784420	1786340	Luke, what is Kevin Gelato doing?
1786340	1789800	He looks up at where the vibration is coming from
1789800	1791740	and looks down at his hand.
1791740	1793140	Which is balled up into a fist.
1793140	1793980	Right.
1794500	1797060	Sorry, let me say that again without vaping my mouth.
1797060	1799440	He looks down at his hand, which is balled up into a fist,
1799440	1803460	but then he sees Sparrow start heading towards the door
1803460	1805580	and decides to follow her.
1805580	1806580	I'll go first.
1806580	1808260	And he heads up the stairs.
1808260	1809260	No, no, wait.
1809260	1810500	He waits.
1810500	1811860	Let me in first.
1811860	1813980	He lets her in front of him.
1813980	1816900	Okay, are you approaching the stairs stealthily
1816900	1818700	or are you gonna run up them?
1818700	1820900	Stealthily, but quickly.
1820900	1822060	Which one of the two of you
1822060	1824480	has the worst stealth of the two?
1825700	1826540	I don't have any.
1826540	1827360	I have 10%.
1827360	1828200	Yeah, same.
1828200	1829540	Okay, so either one of you can roll.
1831840	1832680	You should roll.
1834680	1835780	I got a 91.
1836740	1838820	She's like running up like FBI.
1838820	1841100	She's not saying it, but she runs up the stairs,
1841100	1841940	drawn gone.
1841940	1845220	And behind her, I mean, behind her, you hear.
1845220	1847820	Dump, dump, dump.
1847820	1848640	Wha-choo!
1848640	1852800	Bless you, but be quiet.
1852800	1854340	And the door is closed.
1854340	1855580	Locked?
1855580	1857120	No, she opens it.
1857120	1859680	So just like in Silence of the Lambs,
1859680	1860980	which we watched yesterday,
1860980	1863240	remember at her Quantico training,
1863240	1864560	where she gets capped.
1864560	1865960	Oh, yeah.
1865960	1867120	From behind the door, she missed the corner.
1867120	1868440	She didn't check her corners.
1868440	1870960	She carefully opens the doors, checking her corners.
1870960	1873160	I love trade craft.
1873160	1875800	Feels so good when it's well used in a game.
1875800	1877180	Man, that's excellent.
1877180	1879780	Okay, so because you checked the corners,
1879780	1882200	you get to see the same thing you would have seen
1882200	1886620	if you hadn't, which is absolutely nothing different
1886620	1889940	in this room except for there is a phone
1889940	1892940	sitting on the kitchen countertop.
1892940	1894720	Can we clock that it definitely wasn't there
1894720	1896260	the last time we were in the apartment?
1896260	1899780	100% it wasn't, but question for Elwood Boyd.
1899780	1902180	Are you now upstairs or are you hanging out downstairs?
1902180	1905180	I am standing behind Kevin like he's a human shield.
1905180	1906020	Okay, perfect.
1906060	1908260	Literally peeking out from behind it from time to time.
1908260	1910260	Yes, and your hands went up to prove it.
1911900	1915380	Are there any security cameras on the property?
1915380	1917140	No, none that you're aware of.
1917140	1921320	What if I rolled electrician to see if there is one?
1921320	1922920	Yeah, okay, go ahead and roll.
1922920	1923780	It's my craft.
1923780	1924900	Okay, fantastic.
1924900	1926280	I love a craft.
1926280	1929220	Just four young witches learning how to.
1929220	1931300	There's not any security cameras.
1931300	1932140	Thomas showed me the craft.
1932140	1934020	I'd never seen it until Thomas showed me that movie.
1934020	1934980	A couple of Halloween's ago.
1935020	1935860	No, yeah, I remember it,
1935860	1937300	but I think that was the first time I watched it too.
1937300	1938740	Oh, nice, it was rad.
1938740	1939580	What's up?
1939580	1944580	What about a dating show with witches
1944760	1947200	called Craft American Singles?
1949020	1949860	Yeah.
1953060	1954820	The Craft American Singles, but yeah.
1954820	1958780	It's always good when a show has sponsorship built into it.
1958780	1960460	Oh yeah, it's paid for already.
1960460	1962100	Yeah, wait, forget the witches.
1962100	1963900	Can this just be a cheese dater show?
1965100	1966660	What kind of cheese do you like?
1966660	1968040	I only eat craft.
1970260	1971900	I failed, so there's not any security cameras.
1971900	1973740	Oh, you failed, okay, sounds good.
1973740	1977460	No security cameras around to speak of that you know of.
1977460	1979560	Everything seems to be in the exact same place
1979560	1980400	where it was left.
1980400	1981220	No footprints or anything.
1981220	1983060	Like bloody footprints obviously right there.
1983060	1985540	No obvious bloody footprints, no.
1985540	1987300	Can I get this room and ocular pad down?
1987300	1989780	Absolutely, roll forensics for me.
1989780	1990620	Eight.
1990620	1993740	An eight on a forensics check shows that yes,
1993740	1996380	someone has absolutely been in this apartment.
1996380	1998060	You can tell because there's now a phone
1998060	2000100	in the middle of the table.
2000100	2005100	There's a path of dirt in between the front door
2007060	2009100	and the kitchen where the phone is.
2009100	2011380	If I forensic that and get a critical success,
2011380	2012380	can I Sherlock it?
2012380	2015460	You would absolutely Sherlock the entire fucking thing.
2015460	2016300	This is from.
2021100	2022300	So yeah, I failed.
2022300	2024820	She leans down and like picks up some of the dirt
2024820	2027040	and rubs it between her fingers and smells it.
2027040	2028980	And this person had stepped in dog shit
2028980	2030180	and she got some dog shit.
2030180	2031340	Yeah, a hundred percent.
2031340	2033500	But you know that that dog shit was fresh.
2033500	2036660	So like this clearly happened in between the time
2036660	2039740	where you were here earlier and now.
2039740	2042260	Kevin sees her doing that and is like,
2042260	2043900	oh, that's maybe I should do that too.
2043900	2045300	Maybe I should smell the dog shit.
2045300	2048420	And he like eats a little bit of it.
2048420	2049260	Yeah.
2049260	2050080	He's like.
2050080	2050920	No, no, yeah.
2050920	2051760	He just nods his head.
2052160	2053000	No, I hate this.
2053000	2053840	Yes, keep doing it.
2053840	2057400	He nods his head in his mind.
2057400	2059360	He's like, that's definitely dog shit.
2059360	2060520	I've had that before.
2060520	2061360	Sure.
2062520	2065040	But he just nods his head having no idea
2065040	2065960	what she's thinking.
2065960	2068440	She gives him the saddest look.
2069680	2071900	He thinks she's sad because she can't figure out
2071900	2073400	where the dog shit came from.
2073400	2074240	Oh.
2080720	2082200	Four rolls.
2082200	2083040	What's up guys?
2083040	2086300	Zach rolled the dice four times and then didn't say anything.
2086300	2090200	If Elwood feels like the room is empty, do I?
2090200	2091040	Yep.
2091040	2092160	I want to go in and go to the phone.
2092160	2094260	I want to grab the phone and I want to look through it.
2094260	2095440	Is this a studio?
2095440	2096280	Yeah.
2096280	2097120	Okay.
2097120	2097940	We're in the only room.
2097940	2098780	You are in the only room.
2098780	2100960	The only other thing is the bathroom.
2100960	2102760	There's two doors, closet and bathroom.
2102960	2104120	Does that dirt trail lead to the bathroom?
2104120	2104960	Nope.
2104960	2106080	Does that dirt trail lead to the closet?
2106080	2107240	Nope.
2107240	2108540	Does that dirt trail lead to the phone
2108540	2109380	and then back out the door?
2109380	2110220	Yep.
2110220	2111040	Okay.
2111040	2113100	This dirt trail leads out the floor.
2115880	2118280	This dirt trail leads to the door and out and...
2120520	2122360	This dirt trail leads to the door after it leads
2122360	2126320	to the phone, which it led to from the door.
2126320	2128880	It's actually dog shit, not dirt.
2130320	2131160	I know.
2132160	2133000	Me too.
2133880	2134720	Yeah, I know too.
2134720	2135880	I saw, yeah.
2135880	2137200	Maybe he has a...
2137200	2138040	Does that...
2138040	2138880	Alvin?
2138880	2140480	What's his fucking name?
2140480	2141320	Arvin.
2141320	2142140	Arvin.
2142140	2142980	Arvin.
2142980	2144800	But I thought his name was Alvin last episode too.
2144800	2145640	Arvin!
2148480	2150200	Does Arvin have a dog?
2150200	2153240	I have a feeling it's probably just an environmental hazard.
2153240	2154080	Okay.
2154080	2155680	Have you ever stepped in dog shit?
2155680	2157320	No.
2157320	2158160	Well, I have.
2158160	2159240	I was never trying to.
2159240	2163440	Whoa, what a weird way to answer that question.
2163440	2164280	I just assumed.
2164280	2165200	He didn't want to be embarrassed.
2165200	2168000	Yeah, she's like, who steps in dog shit?
2168000	2170360	I don't step in dog shit.
2170360	2172240	It's okay, everybody steps in it sometimes.
2172240	2173080	You don't know.
2173080	2173900	A lot.
2173900	2174740	Some people even say it's good luck.
2174740	2175760	A lot, I'm lucky.
2175760	2177640	Yeah, because after you stepped in dog shit,
2177640	2179520	what's the worst thing that could happen to you that day?
2179520	2181000	You get it in your mouth.
2181000	2182700	Yeah, you did that.
2182700	2184120	You did that.
2184120	2185140	But that happened before.
2185140	2186720	You haven't stepped in any of it yet.
2186720	2187560	No.
2187560	2188480	So there you go.
2188560	2189960	Once you've stepped in it,
2189960	2191680	probably nothing worse will happen
2191680	2194000	than putting that shit in your mouth.
2194000	2195300	What kind of phone is it?
2195300	2196140	Good talk.
2196140	2197560	I watched a trailer today.
2197560	2198960	Quick trailer alert.
2198960	2200280	Trailer alert!
2200280	2202000	You guys know how we do trailer alerts?
2202000	2204080	Yeah, classic trailer alert.
2204080	2205360	Stop trying to make trailer alerts a thing.
2205360	2206520	Trailer alert!
2207800	2211320	We watched a trailer for a Netflix Christmas movie today
2211320	2213620	with the guy from Crazy Rich Asians
2213620	2216840	and the blonde girl from Game of Thrones.
2216840	2217680	And-
2218080	2222200	They, she, a bird shits in her eye.
2222200	2223040	Nice.
2223040	2223880	And she fucking dies.
2223880	2226220	And he tells her it's good luck.
2226220	2228680	And she's like, what?
2228680	2229520	That's-
2229520	2230740	And he's like, do you want to go out with me?
2230740	2231740	And she's like, no.
2233440	2234280	Yeah.
2235200	2236240	Dog shit I get.
2236240	2237080	If a bird shits in your eye-
2237080	2240040	A bird shit in her eye and they show it in the trailer
2240040	2244240	of like the goop hitting, which now, uh oh, side story.
2244240	2247200	I saw Kings of Leon perform after the-
2248200	2249040	In a bird shit in your eye?
2249040	2250480	I think you told this on the pod already.
2250480	2251320	Have I?
2251320	2252640	Oh, okay, then I won't tell it again.
2252640	2253960	But when I saw Kings of Leon,
2253960	2258440	they played outside in a bird shit in the bassist's mouth.
2258440	2262580	And they shut down the show after three songs.
2262580	2263640	I remember that was in the news
2263640	2264860	when it happened because of that.
2264860	2266880	Okay, they opened with Closer,
2266880	2269200	which is the first song off Only By The Night.
2269200	2272520	And then they played the next song off Only By The Night,
2272520	2275360	which is Crawl, which is a fucking jam.
2275360	2277620	And then they played Taper Jean Girl,
2277620	2280200	which was fucking rad.
2280200	2283560	And so I heard the only three songs I like
2283560	2288200	by Kings of Leon and during the third one, a bird strip.
2288200	2291960	I watched the shit fall down from the rafters
2291960	2294840	and the bassist looked up at just the wrong time
2294840	2297240	and it landed directly in his mouth.
2297240	2301920	He ripped his bass off of himself and walked off stage.
2302160	2304600	And then they finished the song and left.
2304600	2306020	That's so lame.
2306020	2307880	Listen, I don't know how much shit
2307880	2309400	went how far down his throat.
2309400	2313800	I can imagine a scenario in which I need to stop the show.
2313800	2315360	But I think in most scenarios,
2315360	2317040	if a bird shit in your mouth,
2317040	2318920	you fucking wash that shit out.
2318920	2319760	You take a minute.
2319760	2320600	You take a minute and you go to bed.
2320600	2322880	You take a minute and then you go play a kick ass rock show.
2322880	2325280	It was made exponentially better
2325280	2329760	because Justin Bieber broke his leg on stage
2329760	2331120	and finished the show.
2331160	2333840	Justin Bieber just out rockstar'd you.
2333840	2335920	Yeah, and they're like.
2335920	2336760	He's a pop star.
2336760	2339880	They're like, we're southern whiskey drinking boys.
2339880	2340840	Is that their deal?
2340840	2341660	Yeah.
2341660	2342500	I thought that the deal was
2342500	2343340	that they were vaguely Christian.
2343340	2346000	Their dad was like a tent preacher or something.
2346000	2347240	We should get back to the episode.
2347240	2352240	So there is a phone sitting on the kitchen countertop.
2352840	2354040	I wanna pick it up and look through it.
2354040	2354860	Yeah, of course.
2354860	2358280	It matches all the incoming and outgoing phone calls
2358320	2360200	that you would recognize from the log
2360200	2363000	that you got from the FBI.
2363000	2364720	I wanna check text messages.
2364720	2366420	Yeah, when you go into text messages,
2366420	2369240	there are very few and far between.
2369240	2372460	It seems that Chilton was not much of a texter.
2372460	2374840	Can I look for correspondence with his ex-wife
2374840	2376720	before that phone call that she received
2376720	2377960	a few days before she died?
2377960	2381960	It had been a long time since he had called her, yeah.
2381960	2382920	Is there a role I can do
2382920	2384880	to make sure I'm not missing anything in this phone?
2384880	2386020	What do you wanna roll for that?
2386020	2387120	I'll do it too.
2387120	2388480	That's an eight on SIGINT.
2388480	2390100	Oh dude, hell yeah.
2390100	2393560	So, cause you rolled SIGINT and I love that skill
2393560	2395720	and we never use it,
2395720	2397920	if you go through the photos
2397920	2400840	and you start scrolling through,
2400840	2405840	you're gonna realize that each panel of like nine photos,
2407080	2412080	the top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right,
2412160	2416720	remind you strangely of like the points
2416720	2418680	of that weird pentagram thing.
2418680	2419520	The flesh pentagram.
2419520	2420360	The Vitruvian man pentagram.
2420360	2422480	Yeah, that you saw earlier.
2422480	2423600	And all the nudes remind us
2423600	2426120	of the testament of the nude flesh.
2426120	2426960	Pfft.
2426960	2427800	Mm-hmm.
2427800	2428840	Mm-hmm.
2428840	2430000	That really got me.
2430000	2430840	It did.
2430840	2433080	I felt like I stole something.
2433080	2434680	Like that wasn't that good.
2434680	2435520	Mm-hmm.
2437200	2440400	Arvin Chilton, or whoever was using this phone,
2440400	2444280	is clearly involved with
2444280	2445960	the testament of the nude flesh.
2445960	2446800	Thank you.
2446800	2451400	Maybe we, you should Google the new flesh
2451400	2455560	and see if we can join in quotation words.
2455560	2456480	While I'm holding this phone,
2456480	2458920	can I just Google that, the testament of the new flesh?
2458920	2461960	When you go to Google the testament of the new flesh
2461960	2463800	and it autofills.
2463800	2464640	Autofills, sure.
2466520	2469080	Autofilled, he's been looking it up himself.
2469080	2470400	Have you seen these pictures here?
2470400	2473320	He's even like doing the diagram in his photos.
2473320	2474560	He knows something.
2474560	2477040	He's part of this group, I think.
2477040	2479880	Seeing that pattern that they've seen in the photos,
2479880	2482960	she asks Elwood, if you go to the call logs,
2482960	2486480	are there any numbers, new numbers that start appearing
2486480	2489640	around the same time as that photo pattern?
2489640	2491040	Let me see here.
2491040	2494040	It looks like there's, yeah, there's one here
2494040	2497560	that he hadn't called before, the 20th.
2497560	2499440	Yeah, it's a new one to him.
2499440	2500920	When did he last call it?
2500920	2501960	I wonder when he last called it.
2501960	2502800	23rd.
2502800	2504880	Click on the info and it says the 23rd.
2504880	2508240	That was the day, three days after the deaths?
2508240	2509080	Two days after the deaths.
2509080	2510400	Two days after the initial deaths,
2510400	2512720	but the same day as the gas station death.
2512720	2514440	Yeah, what time is the call
2514440	2515840	in relation to the gas station death?
2515840	2516840	Earlier.
2516840	2518020	Okay.
2518020	2521240	And the date of the first phone call?
2521240	2522320	The day before.
2522320	2524960	So the day after the McCarty's were murdered
2525000	2528520	and then the day that the gas station attendant,
2528520	2530240	Quentin Harris was murdered.
2530240	2532240	But before the murder occurred.
2532240	2534120	But before that Quentin Harris murder.
2534120	2537480	And this is just like a phone number, not a saved contact.
2537480	2538320	It doesn't say like.
2538320	2539160	Not a saved contact.
2539160	2540160	Cool cult number.
2540160	2542080	It does not say cool cult number.
2542080	2544640	Is the area code the same like Ocean City?
2544640	2545480	Great question.
2545480	2549800	It is, it is not an Ocean City number.
2549800	2551600	Is it like a New York City number?
2551600	2553360	It's Newark, baby.
2553360	2554200	Newark.
2554280	2555480	No, sorry, shit.
2556480	2557400	Am I dumb?
2557400	2559540	Do you not know your nation's area codes?
2561280	2563280	It's 417 and Zach made the call.
2563280	2565080	No, I'm sorry, it's Newark.
2565080	2566920	And is there a duration listed
2566920	2568440	for how long these calls lasted?
2568440	2572560	The first one is two and a half minutes
2572560	2574740	and the second one is 30 seconds.
2578080	2579480	Oh, okay.
2579720	2580560	Oh.
2583480	2584800	Zach's rolling and laughing.
2584800	2585640	Four times.
2586520	2587360	Oh my God.
2587360	2589320	Again for the second time.
2589320	2590700	Everybody roll alertness.
2592760	2593600	94.
2595360	2596200	Four.
2596200	2597480	I pass with a 14.
2597480	2601740	It is raining outside.
2601740	2603480	The highest success was a 14?
2603480	2604880	Yeah, it's raining outside.
2609480	2614160	It's like I'm on the last bend of the deep end
2614160	2618000	but the drowning's been just fine.
2618000	2622320	And when my ears pop and the shell shock
2622320	2626280	of this pit stop frees my mind.
2626280	2628360	I'll be all right.
2628360	2633360	I can go there now that I stare death in the face.
2634440	2636520	I'll be all right.
2636520	2641520	I can go there now that I stare death in the face.
2658840	2663840	Doesn't it always seem like the parts that made us laugh
2664480	2665800	now make us cry?
2667040	2670840	Doesn't it always seem like the villain
2670840	2674240	pulling the strings is a regular guy?
2675440	2680440	You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.
2683480	2688480	Kerosene wipes clean what we couldn't bear to tarnish.
2688480	2689480	I'll be all right.
2689480	2694480	I can go there now that I stare death in the face.
2695480	2697480	I'll be all right.
2697480	2702480	I can go there now that I stare death in the face.
2718480	2723480	I can go there now that I stare death in the face.
2740480	2745480	There's a conundrum in the wisdom of my spirit.
2746480	2750480	White washed hymns and the deadliest sins
2750480	2752480	push me to my limit.
2754480	2757480	But when you deconstruct
2757480	2761480	you're shit out of luck for a minute.
2762480	2769480	After the last bend you can break it all down to rebuild it.
2775480	2795480	You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.
2797480	2803480	You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.
2805480	2807480	I'll be all right.
2807480	2813480	I can go there now that I stare death in the face.
2813480	2815480	I'll be all right.
2815480	2821480	I can go there now that I stare death in the face.
