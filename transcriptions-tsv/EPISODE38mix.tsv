0	8600	Hello people in this airplane we call life, it's your captain speaking Wolf the dog, and
8600	13880	I'm here to airdrop some news on y'all while flying drunk.
13880	22880	We are taking over the skies here at 694.2 PTBP the sky kingdoms newest and best and
22880	26180	only radio show.
26180	33300	Look out skybound geese I'm hungry for bird bones and these propellers are awfully sharp.
33300	39180	I've got an announcement here from my producer it seems that a few days ago on the first
39180	46060	of the month the third patreon exclusive episode dropped for all of our honorary police officers.
46060	52900	Joe Luke Taylor Thomas and Zach got together and played a disgusting and delicious game
52900	55280	of the end of the world.
55280	60980	You can hear that as well as our first two bonus episodes, a Q&A session, and a game
60980	66460	of everyone is john by following the link to our patreon in the show notes or going
66460	73860	to patreon.com slash pretending pod and becoming an honorary police officer by pledging 5 bucks
73860	77100	a month to keep the show alive.
77100	82860	Honey might help wolf's bowels but honey right in to help wolf's howls it's howling
82860	84660	with wolf.
84660	91180	This week's howling with wolf comes from at the underdash millennial c who tagged at pretending
91180	97840	pod in an instagram story y'all know how tickled I get when you take time out of your day to
97840	100060	share the show with your friends.
100060	101940	At the millennial c he writes
130060	136500	It dumb, so much to do, so much to see, so what's wrong with taking the back streets,
136500	146220	you never know if you don't go, you never shine if you don't glow, y'all wolf rarely
146220	151820	lets his emotions get the best of him but when someone takes the time to write up something
151820	159340	so personal and meaningful it just... stop it wolf, stop licking up my tears, remember
159340	164580	if you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl tag at pretending pod on instagram
164580	170260	or twitter tag pretending to be people on facebook or write a 5 star review and email
170260	177220	us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com fuck all that dumb social media bullshit after
177220	184180	all it only dictates whether wolf gets to eat trash or has to eat trash and wolf has
184180	189060	a distaste for mistakes that dicks fake to get milkshakes.
189060	190900	It's time for the news
190900	197200	Last time, Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore, and Keith Vigna came to the dark mausoleum
197200	201220	of their former co-worker Ari Manstein.
201220	206500	They all had four names burned into their skin, Marvin on their chests, Maggie on the
206500	212580	bottom of their left foot, Drew on the backs, and Tilly on their dominant palms.
212580	217460	Keith Vigna called the number left by Agent Kennedy and he answered a few questions from
217460	219660	an automated voice.
219660	223660	John drove the three of them in Keith's cruiser to Jim Cook's house.
223660	228260	In the neighborhood, every light pole was fitted with a sign warning residents about
228260	230060	Clark Bishop.
230060	235700	In Jim Cook's house, Clark showed his partners the book he found and slowly realized he might
235700	241060	be the overseer that Maggie Cook and the Circle of Knowledge is intent on bringing back.
241060	247340	A slow drip of vodka from the ceiling led the three sort of officers upstairs to search
247380	249300	for a room without a door.
249300	254420	Keith knocked on the wall to avoid kicking a stud and then put his foot right through
254420	256700	the wall in the hallway.
256700	261620	It is December 6th, 3pm, and Keith Vigna has one foot in.
261620	263660	I've got one foot out.
263660	273420	And shaking it all about is kudzu with no backbone.
277340	305500	It's all really funny to me.
305500	307740	There's some really good ones, yeah.
307740	311620	I saw there's like a Zuckerberg one that was like, not verbatim, but basically it's like
311620	316780	he was, he's the one like pushing a bunch of money so that people will go storm area
316780	320700	51 so they can go find his dad.
320700	328660	Oh my god.
328660	329660	Fuck Mark Zuckerberg.
329660	336900	Alright, so Keith gets pushed through this wall by John Lee Pettymore and Clark Bishop.
336900	338780	The drywall folds.
338780	340300	Also Midsummer Spoilers.
340300	347260	And Keith Vigna lands on the other side covered in debris and the hole opens up wide enough
347260	352580	for you guys to look in and in this secret room is a small living room set up.
352580	359220	There is a chair with an end table facing a small TV VCR that is sitting on top of a
359220	361660	pile of thick books.
361660	367740	There's a desk with a chair and there is a handle of vodka sideways on the floor next
367740	373420	to the end table poured out onto the rug that barely covers the makeshift floor beneath.
373420	378260	When you say makeshift floor, yeah, I'm picturing that this room is kind of like haphazardly
378260	383060	constructed and therefore the floor is this like plywood.
383060	384060	Like walking.
384060	385060	Just like sitting on the joists.
385060	386060	Yeah.
386060	388700	Like walking through an attic where you only want to walk on the planks.
388700	392780	Yeah, but they've made it so that they can at least like walk around.
392780	397060	Like he's made the, all of the floor load bearing for the most part.
397060	399580	And you said on the TV it's static or?
399580	401900	Yeah, there's static on the TV.
401900	404900	Are there any VCR tapes lying around?
404900	407980	There are no VHS tapes lying around.
408180	410180	What are the books the TV is sitting on?
410180	419740	The books that the TV is sitting on are thick textbooks on radiation and physics and quantum
419740	420980	mechanics.
420980	422260	Just a lot of lofty shit.
422260	423980	A lot of light reading.
423980	430620	The end table or any of the tables, do they have drawers in them?
430620	437900	No, but as you walk in and look further into this room, you see that on the end table there
437900	443900	is a small vial of clear liquid, a scalpel, and a box of tissues.
443900	445060	The vial.
445060	447140	When I pick it up, how heavy is it?
447140	449340	About as heavy as a glass vial should be.
449340	452780	Real fast, now that we're kind of standing in the room, taking a look around, could I
452780	456580	see another way into this room that wouldn't have needed to be knocked through a wall?
456580	457580	Yes.
457580	458580	What do I see?
458580	460500	There's just a small door in the corner of the room.
460500	464060	When you open it up, you kind of see on the other side that it was just a false wall.
464060	466500	So this was a secret room.
466500	467500	This is a hidden room.
467500	471620	So I open that door and I see a wall in front of me and I can push on it to open it?
471620	472620	Yeah.
472620	473620	Got it.
473620	474620	Where do I pop out?
474620	475620	Just in the hallway.
475620	476620	Upstairs.
476620	477620	Okay.
477620	478620	I have this vial in my hand.
478620	480700	I'm like, what do you guys think this is?
480700	484060	I'm not going to taste it, but I haven't opened it up yet.
484060	487900	With all the weird shit we've been dealing with, I feel like if I open this up, two things
487900	488900	could happen.
488900	494600	One, absolutely nothing, and then we wonder what happens, or two, some fucking something
494600	495600	crazy is going to happen.
495600	497800	What if you become like a Batman?
497800	499400	I don't want to be like Batman.
499400	502720	I want to, I don't know.
502720	503720	And I opened it up.
503720	504720	Sorry, I mean a man bat.
504720	511200	As you hold on to the bottom of the vial with one hand, your other hand kind of slowly goes
511200	518240	to grasp around the top of the vial and it's shaking a little bit and slowly twist off
518240	522720	the top with the rubber dropper on top.
523000	528280	As you lift it off, absolutely nothing happens.
528280	535160	As I learned in science class, as Keith Fignan learned in science class, I waft it into my
535160	537160	nose to see if I smell anything.
537160	538160	I love the wafting.
538160	540600	It's important for science.
540600	545480	That way you don't fall over and die in eighth grade science class.
545480	549280	This liquid seems to be not noxious in any way.
549280	554880	Well, I'm going to screw the lid back on and put that in one of my big old pockets
554880	555880	for now.
555880	556880	Okay.
556880	557880	There was a label on it, was there?
557880	558920	There was no label on it.
558920	560880	Is there anybody else in this room?
560880	562880	Yes, there are.
562880	563880	There's a man standing there.
563880	564880	There's a hundred people wanting to fight you.
564880	568200	Asking you to stop touching his things.
568200	569200	Please sir.
569200	574400	Can I do a search to see if I see anything else that I didn't just immediately see?
574400	580280	Well, as you guys continue to look around this room, you would notice that on the desk
580280	588060	are three folders and an envelope and the TV VCR itself, there is no antenna on it and
588060	589620	there's no coaxial plugged in.
589620	591720	It's just the power cable.
591720	597760	Hey John, you mentioned a TV in one of your visions.
597760	598760	Is this the TV?
598760	601500	It doesn't seem, no, it doesn't seem like it.
601500	602880	Can I unplug the TV?
602880	603880	Yeah.
604360	607160	When you unplug the TV, the static stops.
607160	609160	Like a TV.
609160	612200	I want to feel inside the VHS slot.
612200	615040	There is a VHS in the TV VCR.
615040	616040	Ooh, eject it please.
616040	617920	I plug the TV back in.
617920	625480	When you plug it in as John Lee Pettymore is clicking eject and a VHS pops out and it
625480	631080	is labeled Bishops WOF.
631080	632840	Stick it in there and see if we can not.
632840	637480	Wait, is the VCR plugged into the TV or is this a TV VCR combo?
637480	638480	It's a combo baby.
638480	639800	I go and look at that tape.
639800	643260	Is there anything in the WOF that, is it an acronym?
643260	645120	Is it periods between them or capitalized?
645120	646920	All capitalized periods in between.
646920	649120	You guys know what WOF could mean?
649120	650120	We're about to find out.
650120	653080	Put it back in there, see if it'll hit play.
653080	658760	An episode of Wheel of Fortune, of course.
658760	661760	Well hell man, this must have been where old you was hanging out.
661760	666920	And as the episode begins to play, you meet the contestants.
666920	673160	It's couples week on Wheel of Fortune and one of the set of contestants, Clark Bishop's
673160	674160	parents.
674160	678400	A very young Clark Bishop's parents.
678400	682480	They say that they had just gotten married and they are trying to win money for their
682480	683480	honeymoon.
683480	684960	Have I ever seen this before?
684960	685960	Nope.
685960	691560	Clark is maybe real sentimental about seeing this and sits in the chair opposite the TV
691560	693280	and watches intently.
693280	697120	John tries to see if there's any more vodka left.
697120	698120	There is some.
698120	704080	You know in the reservoir on a handle where I wouldn't have poured out the spout, there's
704080	705760	that much vodka left.
705760	709000	I take a swig and then pass it to, I offer it to Vigna.
709000	715560	I kind of put my hand up not wanting any of this spilled vodka, but I look at Clark sitting
715560	720720	down and watching this, I'm like, Clark, I know that you like Wheel of Fortune, but is
720720	723840	this really the time to sit down and start watching an episode?
723840	726840	Keith, those are my parents.
726840	728840	I've never seen this before.
728840	731360	Those are my parents on Wheel of Fortune.
731360	732560	That couple right there?
732560	738380	And I look at it and I look at both of them and I look at Clark and I'm like, my God,
738380	739540	those are your parents.
739540	740640	The resemblance is uncanny.
740640	745240	Yeah, I've never seen your parents before, but Jesus Christ, are those not your parents?
745240	747560	Is it canon that my parents look like me?
747560	748560	Oh shit.
748560	750680	You quoted earlier that that might not be the case.
750680	752240	I know I'm adopted.
752240	753240	Do you look like your parents?
753240	756280	I mean, I, yeah, I would say you've always seen it.
756280	759960	I've always seen it.
759960	761800	I want to keep watching the show.
761800	765840	I don't know how to, is there a role I can do to say, is there anything significant to
765840	773600	their play or maybe the puzzles they're doing or anything that would ping for Clark as a
773600	775800	thing that's interesting to note?
775800	778360	Do you want to watch the whole episode or are you just going to fast forward through
778360	783600	trying to catch like what each puzzle is and who solves it and how they do or honestly,
783600	788480	I'll probably watch as much as the boys will let me, what if you just try to fast forward
788480	789480	to your parents' parts?
789480	793640	I think pause and fast forwards have fast forward, but yeah, let's just, let's just
793640	794640	fast forward.
794640	798580	I'll just check out my parents' parts anytime they're on camera, push play, you keep going
798580	799580	through.
799580	803840	They seem to be doing quite well, so we'll fast forward until just your parents' parts
803840	804840	and watch that.
805040	809320	Fellas don't mind, I haven't seen this before and it's nice to see them moving around.
809320	813720	Yeah, and it's just weird as fuck that this is happening right now, that those are your
813720	814720	parents.
814720	819360	While he is watching it, I'm going to continue searching around this room.
819360	820360	Yeah, absolutely.
820360	826360	So you would notice that there are the three folders and an envelope that are on the desk
826360	827360	that you haven't touched.
827360	832080	Yeah, I would like to open up each of those starting with the first.
832080	833080	Okay.
833320	841240	Alright, so you open up one of the folders and on the inside you see a large stack of
841240	842240	papers.
842240	846200	It is labeled Operation Stapler.
846200	848060	How thick of a stack of papers?
848060	849060	Quite thick.
849060	853860	On the second page, there is a massive logo that you recognize.
853860	858280	It is an M that is made out of four double helices.
858280	860360	Is there an appendices?
860360	862000	What's the thing at the very beginning?
862000	863000	Index.
863000	864600	There is an index at the beginning as well.
864600	868680	So basically the front page says Operation Stapler.
868680	874360	On the second page, it's got the logo of the M with the double helices and under it, with
874360	877720	the same M spelled out, it says Myriad.
877720	878720	Myriad?
878720	879720	M-Y-R-I-A-D.
879720	886200	Can I go to the index and see what the highlights of the paper?
886200	887280	Yeah, absolutely.
887280	890680	So this is basically a program respec.
890680	900560	So this is someone who is going through and rewriting an existing program to create androids.
900560	907420	And the whole respec of this program is to cut down on cost and sell to private companies.
907420	914240	Is there anything in this about cutting costs, of where they cut costs on these androids?
914240	916760	Yeah, pretty much all across the board.
916760	918980	They cut it in staff.
918980	920700	They cut it in research.
920700	923700	They cut it in supplies.
923700	924700	Every aspect.
924700	929220	But not anything that indicates in the new androids, specifically like a certain thing
929220	932020	they really cut costs on?
932020	933020	Nope.
933020	934380	Mostly just an overall cut.
934380	938940	Is there any indication of what private companies they thought they might be able to sell them
938940	939940	to?
939940	941420	There are no indications.
941420	943020	I want to Google Myriad.
943020	944900	Not the word, but the...
944900	948060	When you Google Myriad, go ahead and roll.
948060	951140	Do you have a computers skill of some sort?
951140	952780	Yeah, I have 50 in computer science.
952780	953780	Oh, yeah.
953780	955780	Use that.
955780	957900	69, which is a success.
957900	958900	Oh, it's...
958900	959900	Fuck it, 66.
959900	960900	It's a fucking critical fail.
960900	961900	Critical fail.
961900	962900	Oh, no.
962900	966060	Myself, my smartphone explodes.
966060	972380	Actually looking at your phone, which is the phone that was just in Kevin's clothes.
972380	973380	It's not a smartphone.
973380	974380	All right.
974380	975380	Fuck.
975380	976380	You texted Google.
976380	977380	Cha-cha.
977380	978380	Cha-cha.
978380	979380	What is Myriad?
979380	982380	I'm just trying to remember what that was called.
982380	985380	It just gives the description of the actual word.
985380	988860	Cha-cha was awesome before you could just Google things on your phone.
988860	990420	Cha-cha was awesome.
990420	998340	The screen on your phone wobbles in a very strange way and covers your phone screen before
998340	1000300	it just goes back to normal.
1000300	1006340	Real fast, are androids something in this world that we know about?
1006340	1007340	Okay.
1007340	1012260	It's weird how often that you've interacted with them in the past six days for them to
1012260	1019300	have never been a thing in your life previous, aside from film and television, right?
1019300	1024140	Which I think maybe we might get copyright stung on this by George Lucas.
1024140	1025140	Yeah.
1025140	1027660	The inventor of androids.
1027660	1028660	He's a go-getter.
1028660	1030740	I think he's droid, not android.
1030740	1035020	Clark, as you keep fast forwarding through, your parents are killing it.
1035020	1038180	They took a commanding lead in the very first puzzle.
1038180	1039260	They were always good at it.
1039260	1044580	The second folder on this desk, it's the exact same setup with the papers, and on the front
1044580	1049220	page it says Operation Hole Puncher.
1049220	1053940	On the second page, there is the logo for the Circle of Knowledge, and then underneath
1053940	1057220	it it says Circle of Knowledge.
1057220	1063400	This one is a smaller paper, and the index is just a list of companies.
1063400	1065680	Myriad is not on that list?
1065680	1072680	As you go through them, Myriad is not on the list, and they are mostly non-profits, charities,
1072680	1075000	think tanks, and universities.
1075000	1079480	Is it small enough that I could maybe flip through to the first few, maybe like an introductory
1079480	1084200	page and learn what this is, what it pertains to?
1084200	1092920	It is a list of companies, and then each page of the company has a date, and an address,
1092920	1094100	and a phone number.
1094100	1095480	How many companies are there?
1095480	1096680	There are hundreds.
1096680	1097680	Okay.
1097680	1100560	On to the third folder.
1100560	1103280	Clark, your parents keep winning.
1103280	1104280	They just keep winning.
1104280	1105960	They're knocking it out of the park.
1105960	1113560	Both of them have now succeeded at calling out a puzzle, and they make it to the bonus
1113560	1115600	round, the final round.
1115600	1116600	Final Jeopardy, if you will.
1116600	1117640	I figured they would.
1117640	1127960	The third folder on the desk is called Operation Three Ring Binder, and it is empty, but inside
1127960	1135500	one of the pockets in this folder is this item, and you pull it out, and it is a dirty
1135500	1138440	dog grooming key fob.
1138440	1140800	Okay.
1140800	1142200	Keith has a crazy idea.
1142200	1145280	He opens up that first folder again.
1145280	1153600	I slip the ring on my finger, and I press it to the page with the M embossment or image.
1153600	1159760	As you move your hand closer to this page with the image of the M on it, your hands
1159760	1166200	start shaking, and you get close, and then you press the ring onto the paper, and nothing
1166200	1167200	happens.
1167200	1171480	I knew that's what was going to happen, but I wanted to try.
1171480	1174240	I'd like to open the envelope.
1174240	1175240	Okay.
1175240	1182600	Clark, the bonus round starts, and they put the clue up on, but they don't do the letters
1182600	1185760	yet, and then the bonus letters come on.
1185760	1187440	RST, that will mean.
1187440	1188440	Thank you.
1188440	1189440	Yeah.
1189440	1197480	And your mom turns to your dad and says, we're already given the best letters.
1197480	1203520	They solve the puzzle, and win the prize of the wheel of fortune, and the prize is
1203520	1204520	a honeymoon.
1204520	1205520	It may as well be.
1205520	1206520	They win a honeymoon.
1206520	1207520	Where do they go?
1207520	1208520	Branson.
1208520	1209520	Yep.
1209520	1216760	It's an all expense paid trip to Branson, Missouri.
1216760	1219360	Four nights, three days.
1219360	1223400	That's back in peak Branson, mind you, before Andy Williams die.
1223400	1224400	Yeah.
1224400	1225400	Anyway.
1225400	1235160	Thomas, John Lee Pettymore goes to the envelope, and I am now handing Thomas an envelope.
1235160	1244480	Keith looks at John, Kevin, and I'm just hoping that he just reads it out loud.
1244480	1247480	He doesn't.
1247480	1249480	What's it say, dude?
1249480	1250480	Hold on.
1250560	1254560	Oh, cool.
1254560	1256240	You know the wheel of fortune theme song?
1256240	1257680	That's Jeopardy, right?
1257680	1258680	That's Jeopardy.
1258680	1259680	Wheel of Fortune.
1259680	1260680	I don't know what there's.
1260680	1261680	That's it.
1261680	1271640	Wheel of Fortune is mostly like, it's a bunch of the stuff, and there's Wheel of Fortune,
1271640	1273720	and then it goes into Pat Sajak.
1273720	1274720	It's wheel.
1274720	1277360	It's motherfucking Pat Sajak up in this.
1277360	1282440	Can you just read it out loud though?
1282440	1286380	It starts with the symbol of the circle of knowledge, and it says faith through knowledge
1286380	1291720	is just called knowledge, which is the start of Jim Cook's letter disputing the revelations
1291720	1292720	of the overseer.
1292720	1293720	All right.
1293720	1296080	Faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.
1296080	1299920	Fellow keepers, it is with great sadness I write to you.
1299920	1301320	I fear a change is coming.
1301320	1305880	I cannot be certain, but I suspect there is one among us scheming with treacherous intent.
1305880	1308240	I have recently grown a tail.
1308240	1310560	He is not particularly skilled in going unnoticed.
1310560	1315240	He is an odd little man with round glasses on a fat face with no hair and no chin.
1315240	1320160	He is a journalist fired for trying to write an expose on Marvin Glass.
1320160	1321160	Stay alert.
1321160	1322160	Step carefully.
1322160	1325040	We are being watched, Jim Cook.
1325040	1331880	And a lot of the letters are either over or underlined.
1331880	1334400	So I'm just trying to write those out right now.
1334400	1335800	Round glasses, fat face.
1335800	1336800	Yeah.
1336800	1338880	Would that remind me of John Peters?
1338880	1340640	Didn't he have a round face?
1340640	1344160	A lot of people have round faces where I come from.
1344160	1346680	Who was the food guy?
1346680	1348300	What food guy?
1348300	1349680	Behind curtain number three.
1349680	1350680	Harold Dorsey.
1350680	1351680	Oh, yeah.
1351680	1353680	Behind curtain number three.
1353680	1354680	Behind Dorsey.
1354680	1356800	Yeah, he was a food critic.
1356800	1357800	I don't know.
1357800	1358800	I guess he could have been lying.
1358800	1361280	That was just the first thing that popped into my mind.
1361280	1362840	It probably isn't, but.
1362840	1363840	Yeah.
1364280	1366840	Because I looked up his website.
1366840	1368840	He was a food guy.
1368840	1373240	I guess he could have maybe stumbled on something and decided to run with it for a Marvin Glass
1373240	1374240	thing.
1374240	1375240	Yeah, probably not.
1375240	1376240	I don't know.
1376240	1377240	He was following around.
1377240	1378240	God damn it.
1378240	1379900	Who was he following around?
1379900	1381080	He was following.
1381080	1382320	He was trying to get.
1382320	1383320	Maggie Kirk.
1383320	1384320	But why?
1384320	1386120	Why was he following Maggie?
1386120	1387120	Why was he?
1387120	1389840	Maybe because she's Jim's son and he was following Jim.
1389840	1390840	But there was a reason.
1390840	1391840	Well, fuck.
1391840	1392840	I don't remember.
1392840	1393840	Probably my notes somewhere.
1393840	1394840	God damn it.
1394840	1395840	Okay.
1395840	1396840	I can't.
1396840	1397840	Here's this letter.
1397840	1402120	I can't make heads or tails of the underlying letters.
1402120	1404200	I got a Macau a GAC.
1404200	1407400	Is that anything close?
1407400	1408400	Macau a GAC.
1408400	1409400	Yeah.
1409400	1410400	You nailed it.
1410400	1411400	10 bonus points.
1411400	1412400	Some of them are overlined.
1412400	1413400	Some of them are underlined.
1413400	1420560	I will post a picture of this letter on our Instagram at pretending pod and on our Twitter
1420560	1421880	at pretending pod.
1421920	1422920	All right.
1422920	1425060	So I think I've got to figure it out.
1425060	1430040	Listening along at home and you want to try yourself, you might want to go to the pretending
1430040	1434520	to be people Instagram page now and take a look at that letter at pretending pod.
1434520	1435520	Hop on there.
1435520	1436520	Pause this.
1436520	1440240	See if you can solve it yourself because Thomas is about to break this motherfucker wide open.
1440240	1441240	All right.
1441240	1442240	So it's two sets of letters.
1442240	1444320	What was that about Instagram, John?
1444320	1445320	I don't know.
1445320	1450120	I was speaking in tongues.
1450160	1452320	There's two sets of letters here.
1452320	1455760	Half of them are overlined and half of them are underlined.
1455760	1458960	The overlined letters spell out Maggie.
1458960	1461320	The underlined letters spell out Cook.
1461320	1466720	I think old Jim was trying to tell us that his daughter Maggie is the, the trader he
1466720	1468400	suspects is among us.
1468400	1471600	Will you read, will you read that opening, that part where he, dear keepers, it is with
1471600	1472600	great sadness.
1472600	1474440	I write to you a fear of change coming.
1474440	1479160	I cannot be certain, but I suspect there is one among us scheming with treacherous intent.
1479200	1484120	And then he also, he mentioned his, uh, Oh hell, what did we decide his name was?
1484120	1486400	The reporter, Harold Dorsey, Harold Dorsey.
1486400	1488320	So I was, I was mulling that over.
1488320	1493640	I don't remember exactly why he was following Maggie, but he, he came in and told Drew that
1493640	1496880	he was going over to Maggie's and Drew said, I'd help you in.
1496880	1500280	Now that I think about it, Keith, Harold Dorsey just ran a blog.
1500280	1501280	I don't know.
1501280	1502280	He was old enough.
1502280	1503880	He could have had a life in journalism before that.
1503880	1507120	They said he got axed because he was touching a Marvin thing.
1507120	1510480	Well, let's look into some of the stuff he was writing about before he started talking
1510480	1511480	about Marvin.
1511480	1513700	Did he have an interest in the supernatural?
1513700	1520000	Talking about Harold, I stepped over Harold with Drew's body to pull him out of that exploding
1520000	1521000	building.
1521000	1522960	Harold was following Maggie.
1522960	1525600	Just Harold, H A R R E L L.
1525600	1526600	Harold?
1526600	1527600	Harold.
1527600	1529040	Okay, let me start that all over again.
1529040	1530040	Like a man, Carol?
1530040	1531880	I thought it was Harold Dorsey.
1531880	1535880	Yeah, I definitely did too because Harold's not a fucking name.
1535880	1538120	H A R R E L L.
1538120	1540120	I wrote down Harold.
1540120	1541120	Hey.
1541120	1542120	Okay.
1542120	1543120	Shit.
1543120	1546120	Kiss ass.
1546120	1547120	We're going to get you.
1547120	1548120	Luck, please.
1548120	1551440	We're going to get you after this podcast, Joe.
1551440	1555640	Joe gets five luck.
1555640	1556980	What's that put your luck at now, Joe?
1556980	1558880	If you're really giving it to me, it makes me 60.
1558880	1560840	Oh, I'm giving it to you.
1560840	1564160	I found out the Maggie Cook thing.
1564160	1565960	It just licked your tain a little bit.
1565960	1572760	Well, you're really taking a lot of the role play out of this for me.
1572760	1578500	This has all been an elaborate sexual fantasy for a sec.
1578500	1579500	Power fantasy, baby.
1579500	1581520	Anyway, Harold Dorsey, I stepped over him with Drew's body.
1581520	1586240	Everything is about sex, except for sex, which is about power.
1586240	1587600	Harold died in the explosion.
1587600	1590000	Or was he dead already when he walked in?
1590000	1591000	No.
1591000	1596480	When I walked in, it was Harold and Drew laying next to each other, puke all over the place,
1596480	1600680	Maggie's foot cut off, James, the mill worker's foot cut off.
1600680	1605160	I don't know if he's eating it or not, but a plate full of foot meat in front of him,
1605160	1611160	bullet in his head, tripped some sort of wire, and I had a split second decision to make.
1611160	1612600	I drug drew out of there.
1612600	1617260	I stepped over Harold Dorsey's body.
1617260	1622460	So our theory right now is that Harold Dorsey, turns out, was tailing Jim Cook, and Jim Cook
1622460	1627180	surmised that he was a disgraced journalist who had been searching for Marvin.
1627180	1629860	It's kind of two things that are kind of going against each other.
1629860	1632620	He was fired for writing about Marvin.
1632620	1635100	Now we know he had a blog, right?
1635100	1637780	Have we looked into that?
1637780	1643620	I thought for the most part it was a food blog, because I remember how we found out
1643620	1646940	about Harold was the Daily Fud.
1646940	1650460	Maybe he was obsessed with finding out what foot meat tasted like.
1650460	1654620	But also, I gotta admit, haven't you been wondering?
1654620	1656660	This just occurred to me.
1656660	1664700	He was a food writer, and Gary that runs the Daily Fud was following him around, but Gary
1664700	1671480	also had images that relate back to the circle of knowledge in the Daily Fud.
1671480	1673700	He had a bunch of photos up, you're right.
1673700	1680620	I'm trying to think now, was Gary really trying to get a food review out of him, or
1680620	1685940	was he following him around because of the circle of knowledge or something like that?
1685940	1687740	Was Gary following him around?
1687740	1691620	Gary was following Harold around, and Harold was following Maggie.
1691620	1693740	Well then I have a little theory then.
1693740	1701200	It seems that Harold might have been an amateur enthusiast in this sort of otherworldly knowledge,
1701200	1704640	but perhaps he wasn't really accepted by any of these groups.
1704640	1709400	The circle of knowledge probably didn't let him in, but he had some suspicions, so he's
1709400	1711720	following these people around.
1711720	1717360	Maggie's identified as this traitor perhaps in this note, and maybe he got some word of
1717360	1719500	that and that's why he was following her.
1719500	1724840	What if you, as another theory, take out the supernatural elements that we've discovered,
1724840	1729240	and he just found some connection between the cooks and Marvin?
1729240	1730240	That could be too.
1730240	1731240	Not bad, actually.
1731240	1732240	Occam's Razor.
1732240	1736600	Well, talking about Maggie, and I know we're bringing a lot of stuff up now, but you told
1736600	1745140	me, us, I suppose, that Maggie inducted you into this circle of knowledge.
1745140	1752200	If her dad is saying that, I mean, based off this envelope, that Maggie's not to be trusted.
1752200	1754480	She's gone rogue, perhaps.
1754480	1756300	What do you think about that?
1756300	1760900	What do we think about the order that our two Jim Cook's letters were written in?
1760900	1766220	Do you think that he suspected Maggie and then decided that the circle of knowledge
1766220	1772260	was full of the writings of a madman, or the scrawlings of a crazed man, or something like
1772260	1774260	that was in the first letter that we read?
1774260	1777660	Do you think, so, I'm sorry, do you think one led to the other, and which way do you
1777660	1778660	think it went?
1778660	1784720	I'd imagine that one came first, since he quotes his own phrase, faith through knowledge
1784720	1787920	is just called knowledge, at the start of this letter.
1787920	1792320	And perhaps his doubts in their book led Maggie to turn against him.
1792320	1796400	Well, I think the faith through knowledge is just knowledge is a circle of knowledge
1796400	1797400	slogan.
1797400	1799500	Maggie said it to me, actually, herself.
1799500	1802880	That's not a very good slogan.
1802880	1804680	Maggie said that to me pretty much verbatim.
1804680	1808960	She was telling me that she knew I had faith, and she needed me to have knowledge.
1808960	1811400	That's when she showed me that creature I told you about.
1811400	1816800	So, when I met Maggie, that's who I would be, that's who I would trust, but learning
1816800	1824540	all this new stuff, if her own father, if we've deciphered this correctly, her own fathers
1824540	1828880	may be saying that Maggie Cook can't be trusted.
1828880	1831520	How much trust do you have in Maggie Cook?
1831520	1832520	She's the chief, Keith.
1832520	1835560	I've always trusted her with my life, but the chief died.
1835560	1836560	We don't even know the focus Maggie Cook is.
1836560	1839680	I saw Maggie Cook, I don't even know what I saw.
1839680	1845520	I saw Maggie Cook dead, but you're saying that you saw her alive, and she inducted you
1845520	1851560	into this thing, and now I've got this letter telling us that she is not to be trusted.
1851560	1852920	What do we do about this?
1852920	1856540	Here's the thing is that whether or not she can be trusted, should be trusted, whether
1856540	1861880	it's her or not, the thing she showed me was real as day in my eyes.
1861880	1862880	I saw the thing.
1862880	1864520	It scared the daylights out of me.
1864520	1867000	But what if she's not showing you the whole truth?
1867000	1868880	They're only telling you part of her plans.
1868880	1875520	I'm just saying, if she's telling me that she wants to stop the thing, I would want
1875520	1876520	to stop the thing.
1876520	1879720	So, I mean, I guess she could be lying about wanting to stop it?
1879720	1880720	Well...
1880720	1881720	I don't know.
1881720	1883160	I want to stop the thing, fellas.
1883160	1884640	I agree with that as well.
1884640	1893560	I mean, we gotta stop the thing, and we can figure out all this, where any alliances lie
1893560	1897680	later on, but I think at the end of the day we gotta stop, you know, whatever's going
1897680	1898680	on.
1898840	1903080	I think Marvin Glass is our biggest problem at this point right now.
1903080	1905360	Well, he's our most addressable problem.
1905360	1906360	Exactly, John.
1906360	1907760	It's something we can do.
1907760	1913160	Well, and it's something that basically my alliance lies with him at basically blackmailing
1913160	1915600	me into being his ally.
1915600	1917480	You've just incurred a debt to him.
1917480	1918480	Right.
1918480	1920960	Well, and Kevin John, I mean, what's...
1920960	1922960	I don't have any loyalty to him, but...
1922960	1928640	And neither do you, so I think this is who we should be focusing on right now, and I
1928640	1932960	think we gotta head that way, and I still like our original plan that...
1932960	1936560	Is there any more documents in this room?
1936560	1940920	I'll tell you what Clark is wondering about, and so maybe he'll rifle through papers.
1940920	1945140	Can he find a connection between Jim and or Maggie to Marvin?
1945140	1949320	The only connection that you would be able to find in this room has already been laid
1949320	1956680	out, which is a folder that is labeled Operation Three Ring Binder, and has a dirty dog grooming
1956680	1958600	key fob inside of it.
1958600	1959760	Didn't Maggie have one of those?
1959760	1960760	I don't know.
1960760	1961760	Just John Peters.
1961760	1963000	How do we reckon that that's a connection?
1963000	1966320	Oh, I was just giving you a connection between this room and Marvin Glass.
1966320	1967320	Yeah.
1967320	1970760	Well, we're operating under the assumption that this room was Old Me's room, right?
1970760	1971760	Isn't that what we...
1971760	1972760	That's what I'm thinking.
1972760	1974560	Or it'd be pretty weird if it wasn't.
1974560	1976640	So he was collecting stuff about Jim Cook.
1976640	1977760	No, he wasn't.
1977760	1978920	He's living in Jim Cook's house.
1978920	1979920	He's just living in his house.
1979920	1980920	You're right.
1980920	1983400	It's probably a letter Jim Cook wrote to him, maybe, if he's part of the survey.
1988600	1990720	Boy, what the fuck?
1990720	1992120	Seconded.
1992120	1998840	Keith walks out the Keith-shaped hole in the wall and says, come on, boys.
1998840	1999840	Let's go.
1999840	2000840	Let's go to Marvin's.
2000840	2001940	This hole was made for me.
2001940	2002940	Let's go to the glass.
2002940	2004200	Let's go to the glass.
2004200	2005420	Let's do our plan.
2005420	2007000	We have a lot of new information.
2007000	2011320	There's nothing else that tells me we shouldn't just do this.
2011320	2012320	Do what exactly?
2012320	2013460	Do we have a...
2013460	2014520	We're going to Chewbacca you.
2014520	2015920	We're going to Chewbacca you.
2015920	2016920	We're going to...
2016920	2017920	But then what?
2018240	2019720	Oh, then we're going to probably kill everybody.
2019720	2024880	Yeah, I think we're going to have to have a shootout.
2024880	2028080	So maybe before we go to...
2028080	2030320	Well, what are we armed with now?
2030320	2035020	I got my small, powerful gun, but I've just got my service pistol.
2035020	2037240	Can we hit up a gun store in the city?
2037240	2038240	Yeah, for sure.
2038240	2043480	When you guys go downstairs, you would see we had those items sitting out on the kitchen
2043480	2044480	counter.
2044540	2046960	Make sure that we got that all accounted for.
2046960	2050180	The leather holster was grabbed by Jon.
2050180	2052380	The ring was grabbed by Keith.
2052380	2056520	Which is around a shoestring on my neck.
2056520	2057520	Absolutely.
2057520	2058640	One pube still hanging on.
2058640	2065660	And there is a Ziploc bag containing the single tarot card of the devil with several bullet
2065660	2069300	holes in it and a taxidermied baby squirrel.
2069300	2073840	And as you guys are re-looking over all this, you would notice now that you've seen Clark's
2073840	2078840	parents when they were young on the TV, you would recognize that there is a picture of
2078840	2082360	them on the fridge with Jim Cook.
2082360	2087160	They are posing with silly hats and Jim Cook is begrudgingly smiling.
2087160	2089680	Does that mean anything to you, Clark?
2089680	2090680	What?
2090680	2091680	This picture.
2091680	2092680	Oh yeah.
2092680	2094160	I didn't know that they knew each other.
2094160	2096080	No, I'd never seen that picture before.
2096080	2102320	Do you think that maybe they had... that maybe your parents weren't just Wheel of Fortune
2102320	2103320	players?
2103320	2108200	Maybe, I don't know, maybe we may all be connected in this somehow.
2108200	2111240	I just, yeah, I just don't know.
2111240	2114560	Seeing that picture on there, I just was surprised that they knew each other.
2114560	2116640	I just kind of thought it was neat.
2116640	2121160	It helped me believe that I was on the good side when Maggie showed up.
2121160	2122160	That's for sure.
2122160	2126520	My parents, it was nice to see the parents smiling once again.
2126520	2129120	Clark, did you grab that VHS tape?
2129120	2130120	I did not.
2130120	2131120	Okay.
2131120	2132120	I finished it though, right?
2132120	2133120	I saw everything that was on it.
2133120	2134120	Yeah.
2134120	2135520	Was there anything in it?
2135520	2142220	There's nothing like in the episode or anything that sparked any imagination there, but other
2142220	2144640	than just, you know, seeing your parents.
2144640	2152560	But you would notice when you looked at the tape itself, it has been played so many times.
2152560	2156520	That just made me sad.
2156520	2158940	Right on.
2158940	2165300	Maybe even like lifetimes of playing over and over again.
2165300	2172960	If we pretend that this baby squirrel is for sure from Julie Maxwell, does that mean anything?
2172960	2177140	Does that change anything for anybody or mean anything for anybody, if we take it as fact?
2177140	2181460	When I saw attacks at everything, I thought of Julie Maxwell, but it didn't really ping
2181460	2182900	anything in my brain.
2182900	2186180	Have we had any indication that she was in the circle of knowledge?
2186180	2188700	Was she in the circle of knowledge?
2188700	2189700	I don't...
2189700	2190700	Well, here's another thing.
2190700	2191700	I don't think so.
2191700	2196460	Speaking about that baby squirrel bag, that devil card, the devil tarot card, there was
2196460	2201460	a file at Marvin Glass's plates labeled Satan.
2201460	2208620	And all that was in it was a picture of a woman with short curly hair, shoulder length
2208620	2214620	maybe, and a mouth that took up half her face with a look of unbridled pleasure on it.
2214620	2215620	Did you know her?
2215620	2216620	No.
2217300	2220620	But I remember she had a big mouth because that's one of my favorite Netflix original
2220620	2223540	series.
2223540	2231740	It really gets to the heart of the torrid storm that rages in a young person's heart
2231740	2234100	and mind as they go through adolescence.
2234100	2235780	It gets to the hard on of the matter.
2235780	2238300	Yeah, there's a lot of boner stuff too.
2238300	2243500	Surprisingly, Keith Vigna does not like that television show.
2243500	2244500	You don't like Vigna?
2244500	2245500	Not really.
2246500	2250420	Edit, edit, edit, edit, edit.
2250420	2255340	It's like the only good show about middle school ever.
2255340	2258260	So devil, Satan, shot, tarot card...
2258260	2261660	Hold on, that just pisses me off because it makes me feel like you had a really chill
2261660	2264540	and easy adolescence.
2264540	2266740	I don't want to talk on this right now.
2266740	2267740	I want to keep playing the game.
2267740	2268740	I do want to talk on this.
2268740	2269740	I don't.
2269740	2270740	We can talk about it later.
2270740	2271740	How was your 8th grade just like really nice?
2271740	2272740	I just want to play the game.
2272740	2273740	I want to play the game.
2273740	2274740	Fuck you.
2274980	2276980	Luke never went through an awkward phase.
2279980	2281980	Why are you funny?
2281980	2285580	I just want to focus on what we're doing right now.
2285580	2287780	I'm into it.
2287780	2289620	Devil card with bullet holes through it.
2289620	2290980	You saw a Satan file.
2290980	2293500	I mean, I don't know what that means.
2293500	2297660	Well, it's just the last time I saw something, you know, tangentially related to the devil.
2297660	2298660	So I thought I'd bring it up.
2298660	2299660	Gotcha.
2299660	2302540	Seems like maybe both sides of this are eyeing someone.
2302540	2303540	Hail Satan.
2303540	2304540	That they, yeah.
2305340	2306340	Can I inspect the card a little more?
2306340	2308580	Is there anything else I can glean from it that maybe I missed?
2308580	2315940	As you pull the card out of the bag, your fingers go over each ridge where the bullet
2315940	2322100	holes have struck through it and you feel the ridges and you look at the card and it
2322100	2327340	is a tarot card with bullet holes in it.
2327340	2331020	Got me again.
2331020	2332540	Those two things are on my person.
2332540	2336980	Oh, so back to my hypothetical, does, does Jim Cook owning a thing that Julie Maxwell
2336980	2339100	might have made change anything for anybody?
2339100	2340100	No.
2340100	2344380	I mean, nothing actually connect indicates that they knew each other, but maybe I can't
2344380	2345380	think of anything.
2345380	2346380	All right.
2346380	2348140	I pocket that bag with the contents inside.
2348140	2349140	Okay.
2349140	2350140	Boys.
2350140	2352100	I'm about to storm the gates.
2352100	2353700	You want to go?
2353700	2365460	I mean, we had a arm ourselves and, uh, I think we play it by ear once we get inside.
2365460	2371220	I mean, we, we got our, we got our, we got our, our idea of getting into the depths of
2371220	2377260	Marvin glasses compound, but once we get in there, Clark, you're probably not going to
2377260	2378260	be armed.
2378260	2382300	Cause I mean, unless, unless there's something that you can hide away, cause you're our,
2382300	2385740	you're going to be our, our, we drag them in there.
2385740	2387020	He can be loaded to the teeth.
2387020	2391800	I mean, the second we reveal our, our deception, he starts firing too.
2391800	2395440	So I think you should be as secretly armed as you can.
2395440	2399660	But if they disagree, I mean, it should be hidden, but it's not like we should send them
2399660	2400660	in lightly armed.
2400660	2402280	No, no, I don't think so either.
2402280	2406420	But at the end of the day, you, you may be unarmed.
2406420	2407660	You won't be unarmed Clark.
2407660	2408660	Don't worry.
2408660	2411980	I'm going to fucking, but that's what I'm saying.
2411980	2416020	That's what I'm, I'm just preparing for the worst is you get stripped of your arms.
2416020	2417460	We are armed up enough.
2417460	2420820	We throw you something, but we're going to have to fight our way out of the middle of
2420820	2424600	what I'm saying, man, is the second anybody comes at him to like search him.
2424600	2425640	That's when we start shooting.
2425640	2426940	I don't think so.
2426940	2429660	I think we get all the way to Martin glass until we start shooting.
2429660	2430660	Yeah.
2430660	2432820	If it's, if they frisk us at the front door, I don't think we're not going to start shooting
2432820	2433820	through the front door.
2433820	2436540	We're going to wait till we get to our pass a speech check or something.
2436540	2439220	Again, we can come to it when we come to it.
2439220	2440220	Okay.
2440260	2442020	Preparing you preparing for the worst.
2442020	2443020	That's all I'm saying.
2443020	2444020	I think you worry too much.
2444020	2445020	I'll put a, the world's going to hell.
2445020	2448740	I'll put a, man, John actually kind of a group of Keith on this one.
2448740	2451940	If they frisk us and I've got guns on me, if they're going to ask why you didn't take
2451940	2453860	them, we just kill those guys at the door.
2453860	2455140	I don't like, no.
2455140	2457340	And then we start a shootout and we don't win it.
2457340	2459100	I think we need to get all the way.
2459100	2462580	I think we get all the way to Martin glass before we do anything.
2462580	2467540	We throw a couple of guns to him at the end of the day because they frisk him.
2467580	2473220	They look at us and they, I mean, they trust us enough, but not more than they trust anybody
2473220	2474340	else that works there.
2474340	2477280	So I'm thinking he goes in unarmed.
2477280	2479200	We go in real armed.
2479200	2483460	If they ask us why we got arms on us, then we say, cause we got this guy.
2483460	2485880	He's he's not armed, but he's dangerous.
2485880	2489780	The other members of the glass family or his henchmen or whatever, does everybody know
2489780	2494020	that you're John Lee Pettymore in Kevin's body or that no one knows that.
2494020	2498980	So you, it seemed when we were up in our cages, had a kind of the run of the thing.
2498980	2499980	Exactly.
2499980	2500980	You're like captain to him.
2500980	2501980	Yeah.
2501980	2504700	I'm way higher up than new Charles.
2504700	2506180	I think they're going to trust me.
2506180	2509740	And the only exception is if Rosemary has come back and she thinks we're working against
2509740	2513620	them now, which that might make it hard to get in in the first place.
2513620	2517120	But I think we can bullshit our way past anybody trying to frisk you.
2517120	2518120	You can throw it.
2518120	2519120	Yeah.
2519120	2520120	You could throw your perceived weight around.
2520120	2521120	Exactly.
2521220	2525160	If they, you know, if they find the guns on you, we just say, we're getting you here in
2525160	2529060	a hurry and thanks for finding them and taking them off of them and we'll collect them and
2529060	2530060	move on.
2530060	2531060	I agree.
2531060	2532060	Okay.
2532060	2533060	I'm good with that.
2533060	2534060	Let's go buy some guns.
2534060	2535060	Let's head over to the glass compound.
2535060	2536060	What's that?
2536060	2537060	The gun store first.
2537060	2538060	The gun store.
2538060	2539060	The gun store, I mean.
2539060	2540060	And then the glass compound.
2540060	2550260	Welcome to large Eddie's gun emporium.
2550400	2551720	What's the largest gun you got?
2551720	2552720	Large Eddie.
2552720	2553720	Oh, this one right here.
2553720	2557040	It's the, it's the cutter in half.
2557040	2558040	Cutter in half?
2558040	2560840	Barely newer in half.
2560840	2562840	I step up to the counter.
2562840	2568960	I've got my only gun on me is my large and powerful gun, but I'd like to have like a,
2568960	2573920	like an assault rifle on me, like military fully auto assault rifle.
2573920	2576000	I want to purchase one of those.
2576000	2577000	Okay.
2577000	2578800	Do you have a money?
2578800	2579800	I.
2580340	2583220	I've got a, I've got a Marvin glass company card.
2583220	2584220	Yeah.
2584220	2585220	Well, we're okay.
2585220	2591060	I've got the credit card in my wallet as a, as John Lee Pettymore says that the guy, his
2591060	2596420	ears kind of perk up and he's like, Oh, uh, actually if you guys want to come on back
2596420	2599420	here and he, uh, kicks the back door open.
2599420	2600420	Thank you.
2600420	2601420	Large Eddie.
2601420	2607940	You guys walk into the back room and it is right into his trap.
2607940	2613040	It's literally, it's just a trap door.
2613040	2619460	Next week on pretending to be people, it's just us falling for 30 minutes, spy kids.
2619460	2621160	They're going to talk about what to do next.
2621160	2629080	Uh, as they're falling, you guys walk back into a room that is a plethora of a madman's
2629080	2630080	dreams.
2630080	2635080	What kind of guns do does Keith, does Keith see that he, that he likes?
2635080	2639820	I don't know anything about guns, but it's all the cool ones.
2639820	2642480	You get big ones and small ones, red ones and blue ones.
2642480	2646820	There's some with cool sights on them and others have silencers and there's some big
2646820	2647820	ones.
2647820	2648820	There's some shotguns.
2648820	2656300	So Keith, Keith eyes, a large submachine gun and it's kind of glowing and I stepped up
2656300	2657900	to that one and I touch it.
2657900	2662340	It's kind of like cold to the touch and I asked big Eddie, what's this one?
2662340	2663580	Oh, uh, yeah, sorry.
2663580	2668480	And he flips a switch and turns off the light that's right behind it.
2668480	2671160	And he's like, oh, it's just, that's just a real big gun.
2671160	2673080	That's a nice cold gun.
2673080	2674760	Cold fusion gun.
2674760	2677040	It works in cold weather.
2677040	2680100	Is it, is it a fusion?
2680100	2681100	Is it a fusion?
2681100	2682100	Good.
2682100	2683100	No, it just means it works good in cold.
2683100	2686540	It's the cold fusion brand firearm.
2686540	2688040	You never heard of cold fusion?
2688040	2691640	The most murderous pieces this side of the Mississippi.
2691640	2693120	Capital C, capital F.
2693120	2698540	I pick it up and it's about a, it's like a two ARs combined into each other.
2698540	2699540	Fully out.
2699540	2704660	Oh, I pick it up, throw it on his card and I sling it across my back because it's already
2704660	2707380	got a leather strap on it.
2707380	2708380	Ooh, that's nice.
2708380	2710900	I want to grab just a few pistols.
2710900	2711900	You grab a few pistols.
2711900	2715620	You got him tucked into the waistband and maybe one in the boot, one in the butt, one
2715620	2716620	in the boot.
2717120	2723880	I want to grab a powerful pistol with a, with a large magazine and a semi-automatic shotgun.
2723880	2729600	You grab the two of those large Eddie bows in reverence and you all leave.
2729600	2734600	Before we leave your gun emporium, do you have any, any smoke grenades, regular grenades,
2734600	2735600	flash bangs?
2735600	2736600	Yeah.
2736600	2740200	I'd like two of each for all my friends and me.
2740200	2744440	Two of each for all your friends, smoke, flash, and bang.
2744440	2746440	What are the?
2746440	2755820	Smoke, flash, bang, and regular fragmentation, original, original recipe.
2755820	2756820	Original flavor.
2756820	2757820	Yeah.
2757820	2758820	All right.
2758820	2764140	How are you guys approaching this concept to get into the glass?
2764140	2769540	That is, I think we go right into the front wherever.
2769540	2770540	Yeah.
2770540	2775820	So I know pretty well how to get us through there if we go in through the den of sin through
2775820	2778480	the dirty dog room and uh, the street access.
2778480	2779480	Okay.
2779480	2784160	So I, I think I can sneak us pretty deep into this place if we, uh, so we wouldn't even
2784160	2786640	have to like meet some folks at the front door.
2786640	2787680	I like that idea.
2787680	2793180	And then we can walk in there and as soon as we do, as soon as we meet any kind of resistance,
2793180	2796820	we just say, Hey, we're taking this man personally to see Marvin Glass.
2796820	2801920	He murdered, uh, not to be the broken record here, but then what say we get all the way
2801920	2803320	straight to Marvin.
2803320	2806240	We shoot our way out.
2806240	2808300	We kind of want to talk them a little bit, don't we?
2808300	2811980	I mean, yeah, we just got to prove that we can kill the people protecting him.
2811980	2819020	So we might have to do that, but I honestly, there's like a, there's probably a 66% chance
2819020	2823180	that this ends in our glorious deaths.
2823180	2825860	I'll take the 34.
2825860	2828860	You think it's that high that we, well, I think here's the deal.
2828860	2832300	We, we have a shoe that we don't kill Marvin Glass.
2832300	2834280	We shoot everybody around him.
2834280	2838120	If we got to shoot him, we injure him, but we talked to him.
2838120	2839120	Maybe he's valuable.
2839120	2840120	Maybe he's not.
2840120	2841120	We kill him.
2841120	2844760	We shoot our way out or sneak our way out and then we head straight to contention.
2844760	2845760	It's what I think.
2845760	2846760	Try to find Drew.
2846760	2851960	You guys are discussing this as you drive into the heart of the city where John Lee
2851960	2859000	Pettymore knows the alleyway in order to get in to the den of sin and the three of you
2859000	2865600	strapped up exactly how you want to be prepared for what you're diving into.
2865600	2871700	You go and step on this large grate on the ground in this alleyway.
2871700	2877300	John Lee Pettymore pulls the dirty dog grooming key fob out of his hand and lifts it up.
2877300	2882100	And with that, the three of you do fall through a trap door and begin falling.
