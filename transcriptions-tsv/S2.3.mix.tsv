0	3080	Howdy-doody, my spooky-poopies.
3080	8680	It's your turd-blasting, time-traveling, greasy, and parental figure wolf, the dog.
8680	14240	And I'm here to provide sustenance to all of my little baby buddies.
14240	18920	I'm tootin' at y'all live from 694.2 PTBP,
18920	26280	the city's only radio station that also doubles as a crawdaddy bio-farm on the weekends.
26280	32440	If we eat only the crawdaddies, what happens to all the crawmommies?
32440	37760	Speakin' of weird shit that I'm forced to read that makes people mildly uncomfortable,
37760	40560	this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Kyle.
40560	43680	Remember, listener, Kyle asked for this.
43680	45280	Kyle writes,
45280	48200	To my darling wife, Steffy.
48200	51600	Hundland, Hundland.
51600	52960	Ow!
52960	55400	Cough, cough, cough.
55400	58480	Hundland, Hundland.
58480	61720	Uh... thanks for that, Kyle.
61720	63840	I hope your wife enjoyed that.
63840	65560	I know I did.
65560	68680	At certain parts, but mostly I didn't.
68680	73280	If you wanna write up somethin' for your guttural wolf to how,
73280	76360	tag at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram,
76360	78800	tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook,
78800	83040	or write up a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice.
83040	88080	Screenshot them deliciousnesses and send them my way.
88080	93560	If you refuse to post on social media, but you still wanna support the show,
93560	98080	give us money in exchange for a whole bunch of bonus episodes,
98080	101880	access to submit NPCs and locations,
101880	104680	behind-the-scenes livestreams,
104680	107080	exclusive T-shirts,
107080	109840	and et cetera, et cetera.
109840	113760	It also helps give Zach the little bits of sausage he needs
113760	119160	that keep him goin' as he produces, GMs, and edits this fine show.
119160	122800	Links to all that and Wolfie's merch store are,
122800	126000	you guessed it, in the show notes.
126000	129360	For those just tunin' in, I'm Wolf the Dog.
129360	133720	You are listening to 694.2 PTBP,
133720	136400	and this is the news.
136400	141840	Last time, we learned about the new field producer, Julius Summers,
141840	146640	and his childhood connection to the City Action News Studios.
146640	151560	And when Julius was a child, crawlin' around gnawin' on marbles that were,
151560	154640	of course, securely fastened to the floor,
154680	160640	Well, back then, Cal Colorado was the frothy film of the slot bucket, my babies.
160640	162680	He was on top.
162680	166240	His trusty field camera operator, Beck Wilder,
166240	169600	sided with Julius against Cal Colorado
169600	173600	when the team was asked to follow a lead that Cal balked at.
173600	175840	Let's see if we can top that.
175840	178360	Here's a brand new rock act.
178360	184400	It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
184400	187240	And it's all my fault
188520	192840	Cos my life is great
193480	195480	And it's all mine
202960	207120	Cos my life is great
207880	210520	And it's all my fault
214400	222600	I never record the good jokes.
222600	225800	I swear, that's not what this podcast is about.
225800	228840	I've got a month of Bumble Premium.
228840	230880	Hell yeah, dude. Find somebody in to piss play.
230880	233120	Did they maybe give you the first month free?
233120	238480	No, no, no. My phone did this in my pocket while we were at brunch,
238480	240360	looking at the charge.
240560	244480	Cos I was talking to somebody and stuck my phone in my pocket while we were messaging.
244480	246800	Oh no, how much?
246800	249240	30 bucks. Could be worse.
249240	251360	That's still insane for a month.
251360	253600	That is insane for a month.
253600	255480	But I was hoping, oh wow.
255480	259080	You just made me feel fine about this, I guess.
259080	262240	No, actually I don't. That's almost an eighth of weed. Fuck that.
262240	267920	I was gonna hit up my person today.
267920	271760	And instead I have a month of Bumble Premium.
275640	278080	I guess I'm gonna have to make the most of this.
278080	280680	Yeah dude, go fucking wild on Bumble now.
280680	283080	Fucking unlimited swipes.
283080	284880	What is Bumble?
284880	287160	Bumble's the one where the women message you first.
287160	288360	Oh, okay. Got you.
288360	291880	So you never get like anything live?
291880	294760	No, no. It's all a trick.
294760	296520	I don't think they're real.
296520	302320	Yeah, mine was broken, I think.
302320	306560	Welcome to episode three of Pretending to Be People.
306560	311600	I could add weed, y'all.
311600	316800	Instead I might get a life partner.
316800	319320	Fuck me.
319320	320520	How's it going?
320520	323160	Oh, it's fine.
323160	327960	You know, a little miffed.
327960	329440	I've been scrolling through TikTok,
329440	333760	disappointed that Kan hasn't updated in a while.
333760	335840	City Action News, if this is your first time
335840	336880	listening to the podcast.
336880	338960	Also go back and listen to episode one.
338960	340560	If this is your first episode,
340560	343080	this is the perfect time to go back a couple episodes.
343080	344480	We only got three now.
344480	346360	This is the only time where we can say
346360	347480	just go back a couple.
347480	350680	Now is the easiest time to make sure you go back now.
350680	353480	If you're in the next episode listening for the first time
353480	355040	and you go back a couple,
355040	358840	ooh, I'd rather you went back a few.
358840	363440	Hey, fair point, but it's not like we're at 10.
363440	364760	It's not like we're at 10.
364760	369520	I don't have a fun folksy word for nine.
369520	371360	Say it like Mr. Lemon.
371360	376120	Well, I say you have to go back nine episodes.
376120	377640	Did you like that? Say it like the editor.
377680	380960	Oh, well, you'd have to go back nine episodes.
380960	383280	Was any a little weird? Vivica?
383280	385080	Oh, who was the guy who sounded weird?
385080	386320	Do you mean Jeremy?
386320	387840	Oh, the intern.
387840	388800	Oh yeah, I do.
388800	389640	Yeah.
390640	393160	Oh, speaking of Jeremy,
393160	395280	this episode starts with a shot of Jeremy
395280	397160	standing in the parking lot,
397160	399640	standing in the empty spot where the can van
399640	404560	just was holding a hot iced latte
404560	406840	and two energy drinks.
407800	411240	It's about now in the van that Beck remembers that,
411240	413920	oh, damn it, we forgot our drinks.
413920	415000	Damn it.
415000	418880	And he begins sprinting down the road
418880	421640	through traffic holding these three items.
421640	422480	We didn't get very far, did we?
422480	423320	We did not get very far.
423320	424160	We're stuck.
424160	426600	I said that you got pretty much trapped in gridlock
426600	428120	almost immediately.
428120	430200	So let's see the inside of this van.
430200	431720	Hey, does the city suck?
431720	436240	Oh, I mean, you're here at what?
436240	440320	Like 6 p.m. in the middle of downtown.
440320	441280	Shit is.
441280	442120	So?
442120	442960	Shit's fucked.
442960	445320	Right, and when he says, does the city suck?
445320	447360	That's actually the beginning of the TikTok.
447360	450080	He's asking the person in front of us in their car
450080	451640	that question.
451640	452480	What?
452480	453680	Does the city suck?
453680	456960	I don't think Cal Colorado would ever say those words.
456960	457800	Yeah.
459320	461040	We've only known him for two episodes,
461040	464040	but there's no fucking way Cal Colorado's saying that.
465040	467560	But you could try to talk him into it and scene.
469120	470040	Wait, that's at the end.
470040	471240	How do you start one?
471240	472800	Fire.
472800	473640	Fire.
476360	478000	That's why you don't yell fire in a theater
478000	479840	because they'll think it means well.
479840	481360	It's time to start.
481360	483080	Fire!
483080	486000	Beck is holding the phone ready to film a TikTok,
486000	487840	but he still doesn't have a clear idea
487840	491000	of what he's looking to the producer for guidance.
491000	493220	Julius is scrambling for ideas
493260	494740	and just kind of looking around
494740	498700	and he sees a pizza at Cal's own shop.
499580	500740	And he looks at Cal.
500740	502220	Oh my God.
502220	503060	And he looks back.
503060	503900	And he looks back.
503900	504740	Oh my God.
504740	506100	Oh my God.
506100	509420	Cal is blinking and smiling and here at TikTok,
509420	510900	so he's telling you the time.
513340	516900	Cal, how do you feel about eating something?
516900	520460	I had a sensible lunch and breakfast.
520460	523780	I, no, I don't think I could eat right now.
523780	525260	Just a bite or two.
525260	526500	I'm sorry, I don't know if you've noticed,
526500	528740	but I do keep my figure trim.
528740	531140	Then let's ask these people some questions.
531140	533340	And I just point to like people walking.
533340	534740	Man on the street, I love it.
534740	538260	You see a guy who with a massive beanie,
538260	542940	it's like way too big and it's drooped over his eyes almost.
542940	546780	He's walking like he's sitting down, but he's walking.
546780	547800	And-
547800	548740	I'm sorry, Zach, what?
548740	550340	He's walking like he's sitting down,
551180	552000	but he's walking.
552000	552840	So he's ass-
552840	553660	You've seen people, right?
553660	554500	Oh man.
555500	557260	His ass is like even with his knees.
557260	558100	Yeah, he's like-
558100	559340	Zach, what do you think walking?
559340	562420	He's just like squat walking
562420	564980	and kind of like dancing around.
564980	566260	Cal has a microphone in his face.
566260	567580	You, sir, what are you doing?
567580	568420	Roll, roll, roll.
568420	570460	Hey, I'm just dancing, I'm dancing.
570460	572360	And he's just kind of doing this weird,
572360	575140	like sitting dance thing, like a silly walk.
575140	576820	And he's just like, you know,
576820	578980	I like to get through the city by dancing.
578980	580180	You see these cars here?
581060	581900	They're stuck.
581900	583020	I'm not stuck.
583020	583940	I'm free.
583940	587140	You're never stuck if you have your legs.
587140	588980	A disturbingly ableist message.
591740	592740	From the Cal zone.
592740	593780	From the Cal zone.
595180	597420	Hey, Cal, how about instead of that,
597420	601700	we try like you try to dance like him with him.
601700	602740	That might be amusing.
602740	604260	He reaches out for your hand.
604260	606500	Oh, a street man.
606500	607840	Okay.
607840	610060	Cal takes his hand, but then yeah,
610780	611660	Cal is nailing it.
611660	613220	Cal is like athletic.
614480	615320	Awesome.
617500	620260	Cal watches this guy move and then moves like that.
620260	623860	The Cal zone is a thing that you had already coined
623860	625280	in your basketball days.
629900	632140	Well, yeah, I mean, I played some D
632140	635860	and when they got in the Cal zone, they got slapped down.
635860	637060	Your sign off needs to be,
637060	640340	and that's another slam dunk from the Cal zone.
640340	642540	That's some more hot D from the Cal zone.
642540	644020	Oh yeah.
644020	646380	That's a wild catchphrase.
646380	647860	Just like my basketball dance.
650180	651940	Beck stops filming and on TikTok,
651940	653860	he's doing, he's maybe adding a filter
653860	655380	and he's putting the text over the top
655380	657860	and it's when you in the Cal zone.
657860	659540	Oh, fuck yeah, dude.
659540	660620	That face when.
660620	661720	What's the song?
662780	663780	Whoop, there it is.
663780	668780	Oh, fuck yeah, whoop, there it is, whoop, there it is.
671900	674380	Before I hit send, I give it to Julius.
674380	678620	Julius adds, Julius looks at it and looks at Beck
678620	682000	like just stoked that it's perfect.
682000	687000	And he just adds the caption, another fresh hot Cal zone.
688820	690660	Fuck yes.
690660	692620	As soon as it's blasted out,
692620	695360	literally the second it posts a TikTok,
695360	698580	you get a notification on your cell phone, Julius
698580	703460	and Tife has hearted the message that he sent you.
703460	704300	Oh, the-
704300	705660	Make a TikTok, bitch.
705660	706500	Oh, right.
706500	709300	I text him back, like open the news tonight
709300	712360	saying that we posted a TikTok or something like that.
712360	713200	Like make-
713200	716220	Open the news tonight, saying that we posted a TikTok,
716220	717180	something like that.
718380	719480	Or something.
720480	723280	Breaking news, a new TikTok is dropped.
725640	729740	As you guys are all reconvened, as you were all-
730920	732120	Recalvened.
735240	738020	After you've all recalvened back in the can van.
739320	740160	Jesus.
741480	743180	Can we start the season two over?
747360	748820	I'm not feeling the can van.
750480	755480	You see a man running, sprinting in between two lanes
755480	758820	of traffic in the rear view mirror on the can van.
758820	763820	And he is holding one hot ice latte and two energy drinks.
764360	766800	And he approaches the van and he's like,
774240	778360	Okay, I got your hot ice latte.
778360	781180	They were not happy about that order, Julius,
781180	782020	but I got it funny.
782020	784440	He takes it and he's surprised that it is somehow
784440	787180	both very hot and very cold.
787180	788440	And here are these for you, Beck.
788440	789260	Hell yeah, man.
789260	792160	I almost had to go to the backups and he pets the backpack
792160	794200	that he has with him that has a bunch of extra cans
794200	795040	of energy drink.
795040	797940	And a patch with energy drink on it.
797940	801560	Cal has Julius's phone and he's just watching the TikTok
801560	803880	like repeatedly with a huge grin on his face.
803880	805000	Awesome.
805000	808240	And he kind of like absentmindedly notices
809080	810640	that the intern has run up and he's like,
810640	812880	and if you could get me a black coffee, please.
818480	821800	Cal, you get a text message at the exact same time
821800	822760	as Julius.
822760	826920	It's a group text between Taif, Cal and Julius.
826920	830500	And he says, her name is Kaylee Silver.
830500	833600	Shout out to Distant Egg Song in Houston.
833600	834440	Hey.
834440	837500	For Kaylee Silver, we'll likely meet her soon.
837500	841760	Kaylee Silver, it says, specifically asked for Cal
841760	846660	because he is a truth above all type of guy.
846660	851540	She grew up watching him on TV and she trusts him.
851540	854180	So that first thing he likes,
854180	856100	then I grew up watching you on TV.
856100	857100	That gives him pause.
857100	857940	Sure.
857940	858760	He's heard that.
858760	859900	That can go a lot of ways.
859900	861220	And as you're reading that text,
861220	863940	immediately back is Jeremy.
864820	867220	Whew, wowzer.
867780	869460	Yeah, that is a hot black coffee.
869460	872700	The quickest coffee run, I time myself, thank you,
872700	874980	that I have ever made.
874980	877180	Thankfully, because, and he points behind him.
877180	878780	The Cal zone plays sold coffee.
879820	881220	I went to the U zone.
883020	885060	Oh, thank you, Jeremy.
885060	886520	Cal kind of realizes what he's done.
886520	889540	He like realizes they're in the street and not the office
889540	891400	and gives him a big thumbs up.
891400	895460	And he thumbs ups back and then sprints off backwards
895460	896740	from where he came from.
897500	898940	He sprints backwards.
901740	904020	I think we found our first horror mystery.
904020	905620	I said what I said.
905620	908860	Yeah, and he's sitting while he does it for five seconds.
908860	912540	So we could talk to this weird pervert
912540	915500	or we could go find out what's going on
915500	916940	with backwards running, man.
918860	923860	Traffic moves at a snail's pace for like 15 minutes.
924860	927180	And then eventually it kind of opens up
927180	929140	and you guys get to your destination
929140	931580	in a matter of like five minutes.
931580	935660	It is a mid-rise, downtown in the city.
935660	937780	And on that piece of paper that you have
937780	940680	says apartment 836.
941980	944820	I pull the van up and park right in front.
944820	946900	Beck hops out and is already getting some B-roll
946900	948460	of the outside of the building.
948460	950580	But he's also bringing everything he's gonna need.
950580	952460	So he's got a tripod under an arm
952500	955340	and his case of camera equipment.
955340	956220	What's Cal doing?
956220	959020	What's running through his mind?
959020	960740	I was talking to this girl on Bumble
960740	962180	and we've hooked up a couple times
962180	964500	and she was like,
964500	966820	hey, this guy just sent me this really weird dick pic
966820	968780	and I don't know if it's like diseased or what.
968780	972780	And I was like, well, I kind of want to see that.
972780	974180	And she just sent it to me.
974180	976260	You did not want to see that, no.
976260	977100	Oh man.
979340	980660	Cal has a crazy life.
980700	982940	Yeah, we all make decisions.
985260	986740	I'm not sure I would have made that one.
986740	989060	Was that like a play of some sort?
989060	992740	Of like just showing off your personality early?
992740	995900	No, again, this is a person I've had sex with.
995900	997900	Yeah, like he could have that.
1004900	1006060	That's what I thought.
1006060	1007620	No, no, no.
1007620	1009860	She was like this dude sent me a dick pic
1009900	1011540	and it looked really weird.
1011540	1013820	Is it the dick pic that you sent her?
1015220	1020220	No, I'm about to send her one to show her a normal dick.
1021060	1023020	Cool, that was a question mark.
1025260	1026660	Did you look at it again, you freak?
1026660	1029380	Oh no, she just sent a description of it.
1029380	1030460	Hot.
1030460	1032020	It's got a weird texture.
1032020	1033940	Sounds like Bumble Premium is worth it.
1033940	1034780	Yeah.
1035700	1040700	She's like doesn't it look like a tongue and it does.
1044420	1047700	Well, that's going to be in season two somewhere.
1047700	1049620	Doesn't it look like a tongue?
1049620	1052220	And it does.
1052220	1053380	It won't be a dick though.
1053380	1054580	You guys want to see this dick?
1054580	1055660	No.
1055660	1056500	Not really.
1056500	1057340	Good call.
1059340	1061500	I'm sorry, I'm going to pee.
1061500	1064660	I'm kind of bummed out by my own decisions.
1065580	1066420	Fucking idiot.
1080380	1081380	Why did I have taste buds?
1081380	1084620	Did you go to the bathroom to jerk off to that picture?
1084620	1085460	Yes.
1086780	1088380	That's why it took me 20 seconds.
1088380	1089460	Fucking pervert.
1089460	1090860	Where the fuck were we?
1090860	1093420	Well, I was jacking off to that dick pic in your bathroom.
1093420	1095620	Let's start with me getting out of the van doing B-roll
1095620	1097380	and you're asking Cal what he was doing.
1097380	1099300	Yeah, that's what I was doing.
1099300	1102900	I asked Cal what he was doing and then we got into that.
1102900	1103820	Julius, what are you doing
1103820	1106620	as you guys approach this mid-rise?
1106620	1109300	Julius is going to go in and wait for Beck
1109300	1112020	to get some B-roll of him hitting the eight button
1112020	1112940	on the elevator.
1116220	1118980	Yeah, so people know where she lives.
1118980	1122100	No, just not for this story, but for, you know,
1122140	1123820	you can always use B-roll.
1123820	1124980	Oh yeah, that's good.
1124980	1126900	Beck is always, the B-roll doesn't have to be
1126900	1127740	for that story.
1127740	1130020	Like videography is his passion
1130020	1133620	and he knows that he's always filming for stories these days
1133620	1135700	but he likes to keep a collection of stuff
1135700	1137140	he could use for art projects.
1137140	1142140	And he's just kind of like elevator button projects.
1143180	1145500	Yeah, that's why Julius was keeping him in mind.
1145500	1148580	He's like, is there anything that could be like a quick shot?
1148580	1149420	Oh yeah.
1149420	1151300	You're familiar with his YouTube page.
1152020	1154020	I had to do my research before I worked here.
1154020	1157240	Joe, when you said like you were, Beck is always filming.
1157240	1160580	I definitely pictured a John Wilson how-to situation.
1160580	1161860	It's not funny.
1161860	1164540	Yeah, well, I mean, he was an inspiration
1164540	1167420	as far as the idea that he's always filming stuff.
1167420	1168900	He inspired how-to John Wilson.
1168900	1170300	Who knows how or when he'll use it.
1170300	1173300	Exactly, Beck inspired John Wilson.
1173300	1176180	Beck's like hot underground YouTube,
1176180	1180100	experimental YouTube page inspired John Wilson
1180100	1181380	to make how-to.
1181380	1183640	As you guys make it to the front of the building,
1183640	1187100	the doorman sees that your city action news
1187100	1189340	and opens the door and lets you get in.
1189340	1191100	Are you sure you don't want us to have like a 10 minute
1191100	1193220	interaction with the doorman?
1193220	1194460	Where we try to get in?
1194460	1196500	Julius, you're in the elevator now,
1196500	1199900	you're on your way up to the eighth floor of this building.
1199900	1201920	And when the elevator door opens,
1201920	1206220	you are in a stagnant, stale hallway.
1206260	1210740	It smells like old cigarettes and Chinese food.
1210740	1211900	It's not a bad smell.
1211900	1213940	It's kind of comforting if you're me,
1213940	1215100	but if you're me.
1217100	1218440	I lived in an apartment building
1218440	1220660	that smelled exactly like this.
1220660	1222960	It's not comforting at all to Julius.
1222960	1224580	It's propulsive even.
1224580	1227620	He grew up with marble floors and privilege.
1227620	1231540	And the carpet in the hallways of this apartment building
1231540	1236540	is only made more timely in its interior design
1237220	1240420	by the wallpaper that lines these hallways.
1240420	1243400	It feels almost suffocating.
1243400	1248400	Apartments 809 to 814 are to the left
1249300	1253460	and then 819 to 836 are to the right.
1253460	1258060	Kaylee Silver in apartment 836 will be to the right.
1258060	1259180	We go to the right.
1259180	1260620	How do you knock on the door?
1262500	1267340	Apparently this is an important aspect of season two.
1267340	1268900	So how do you knock on the door?
1268900	1272260	Oh God that scared the shit out of me.
1272260	1275940	I get my TikTok out and hand it over to him
1275940	1278140	and I'm like, get like the surprise on her face
1278140	1279940	when he knocks at the door.
1284660	1286360	You hear the heavy breathing coming
1286360	1287940	from the other side of the door.
1287940	1289620	Cal makes this big step back.
1291540	1294540	Shh, is it Cal?
1294540	1296620	Yes ma'am, this is Cal Colorado.
1296620	1297820	Wow, okay cool.
1298980	1301080	My name is Kaylee Silver.
1301080	1302340	I'm in a lot of trouble.
1303220	1304860	Can you help me?
1304860	1307140	Well, I'd love to see what I can do ma'am.
1307140	1308420	Could you let us in?
1308420	1311740	Unlock, chain unlock, deadbolt unlock.
1311740	1312980	Is she saying all that?
1313980	1316060	As Kaylee Silver pulls the three of you
1316060	1318940	into apartment 836 and shuts the door,
1318940	1321420	this 20 or 30 something and a choker necklace
1322260	1324540	repositions a towel against the door's threshold
1324540	1327860	and your noses tell your brains to tell you why.
1327860	1330900	It smells like death in this apartment
1330900	1333780	and there, strewn over the armrest of the couch
1333780	1337700	is a sight that could affect your grip on reality.
1337700	1342260	You see a pair of legs and your mind fills in the rest.
1342260	1345060	I grab my phone back from you
1345060	1346540	so that you can get your camera out.
1346540	1348100	But there's a little bit of resistance
1348100	1351780	that Beck was getting a shot of it instinctually.
1351780	1355180	I want you guys to picture Seinfeld's apartment for this.
1355180	1356740	That way we know where everything is.
1356740	1358980	Are you familiar with the impossible geometry
1358980	1360100	of Cherry Siderealm?
1360100	1364480	Okay, roll grip.
1368900	1370980	All right, but for real, I need everyone to roll grip
1370980	1373380	which is your grip on reality.
1373380	1376180	It is directly attached to the score of power.
1376220	1378260	Power times five is gonna be your grip.
1378260	1380820	We're replacing the word sanity in this campaign.
1380820	1382260	Because we've found it problematic.
1382260	1384260	And we really like the word grip.
1384260	1385260	Losing your grip.
1385260	1386100	It's cool.
1386100	1387220	Yeah, we like it a lot.
1387220	1391140	Plus maybe if in some instance we have,
1391140	1393740	I don't know, some kind of situation in the past,
1393740	1395180	you could really make it old timey.
1395180	1396220	Oh yeah.
1396220	1398740	Oh, you could make that word anything you want.
1398740	1399860	Almost anything, yeah.
1401380	1402580	We might have an array.
1402580	1404140	It'd be really fun to do one of the 30s.
1404140	1404980	I don't know what you're planning.
1404980	1405820	Foxy.
1407340	1410060	I mean, that's more of a teens, but yeah.
1410060	1411860	You guys can play teens, whatever.
1414340	1415940	So, I need you all to roll grip.
1415940	1416780	I failed.
1416780	1417900	Beck has pretty good grip.
1417900	1419740	In fact, it's one of his best skills
1419740	1421780	because it's related directly to your power
1421780	1422620	which is my highest.
1422620	1423460	Yeah, exactly.
1423460	1425940	I rolled a 76 on a 75.
1425940	1426980	Oh.
1426980	1428340	Oh, fuck, dude.
1428340	1429720	Damn.
1429720	1431500	Well, Cal is an old professional
1431500	1433740	and he rolled 39 on a 60.
1433740	1436780	Yeah, Julius got a 62 on a 60.
1436780	1438820	Beck, you shoot the news.
1438820	1440700	This is not, you're not a police officer.
1440700	1442460	This is not your job.
1442460	1443660	Why are you here?
1443660	1445100	She shouldn't have called you.
1445100	1446180	This was just a story.
1446180	1448940	He likes to film interviews and everything was fine
1448940	1450460	and oh fuck, there's a body.
1450460	1452880	That was not on the docket today.
1456420	1458860	You don't have to look at her.
1458860	1459980	Julius looks.
1459980	1460820	Cal looks.
1460820	1462300	Beck definitely looks.
1462620	1464340	You're all gonna have to roll grip again
1464340	1466540	as you see there's a streak of blood
1466540	1467860	on the floor of the apartment
1467860	1470540	where Kaylee Silver clearly dragged the body
1470540	1472620	to then put her on the couch.
1472620	1474300	You notice out of the corner of your eye,
1474300	1476500	Kaylee's wincing as you all look
1476500	1479700	and see the body of another 20 or 30 something
1479700	1484200	but this corpse has been almost completely decapitated
1484200	1486540	by something sharp enough to get the job done
1486540	1489380	but blunt enough that some of the cuts
1489380	1492180	look more like the skin was ripped apart.
1492820	1496100	As you approach, you notice between the shoulders
1496100	1498680	where this poor woman's neck and throat should be
1498680	1501500	with blood caked all around it,
1501500	1504660	you can see the top of her spinal cord
1504660	1507660	and you can see right down her trachea.
1509220	1511300	Did you pass that grip check?
1511300	1512780	I did.
1512780	1513780	39.
1513780	1515180	I got a 92.
1515180	1518940	Beck just needed to flip into oh shit, it's real mode.
1518940	1520540	Now he's there.
1520540	1521380	This isn't the first time
1521380	1523860	he's had to cover terrible things.
1523860	1525100	He's seen bodies before.
1525100	1526020	Sure, just not unexpectedly.
1526020	1527620	He just wasn't ready for it.
1527620	1529540	He thought he was, yeah, this was a fluff piece.
1529540	1532660	Same for Cal except he failed this role.
1532660	1536220	He thought he was prepared after seeing the legs.
1536220	1538160	He wasn't prepared for this.
1538160	1540300	He vomits quietly in the hallway.
1540300	1543460	I'm gonna need you both to roll a D4.
1544700	1545540	Two.
1545540	1546360	Two.
1546360	1547200	One.
1547200	1548300	You lose two grip, Julius,
1548300	1550500	and Cal, you lose one grip.
1551340	1554720	Cal is taken so far back, he is out in the hallway.
1554720	1556880	I said he vomited quietly.
1559820	1560660	Oh, sorry.
1564740	1566680	How are you dealing with this, Julius?
1566680	1570620	The legs made him very uncomfortable walking in
1570620	1572260	and seeing a little bit of it.
1572260	1576400	Even worse, he's just frozen there staring at it.
1576400	1579000	Like, can't look away.
1579000	1582000	I think that now that Beck passed,
1582000	1584180	he's a little more in the moment for a second,
1584180	1586480	and he's suddenly aware that he's standing in a room
1586480	1588920	with a dead body and a woman saying, I didn't do it,
1588920	1591360	which sometimes they did did it.
1591360	1593160	Yeah, sometimes they did his did.
1593160	1595160	The most likely person to have did it
1596160	1597560	is the alive person in the room.
1597560	1598720	He's putting a little bit of distance
1598720	1600640	between himself and Kaylee,
1600640	1602960	just in case she's maybe got a knife on her currently,
1602960	1603920	even still.
1603920	1607740	Everybody roll alertness.
1607740	1608580	Fail.
1609240	1610080	Pass.
1610080	1610920	I failed.
1610920	1614120	Julius, you see that there's a broken beer bottle
1614120	1615840	under the coffee table
1615840	1619940	that is absolutely dripping in blood.
1621840	1624160	And Kaylee walks over to the kitchen
1624160	1625840	and leans against the countertop
1626880	1629400	and just turns back to you and is like,
1629400	1632960	okay, I did it, but I had to do it.
1632960	1634440	I did it, but I had to do it.
1634440	1635360	You have to trust me.
1635360	1638400	Julius is immediately looking over at Beck like,
1638680	1641000	you've got to be getting this, right?
1641000	1642920	She's already been in a closeup zoom
1642920	1645280	to try and get micro expressions and everything.
1645280	1649040	And she just confessed on camera, but she doesn't care.
1649040	1650440	Killed them all, of course.
1652880	1654560	It was self-defense.
1654560	1657400	She was, I don't know how to say this,
1657400	1659560	but she was trying to tear me apart.
1662120	1663320	Why?
1663320	1664960	Get it together, Kaylee.
1664960	1667360	Kaylee is a young adult.
1667360	1669680	She's got dirty blonde space buns
1669680	1673760	and she's wearing a pink crop top with neon green ringers
1673760	1675720	on the sleeves and the collar.
1675720	1677480	It's one of those happy bunny shirts.
1677480	1679840	When you say space buns, do you mean Princess Leia buns?
1679840	1682680	Oh, I guess kind of, but just like buns
1682680	1685080	that are on the top of her head, like little buns.
1685080	1685920	What makes them space?
1685920	1687760	Was it Xenon of the 21st century?
1687760	1688720	Did she have those?
1689880	1694320	You said she's mid thirties, space buns, cool crop top.
1694320	1695160	Yeah.
1695160	1696240	What's her deal?
1696280	1697600	She just killed somebody.
1697600	1699280	Yeah, but in self-defense.
1699280	1701760	Yeah, it's like Xenon if those pigtails
1701760	1704320	were like all wrapped up in buns.
1704320	1706200	Oh yeah, I thought she had them.
1706200	1709080	It's one of those happy bunny shirts from like Hot Topic
1709080	1712400	and it says, it's not your fault, I'm blaming you anyway.
1712400	1713240	Nice.
1713240	1715280	She did it on purpose.
1715280	1716540	That's Thomas's take.
1718200	1719640	She said it was in self-defense.
1719640	1720840	I promise.
1720840	1722720	Cal has gathered himself a little bit
1722720	1725280	and he wants to, I guess,
1725280	1729140	humant that statement or what else would I look at?
1729140	1730360	I want sincerity in her voice
1730360	1732960	and then I'm also looking for signs of a physical struggle.
1732960	1735400	Humant for her, forensics for the scene,
1735400	1736640	if anybody wants to roll.
1736640	1738520	Oh, fucking three.
1738520	1739440	Nice. Nice.
1739440	1741240	She seems extremely genuine.
1741240	1743520	I did it, but I had to do, it was self-defense.
1743520	1745080	I fucking promise you.
1745080	1745920	Who is she?
1747640	1748560	Who is she?
1749800	1751120	She's my best friend.
1753120	1753960	Kaylee.
1753960	1755480	What's her deal?
1755480	1757400	I'm Kaylee, she's Kaylee.
1757400	1760080	It's spelled differently, but we're best friends.
1760080	1761320	We like bonded on that.
1763000	1764000	Is this what really,
1764000	1766240	because that's difficult podcasting.
1766240	1767080	Is it?
1767080	1768540	When we're talking about Kaylee at any moment,
1768540	1769760	it could be two different people.
1769760	1770760	One of them is dead.
1770760	1773760	Yeah, it also sounds like a great situation for farce.
1777920	1779240	Her name is Carolee.
1779240	1780560	I did what I did.
1781480	1782720	In the moment.
1782720	1784080	I think you're the one that expressed
1784080	1786720	that you regretted naming an NPC John
1786720	1789600	and a PC John in the first season.
1789600	1792400	Okay, but like, are we going to be talking to Kaylee
1792400	1794360	for another 40 episodes or just right now?
1794360	1795240	I think it's pretty fun.
1795240	1796800	Also, Luke had an elegant solution.
1796800	1797640	Carolee is her name.
1797640	1800160	Kaylee, K period Lee.
1800160	1802480	K dot Lee, Carole.
1802480	1804400	Carole is the daughter of Cal.
1804400	1806160	Yeah, that's her full name.
1806160	1808360	If we're going on those rules.
1808360	1810240	Yeah, her name is Kaylee.
1810240	1811600	Spelled how?
1811600	1814440	K-Y-L-E-I-G-H, Kaylee.
1814440	1815280	Oh no.
1816480	1817660	And her last name is?
1817660	1818500	Kaylee.
1818500	1820920	Yeah, I mean, it's gold.
1820920	1822440	Oh, Kaylee silver, Kaylee gold.
1822440	1825120	We're like, we're destined to be best friends.
1825120	1828440	And for the past, fuck, 12 years,
1828440	1830880	she's been my ride or die, you know?
1830880	1834320	And then she comes at me, her eyes went somewhere else.
1834320	1836720	She was just staring at my gut
1836720	1839280	and she was trying to tear me apart.
1839280	1842160	She was trying to tear me apart.
1842160	1845360	Sorry, shit, fuck, keep it down, Kaylee.
1845360	1848640	She was literally trying to get inside me.
1848640	1850160	How often was it brought up
1850160	1852360	that gold is better than silver?
1855360	1856600	She starts crying.
1858160	1860200	And Cal's like, was better than silver.
1865000	1867340	I look at back, I'm like, please say you got it,
1867340	1868840	please say you got it.
1869360	1870200	And she just nods.
1872200	1874040	Cal is kind of taking this all in
1874040	1876400	and there is usable footage,
1876400	1879460	but basically like this segment can't air as is, right?
1879460	1882120	We can't just throw this on the news.
1882120	1886180	Ms. Silver, if I could huddle with my crew for a moment,
1886180	1890960	we wanna discuss the best way to cover your incident here.
1890960	1893120	Yeah, no, of course I trust you.
1893120	1896720	Like I said to whoever I talked to on the phone,
1896720	1898860	I trust you, Cal.
1898860	1901360	I know that you believe in the truth
1901360	1903520	and I know that you are gonna find it, okay?
1904520	1905520	You have to.
1906760	1909060	That, like that stabs at Cal
1909060	1913480	and he lingers a moment on her gaze and nods.
1913480	1916080	A cat jumps up onto the countertop and she says,
1916080	1918480	oh, hey girl, hey girl.
1918480	1920320	That's Kaylee bronze.
1920320	1921160	It's girl.
1925080	1926280	I mean.
1926720	1928400	Either way, Cal is walking away from,
1928400	1929720	like he's huddling up.
1929720	1930560	Yeah, totally.
1930560	1932360	And Kaylee is just petting the cat
1932360	1933760	and trying to calm down.
1933760	1936480	And Julius is a camera off camera.
1936480	1937960	Against Beck's better judgment,
1937960	1939560	he doesn't ever like to turn the camera off
1939560	1942320	in a place like this, but he goes ahead and does it.
1942320	1944360	You've been in a place like this before?
1946360	1948640	Yeah, Cal kind of leads everybody out in the hallway.
1948640	1951720	The backs of your brains are fucking on fire.
1951720	1953300	None of you can think straight.
1953300	1955040	This is not your job.
1955040	1956360	This is not normal.
1956360	1958400	You are not having a normal day.
1958400	1961000	You have some serious decisions to make
1961000	1963880	that might have ramifications on the rest of your lives.
1963880	1965880	We have to call 911.
1965880	1968680	The police, my dudes, the police are needed here
1968680	1971320	and like fucking yesterday.
1971320	1973400	I'm glad to hear you both say that.
1973400	1976880	I don't think we can err until the police are notified.
1976880	1979800	We have to call them immediately.
1979800	1981520	I'm gonna put you on that, Jesse.
1982160	1983000	Pfft.
1986120	1986960	Which is what he says.
1986960	1987800	I'm looking around.
1989080	1989920	Fuck yes.
1991840	1993880	Beck and Julius are looking at each other.
1993880	1995400	I'm looking for Mr. Lemon.
1998200	2000520	But yeah, Julius is calling 911.
2000520	2002080	911, what's your emergency?
2002080	2003600	There's been a...
2003600	2005400	Wait, hold on, let me take that again.
2005400	2008240	911, what's your emergency?
2008240	2010400	Now, why is everybody in the city caging?
2012480	2016320	911, what's your emergency?
2016320	2017160	Okay, let me try again.
2017160	2020360	It is city funeral tradition to have a crawfish oil.
2020360	2021520	Yeah, that's true.
2023160	2024800	Yeah, but that was like Mardi Gras in St. Louis.
2024800	2027160	Like, I don't talk like that.
2030680	2032800	911, what's your emergency?
2032800	2033640	911.
2038200	2039040	The Calvin story.
2042520	2044880	On the 911 plan.
2046600	2048800	911, what's your emergency?
2048800	2050720	I need to report a murder.
2050720	2052920	Oh, what?
2052920	2053760	Holy shit!
2055920	2058640	Literally, she's like, oh, okay.
2058640	2059640	What's your address?
2059640	2061960	I tell her the address that is on that piece of paper.
2061960	2062800	Yep.
2062800	2063640	Oh, that's downtown.
2063640	2064920	Is that an apartment building?
2064920	2068840	Yes, it's on the eighth floor, 836.
2068880	2072400	I didn't do it, but I know who might have.
2072400	2073240	Cal's like.
2073240	2076120	And they left.
2076120	2078080	They're gone, long gone.
2078080	2080320	Julius is obviously not reading the signals
2080320	2082280	from his partner as well at all.
2082280	2084960	And he's like, nevermind, they're in the apartment.
2084960	2086720	Cal is fierce.
2086720	2088120	What are you, no.
2088120	2089600	Hold on, hold on.
2089600	2092080	This is someone who knows more.
2092080	2095000	Hello, Cal, Colorado, City Action News.
2095000	2095920	Oh, hi.
2095960	2098840	They're, wow.
2098840	2100680	May I ask who I'm speaking to?
2100680	2105680	Yeah, my name's Jennifer, and I am speechless,
2106960	2109920	but I need information as soon as possible.
2109920	2110760	Well, Jennifer.
2110760	2111960	And I'm talking to the right guy.
2111960	2113000	I'm having a hell of a day.
2113000	2114520	How's yours going?
2114520	2117880	I, it was fine until now, I suppose.
2117880	2120560	Tell me more about this homicide.
2120560	2124200	Well, we were called to investigate a news story.
2124200	2125760	You know, that's what I do.
2126640	2128200	I do know that's what you do.
2128200	2129440	With those, nope.
2129440	2130800	It's fine, it's fine.
2130800	2133080	With those piercing blue eyes of yours.
2133080	2133920	I know.
2134960	2137800	No, Jennifer, when we got down here, oh, I got Southern.
2138920	2141200	I'm Southern, I see it, rubs off on people.
2141200	2142680	Sorry, I thought I left this accent
2142680	2144000	when I got to the city, but.
2144000	2147400	Oh, no, it comes back so quick, don't it?
2147400	2152000	There is a terribly mutilated body in this apartment.
2152000	2155200	Now, the young woman here says she did it,
2155520	2158520	but she says it was in self-defense, an act of necessity.
2158520	2162040	The violence visited upon this corpse might belie that fact,
2162040	2164240	but we are not the police.
2164240	2166840	That's why we need you here to look at this.
2167880	2170400	I think I'm going to Obama.
2170400	2173000	Well, yeah, I mean, take this as high as you can.
2173000	2173840	Take this as high as you can.
2173840	2174660	Take this as high as you can.
2174660	2175500	Take this as high as you can.
2175500	2176320	Take this as high as you can.
2176320	2177160	Take this as high as you can.
2177160	2178000	Take this as high as you can.
2178000	2179240	Do you know Obama?
2180560	2182400	Roll the tape, you know Obama.
2182400	2183480	Well, I don't want to brag,
2183520	2185880	but I did interview him when he campaigned in the city.
2185880	2188000	There is a picture of you and him hanging in your hallway.
2188000	2189880	Yeah, one of the many pictures in the hallway
2189880	2190840	is of Cal and Obama.
2190840	2193000	It's not as big as the one that's Cal and Michelle.
2193000	2193840	Sir.
2194720	2197520	Okay, so I need you to stay on the line with me.
2197520	2198960	Officers are on their way
2198960	2201760	and they will be there very shortly.
2201760	2202920	Was there a murder weapon?
2202920	2207920	There appears to be, again, we're not investigators.
2208400	2209960	We are journalists.
2209960	2212240	We listen to the people who have found the facts
2212240	2214240	and we try to report them as best we can.
2214240	2217440	Now, is there a horribly bloody
2217440	2219200	broken beer bottle on the floor?
2219200	2220800	Yes.
2220800	2225360	Is that the device that ripped this woman's neck apart?
2225360	2226680	I could not say.
2226680	2228320	Wow, okay, thank you.
2228320	2231480	Have you talked to the woman who said that she did it?
2231480	2232940	Has she told you anything more
2232940	2234720	than just the fact that she did it?
2234720	2236360	Well, she told us she did it
2236360	2238360	and we immediately called you.
2238360	2240960	Well, that was a very smart decision.
2240960	2243080	We felt that literally anything else
2243080	2245200	would be incredibly incriminating
2245200	2247240	and it might implicate us in her crime.
2247240	2250760	I'm very glad that you are not gonna go to prison, yes.
2250760	2251760	Well, me too.
2251760	2254280	That would have been not as fun to role-play,
2254280	2255120	I don't think.
2257080	2259160	I'm sure we could have come up with something.
2259160	2264080	And role-playing prison would be another cool thing.
2264080	2264920	You're right.
2264920	2266880	Cal Colorado in prison.
2266880	2267720	Holy shit.
2267720	2268960	It might have to happen.
2268960	2272680	All right, I have word that officers
2272680	2276320	are on their way up the elevator to your location right now.
2276320	2279080	And down the hallway, you hear the elevator.
2282360	2286000	B-roll of cops pouring out of the elevator.
2286000	2286840	Ding.
2286840	2287680	Bex on it.
2287680	2290560	Like smoke billowing from a chimney.
2291440	2294920	These cops bumble out of this fucking elevator.
2294920	2296680	Don't remind me of my.
2299960	2302000	All right, it's clearly the premium team.
2311520	2313280	And they approach you.
2313280	2315600	It's two officers and.
2315600	2317680	Two officers come pouring out of the elevator.
2317680	2318520	Oh, sorry.
2319720	2320840	It's six officers.
2320840	2322320	After they get close enough
2322320	2323760	that I've got a good shot of them,
2323760	2325840	I wanna kinda put the camera down tiny bit
2325840	2327880	and I wanna talk to them before they talk to us
2327880	2328720	and I'm just gonna say,
2329440	2332440	officers, she's not violent currently
2332440	2336000	and she kinda has a rapport with Cal here.
2336000	2338600	You might let him ease you guys in there.
2338600	2340040	Ooh, role persuade.
2343200	2344800	Fuck.
2344800	2347040	It's a 60 on a 50.
2347040	2348920	I'm gonna go ahead and use my luck.
2348920	2349760	Ooh.
2349760	2351960	Cause I wanna film Cal talking to her more.
2351960	2352800	Awesome.
2352800	2354640	Six, that's a good one.
2354640	2357840	The first officer, you can tell by the look on his face
2357880	2360080	that he's about to talk down to you
2360080	2361480	and as he goes to talk,
2363920	2365320	he's got a frog in his throat
2365320	2367760	and one of the officers behind him says,
2367760	2369760	yeah, I think that's probably a good idea.
2369760	2372200	Cal, dude, she trusts you
2372200	2374960	and like, I think at the end of the day,
2374960	2377680	turning herself into the police is the right idea.
2377680	2379000	I just think you need to make sure
2379000	2380880	that she's convinced of that
2380880	2383280	and maybe get to the bottom of why she did this
2383280	2386280	and he's kinda winking so the cops can't see.
2386320	2387800	You know, ask her some questions
2387800	2390920	about what put her in a state of mind to do this
2390920	2393000	and maybe get more about like what was happening
2393000	2396040	right before they did this.
2396040	2398800	And try to do a dance with her if you can.
2398800	2399640	Hahaha.
2404920	2408120	Cal has been like nodding, preparing his interview.
2408120	2408960	Yeah.
2408960	2410720	And then he hears that last part.
2410720	2411560	Hahaha.
2413080	2416040	And he kinda like, I will do what I can.
2416040	2418000	Julius gets his phone out just in case.
2418000	2418840	Hahaha.
2420440	2422520	Yeah, Beck is definitely pulling up the camera
2422520	2425120	and gonna just follow him into the room.
2425120	2427520	As you go back in, you see Kaylee is at the kitchen island.
2427520	2430880	She's hunched over and looking at her phone
2430880	2435880	and she has wide eyes that cannot look away.
2437040	2440500	And she's just staring at the screen.
2440500	2443580	Cal kinda waves his hand in front of her eyes
2443580	2445580	and like snaps.
2447040	2447880	Kaylee?
2448880	2450000	Miss Silver.
2450000	2450840	I have a furbo.
2452220	2453060	I'm sorry, what?
2453060	2456560	Ger, when I am out at work, I have a furbo.
2456560	2459200	It records motion.
2459200	2460480	Cal, she's got a camera.
2460480	2462840	My producer is telling me that's some kind of camera.
2462840	2465000	She holds the phone up to you
2465000	2469620	and you're looking at footage from inside this apartment.
2469620	2472840	You see Kaylee gold before she became the corpse
2472840	2475000	laid out on the couch.
2475000	2478560	In this grainy video, she's sitting on that same couch,
2478560	2481360	petting Ger, shooting the shit.
2481360	2484380	In the kitchen, you see Kaylee Silver
2484380	2486680	before she killed her friend.
2486680	2488380	She walks through the background
2488380	2490720	and grabs a beer from the fridge.
2490720	2494080	There's no label on the bottle, all is well.
2494080	2495800	Kaylee gold is laughing.
2495800	2499480	Kaylee Silver cracks her beer open, all is well.
2499480	2502440	Kaylee gold begins telling a story.
2502920	2505080	Kaylee Silver takes a swig.
2505080	2506780	Something changes.
2506780	2510380	Kaylee gold's neck snaps like she's a dog
2510380	2512780	and Kaylee Silver's a squirrel.
2512780	2514520	Gold's posture gets weird.
2514520	2518380	She lunges, reaching out for Silver's stomach
2518380	2521200	just under the neon crop top.
2521200	2523060	I need you guys to roll grip.
2524960	2526560	Pass with an 18.
2526560	2527600	I pass with a five.
2527600	2529400	I pass with a 26.
2529400	2531340	We're still at Missleman.
2531340	2533700	Kaylee Silver cries out.
2533700	2537800	You can see the fear and panic and confusion in her eyes,
2537800	2540940	both on this Furbo footage on her trembling phone
2540940	2543580	as well as on her trembling face.
2543580	2546620	In the video, she shoves her berserk bestie backward
2546620	2550440	out of frame, but when Kaylee gold comes back into view,
2550440	2554060	she's propelled herself horizontally through the air
2554060	2556180	and she spears Kaylee Silver
2556180	2559020	into and over the kitchen counter,
2559020	2561820	out of the Furbo camera's view.
2561820	2565900	You hear screams of anguish and glee
2565900	2567540	and you hear a glass bottle break
2567540	2569840	and a splash of beer hits the fridge.
2570860	2575020	But then you just hear a percussive and visceral
2575020	2580020	scrunch, scrunch, scrunch, scrunch, scrunch, scrunch.
2584160	2585620	Then silence.
2586620	2589220	Then a heartbreaking wail.
2590300	2593860	Kaylee Silver stands here, phone out, frozen,
2593860	2597500	tears filling up as much of the eyes as possible
2597500	2600340	without yet spilling down her face.
2600340	2602860	Kaylee, I'm glad you called us.
2602860	2605380	I'm glad you could trust me.
2605380	2609220	You're gonna have to go with the police now.
2609220	2611980	Can you send me that footage before you go?
2611980	2613580	Cal like glares at you
2613580	2616300	but doesn't necessarily say anything to stop that.
2616300	2617740	She hands you the phone.
2617740	2619060	I email it to myself.
2619060	2621260	Beck is just gonna kinda chime in.
2621260	2622580	He doesn't normally do this.
2622580	2624740	From behind the camera, he's a silent viewer,
2624740	2628940	but he's now seen that she's 100% been truthful with us.
2628940	2631340	You've got the proof right here, you're gonna be fine.
2631340	2632860	She attacked you.
2632860	2634580	Just as a little comforting word.
2634580	2636300	She's looking at the door
2636300	2639780	and she can sense the cops on the other side of it.
2639780	2641100	I don't think we closed the door.
2641100	2643980	Oh, okay, then she can see the six cops
2643980	2646660	just kinda like peering in, staring.
2646660	2649340	One of them's got handcuffs in their hands ready to go.
2649340	2651660	I load up the video that I just sent myself
2651660	2654300	and like go to show it to one of the cops.
2654300	2657260	As you do so, the other one walks in.
2657260	2660900	Ma'am, you have the right to remain silent.
2660900	2663140	Everything you say can and will be held against you
2663140	2664140	in a court of law.
2664140	2667380	As he's like Miranda-ing her, Cal is saying,
2667420	2671020	Kaylee, the video shows you acted in self-defense.
2671020	2673780	Just tell them the truth, everything will be fine.
2673780	2674980	It wasn't normal.
2674980	2675820	It wasn't.
2675820	2677340	What the fuck was it?
2677340	2678620	They'll find out.
2678620	2681100	Or will find out, please.
2681100	2683540	And she is walked out the door
2683540	2685820	and one of the other cops is like,
2685820	2689100	all right, camera boys, get on out of here.
2689100	2691180	Can't have you in an active crime scene.
2691180	2694100	Can I try and use my 30% stealth
2694100	2697060	to have kind of inched my way further back
2697660	2699980	into the apartment to maybe get some wider angles
2699980	2701020	of everything in the room?
2701020	2702620	I think you can do that for sure.
2705300	2706140	One.
2706140	2707580	Yeah, dude, are you serious?
2707580	2708860	I rolled a one.
2708860	2713180	Oh my God, that's amazing.
2713180	2714940	I don't know if this is the best roll to have that on,
2714940	2715780	but it's fun.
2715780	2717460	You can get any shot.
2717460	2719580	As you're getting a roll around the apartment,
2719580	2723980	you see that Kaylee Silver is an avid home brewer.
2723980	2724900	She made the beer.
2724900	2725940	She made the beer.
2725980	2727660	Oh, that's dope.
2727660	2729020	That is super dope.
2729940	2730780	Which one?
2730780	2731620	Silver is the brewer?
2731620	2733460	Silver is the brewer, Silver's apartment.
2733460	2734700	Gold is the friend.
2734700	2736820	As soon as Silver drank the beer,
2736820	2739140	Gold's neck snapped to attention.
2739140	2739980	Fuck yeah, dude.
2739980	2740820	Thank you for that.
2740820	2743420	That's a good nugget on a crit.
2744380	2745260	That is a good nugget.
2745260	2746580	Also the kind of shit we would have spent
2746580	2748460	like five episodes not finding out.
2750300	2752700	And Zach would be like, why don't you solve my mystery?
2753980	2755860	Perfect, perfect impression.
2756940	2759220	I want to get pregnant with you.
2759220	2763180	Don't do my normal voice on the show, dude.
2763180	2765820	I've been working really hard on the podcast voice.
2767020	2769100	I want to have a baby, Thomas.
2769100	2770460	I want to have a baby with you.
2774060	2777860	Julius texts his uncle, just like two thumbs up.
2777860	2778740	We've got gold.
2781020	2781860	Fuck.
2786820	2790340	Hey Joe, should you be like a sleazy news producer?
2793060	2794860	Cal looks blank.
2794860	2797740	And he's kind of like looking around the apartment
2797740	2799140	and just shaking his head.
2799140	2800780	And he starts to walk out
2800780	2803420	and he puts his arms around both of you.
2803420	2806860	Boys, I haven't had a drink in 25 years.
2806860	2808660	As the elevator doors are about to close,
2808660	2812260	you hear Kaylee Silver holler out through the hallway.
2812260	2813620	Help me, Colorado.
2814620	2815780	You're my only hope.
2816780	2819460	You see Cal's throat like completely close up at that.
2819460	2820500	And he gulps.
2821380	2824420	I'm taking you boys to the foundry.
2840220	2842940	Ramona is scanning face to face to face
2842980	2844580	around the table.
2844580	2846220	What are you guys doing right now?
2847100	2848220	She licked me.
2848220	2849420	With that penis tongue?
2850740	2853020	She was like, so did you zoom in on it?
2853020	2854580	Oh my God.
2854580	2855620	Had you?
2855620	2856660	No.
2856660	2857940	Did you then?
2857940	2859580	No.
2859580	2861100	Will you in the future?
2861100	2861940	For you?
2861940	2862780	Yeah.
2862780	2863620	No, not for me.
2863620	2864860	Jesus fucking Christ.
2864860	2866140	I don't want to look at it.
2866140	2867500	No, please don't.
2867500	2869900	I was never into like looking at any of those,
2869900	2873540	like, oh, two girls, one cup, a donkey man.
2873540	2874820	Like I didn't watch any of that shit.
2874820	2875660	Luke does.
2875660	2876500	Donkey man.
2877580	2878500	Oh my God.
2878500	2880100	It does look like a tongue.
2881260	2882100	You're right.
2882100	2882940	I'm bummed out.
2882940	2883780	I know.
2889420	2890260	Well.
2890260	2892140	I say again, can we restart season two?
2899900	2903580	Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.
2914100	2917700	Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.
2929900	2931220	I'm bummed out.
