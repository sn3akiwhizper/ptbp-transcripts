0	4680	Greetings my baby chickens. It's your mother hen wolf the dog
5080	12120	And I'm here to nest upon all of the eggs of contention hatching them into my own personal chicken army
12120	14280	I'm clucking at you live from
15280	19600	694.2 PTBP as always my chickadees
20200	28000	Real quick before we get up and started the boys from pretended to be people wanted me to let you know they are accepting
28320	30320	Questions for a third Q&A
30920	38840	Episode so if you have questions for any of the monsters that make that show tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram
39680	46960	There will also be a post in the subreddit where you can comment your questions or post them on our Facebook page
47520	52920	Fuck you mark fucker burg or email them to pretending pod at gmail.com
53480	60140	Or and seriously y'all should go do this go all out record audio of you asking your questions
60520	66320	And send that so they can use it in the episode much like the second Q&A episode
66320	73920	This one will be for our honorary police officers over on patreon who keep this show alive five bucks a month at a time
74680	78160	Speaking of things my producer forces me to read each week
78200	80440	We got a new howling at wolf for y'all
80880	88060	This week's is from at mad under dash seed who tweeted about the show and tagged at pretending pod
88120	95060	It reads as follows if you're not sure what kind of officer you're dealing with from contention PD
95160	101340	Just check the fit of the pants and listen to pretending to be people for one of the best actual play
101540	107420	Podcast out there love the podcast and wish there was a higher donor tear smiles
108020	112300	Madeline man, I miss seeing those officers in the future
112300	119020	You would think an entity could never truly miss a despicable being such as Keith Vigna and you'd be right
119140	120620	Don't worry Madeline
120620	126980	There may be more questionable content for you to throw even more of your hard-earned money at in the future
127700	133700	Sometimes when looking forward it is important to glance behind and remind your mind that
133980	137860	Mankind is designed inclined and resigned to die
138420	140220	It's time for the news
140220	142900	Last time Ken Krenkelhoff Liz
143180	148180	Longlin and Jeremy Pettymore came across a large frame hanging in the woods
148540	156060	Can realized an old memory was closer to reality than he had hoped but he was able to disable a trap that otherwise
156340	164260	would have put a giant wooden spear through someone's mouth and out the back of the head through the broken canvas in the frame the
164260	167020	three see a cabin in the woods Ken
167620	169620	susceptible to being scared of cliches
169940	176200	Freaked out grabbed the spear and charged toward the cabin and then he disappeared into a pile of leaves
176780	180420	Ash hornbeam was down on hope and hit points
180420	185500	But a man in a black suit with a bolo tie came out of nowhere to interrogate him
185740	193120	After agent Kevin got the information ash had to think quickly in order to not become just another missing person in the woods
193780	200220	Thankfully his quick wit and false reputation was enough to convince agent Kevin to spare him for now
200660	204040	Now this next sentence may sound a bit kooky
204040	212100	But agent Kevin came back with a woman named agent Karen who chanted over a machete and then in one swift motion
212460	215580	Took off ashes arm in the middle of his forearm
216540	221340	Stranger still the wound immediately cauterized and flesh grew to form a nub
221620	228080	They took ash to a black car hidden in thick brush where they are set up to stake out a cabin in the woods
229200	233420	Sharon shadow Berryman somewhere between unaware and
233780	241500	Purposefully oblivious followed Krista Kringlehoff off the path into the darkness and directly into a skip bow trap
241580	247580	Right around the ankle it then became clear that perhaps Krista Kringlehoff isn't quite herself
248420	252740	Judy Kringlehoff having seen the body of the state ranger ed buzz
253100	258320	Woodrow all spineless and shit walked back out into the darkness the rain
258620	264020	The parking lot of the contention woods and then she made a terrible decision
264020	270020	Taking us from here in the warm glow and comfort of Wolf's secret hideout
270020	275020	That is definitely not a trash can to that moment in the shivering wet
275340	280940	Darkness lit only by strikes of lightning in the distance. It's blue false
281420	283420	indigo with
294020	296020	Oh
320940	322940	Time has come
324020	326020	to
326660	332900	Dance beneath a dance beneath the shadow of the moon
354060	360180	a lightning bolt flashes in the distance and it's just enough to light up a
361500	363300	blood-covered
363300	365300	Krista Kringlehoff
366100	368100	Who is walking?
369740	371740	Directly toward you
372580	374580	The raccoon at your side
376180	379420	Shivers something fierce and is like
379420	381420	Right
382420	389580	Tugs at your arm and then just fucking takes off running backwards like back towards no like crab walking. Yeah. No it runs
391140	397060	Like into the parking lot trying to get to the street, okay, but not running back towards the shack hell no
397060	402140	Okay, running as far away from these woods here as possible. Okay, I don't follow him
402140	404700	I state I stay there cuz I'm first of all
405100	410380	Freaking out from the body and I am not sure what to think of my mom. So I I stand there Judy
411460	412940	Judy Judy
412940	416980	That girl that girl that you were with is she is no good
417220	420260	She was not trying to help look for Liz at all
420260	425940	in fact, she she told me she told me that she wanted to just run back to the woods with her and
426620	428620	And and told me to come back out here
434700	436700	I'm so scared for you
436740	442540	Maybe we should go back up to the shack and I'll see if I can find some band-aids in your purse to help fix
442540	449020	You up that is an excellent idea. Thank you so much. Okay, so I guide her back up to the shack
449020	453800	I'm like holding on to her and helping her walk and then as soon as we get to the shack
453800	457460	I want to get her in the shack and close the door you do so
457460	463260	Okay, and then I can't find a lock or anything. So at this point I just close the door and I'm just holding it
463400	469180	Okay, well my mother is inside. Yeah, absolutely and as you're holding the door. Oh
472660	474660	Shit
474740	479020	You feel a pinch on the back of your neck and
480340	484860	when you turn around you see that your
485380	489860	mom's body has crumpled to the ground and
490620	498740	Standing in front of you its metallic arms shoved into the ground and the ceiling and the walls of the shack in
498900	504460	The middle of which is a small one inch in diameter metal sphere
504980	507740	One of these tendrils reaches around
508340	513140	with another tendril it snaps Judy Krenkelhoff's neck forward and
513780	515780	rips out her spine
516300	517980	shoving itself
517980	521700	Into the spinal column and filling it and
522500	527300	You Allie are now playing this entity
531020	537260	Okay in which you remember all of these strange memories
537780	541980	All of these details, but you are an objective based
542540	546100	Entity and your objective is to collect as many
546860	548860	Bodies as possible
549020	556860	So your goal Allie is to get one-on-one with one of the other players and pass off this entity
557060	563500	That way it can collect more bodies. Okay, and you will also know what has recently happened
563500	567500	So, you know that you came to the woods as Judy Krenkelhoff
567940	574980	With shadow and Liz and you know that you were out there to do a spell or a ritual
574980	581300	But that is all the information from Judy Krenkelhoff that you know, everything else will just have to be
582180	584180	hog shit and horse lies
588540	590540	Makes improv easier. I
591660	597520	Told my parents about this podcast. My dad was like, so you just lie quick
598780	601300	It's like yep. He's like you're gonna be good at that
604980	606980	Life
622980	627980	Do we know any of the other words to that song cuz I don't yeah, I think it's a lot of bad
627980	631180	I think it's a lot of bus. What if it was just that the whole time?
631820	633260	Alright, Joe
633260	637060	You're sliding on your back and you can feel the
637580	642380	Mud and sludge is making this slide a bit more
643060	650300	Liquid and thick viscous. However still enough to slide you down and you are sliding for some time
650940	652940	before you land
653580	659300	Eventually in a pit of dirt and pitch blackness. Can I get a sense of how much lateral movement I had
659300	665780	So much lateral movement, so I'm like underground yeah, you might think that with all that lateral movement you've slid
666620	668620	underneath this cabin
669580	677380	That far perfect fuck you are on your back scared out of your gourd because it's spooky time. Everything's a
679500	682280	And you you're scared out of your coconut this Halloween
683280	685280	Oh
686280	689680	Patreon listeners will remember our episode in Hawaii
691520	698440	Coconuts were the gourds of that game. All right, so you feel dirt and rock
698760	706120	Underneath your hands. I want to try and stand up. Can I almost all the way before your head hits a piece of wood? Oh
706880	712080	Shit, it's wood. Can I look up back? What if I had said stone? I know I wasn't sure
713280	717560	Can I look back up the slide? I just came down. Can I see any daylight or I mean moonlight?
717560	723440	There's no daylight or moonlight coming down from where you came from. You know, it kind of would have been cool
723440	725440	If it had been daylight
727800	731040	You can tell it's the Sun making this light it's a different color
731520	736840	Is there any light in this area that I know you are in perfect Vin Diesel darkness?
736840	738840	Did I hang on to my spear on my way through? Oh
739680	741680	Go ahead and roll
741880	743080	dexterity
743080	744760	Okay
744760	748000	Can crinkle Hoff so good at sport? I'm a sport sports boy
748600	750040	32 on a
750040	754760	75 so good at holding on to his giant spear and it is
755960	762800	Horizontal with where you are. It would not be able to stand up as you remember it being longer than you
762800	766080	Can I okay, you know how long you are as a human?
766080	768080	If
768360	773620	I look up I've deduced that I'm maybe under the cabin. Is it floorboards above me?
773620	779120	Is it maybe slats of wood? It's not no because there's no light coming down this I said it was yeah
779200	782520	So therefore there's no slats of wood of you
782520	789540	Can I want to just lightly push and see if it maybe is hopefully a door that I'm under you do not seem to be
789540	791160	under a door
791160	794640	Do you have anything on you that could make a light of any kind
794880	799520	Yeah, he doesn't have a lighter because he's such a good boy. I mean I was out camping
799520	803840	Maybe I have a flashlight on me. Is there a role to determine if I had a flashlight on me? Yeah, absolutely
804520	810460	Let's just roll an up and down 50% look if you roll under you succeed if you roll over you fail
812280	816280	They're rolled over oh, but it's a 69 our house rule makes that a
816280	818280	You
820480	825600	Have whatever light source you want one of those ones that lights it up like daylight
827000	829380	It'll burn the wood. It's so bright. I
830920	834040	Just got a nice big mag light. Yeah, you absolutely do
834040	839040	I flipped that bad boy on when you flip it on you see that you are in the crawl space
839640	843740	But this doesn't seem like a place that is often used
844420	848660	However, you do see what looks like maybe floor supports
849060	854500	However, they are tube like in nature and as you flash the flashlight
855020	858360	Over them you see that they are
858980	862220	translucent tubes that are filled
862900	869300	With this squeamish black ooze that seems to be traveling downward
869980	872600	from above into the ground below
874300	877100	My god Zach, you're the coolest
881820	886740	You also see on the far side away from you there's a door that leads up
886740	892060	I mean, I think Ken would for sure maybe try back the slidey way
892060	896680	Can he get any purchase to get back up the slide that he came down? Oh interesting
896680	900100	I don't think he would want to be going into the house if he could help it. Yeah, that makes sense
900820	903300	Go ahead and give it a go with an
903980	908700	Athletics check are you bringing the spear or no? Yeah, that's not gonna leave my side
908700	912620	Okay, if at all possible go ahead and take a negative 20 on the athletics check
915460	917180	And it's a fail
917180	924420	70 on what would be a 30 you continue to try and try but there's so much
924460	930500	Sludge in this area that it's like the Japanese game show slippery stairs. That's what I was picturing and
931340	934240	You're not green. Dang. Yeah should have bet on blue
936480	938480	Okay, then I am going to
939020	940540	cautiously approach the
940540	945420	Cautiously approach the door and I want to put my ear to it. Do I hear any sounds on the other side?
945420	947420	We'll find out after we
954420	956420	You
969020	970180	Luke
970180	977840	Ashhorn beam walks to this black sedan and this four-wheeler that are out in the middle of these woods in this thick of brush
977840	979840	of trees and
980380	983160	Agent Kevin looks at you. All right
983960	987640	Get on get on in we're staking up this this cabin
987640	993200	I'll tell you more and and he opens up the back door for you ash kind of hesitantly
994500	1001400	He looks at the FBI agents and for one moment he thinks about just taking off
1001560	1006340	It's raining. It's dark, but he doesn't it takes him about three seconds
1006340	1013220	Which seems like five minutes and he hops into the back of the car and when you hop into the back of this black
1013220	1019580	Sedan sitting in the back seat on the other side is a man who is quite tall
1019780	1024300	it's wearing the same black suit white shirt black tie and
1025060	1030420	he's blonde but his hair is like buzzed and he's in his early 30s and
1031420	1036980	He looks at you and immediately flashes you a FBI badge and it's like agent Kyle
1037100	1040460	Nice to meet you ash looks over at him doesn't say anything
1040980	1045980	Buckles his seat belt and looks straight at the ground or the floor of the car
1045980	1052780	I suppose agent Karen gets in the shotgun seat and agent Kevin gets in the driver's seat and
1053400	1059280	Looking at the floorboards you see that there's a bunch of electrical spool wiring
1059480	1066440	Yeah, we got some we got some pretty cool explosives in the back man. Yeah, I'm gonna blow this thing the fuck up, right?
1069720	1071000	I'm sorry
1071000	1074720	It's gonna be tight man. Ash is super cool. Ash looks at him and
1075280	1077280	He's immediately intrigued
1077480	1084600	he starts looking at the spool on the floorboard and he's immediately reminded of
1085080	1088240	The time that him and his father set up
1089080	1092240	fireworks display for the town for contention and
1094000	1101560	Ash gets super excited. He looks at the FBI agent opens up his jacket a little bit to reveal
1102200	1106520	what I called water dynamite sure and then I
1107080	1115000	show him the other side of my jacket, which is two sticks of actual dynamite and I
1115880	1117880	wink and finger gun
1118280	1124360	Well young sir, that's dino might and hopefully we don't die tonight. I
1125480	1129520	Look back at the floor and I just kind of pick up the piece of the wire
1129800	1137380	Like look at him and look at the wire. It's like just smile. What's your name young sir? Um, my name's ash hornbeam
1139000	1141000	And you've always sounded like that
1141000	1143000	So
1146440	1153840	As you guys ash hornbeam that's that's more like it my name's I ash hornbeam my name's ash hornbeam I
1154680	1156680	think I kind of
1157600	1162480	Really steered into this is the way names of that thick southern Malayas
1162480	1165080	I was trying to do a port of relaxing
1165280	1172000	As you're looking out ahead of you you see this cabin that's sitting out in this small clearing and
1172240	1178360	Outside the cabin you see that there is sack is scrolling on his computer
1179000	1181000	I'm I'm
1181040	1186960	Intrigued and worried there seems to be some sort of outdoor building almost like a pod, you know
1186960	1190120	Like a storage locker kind of unit thing. Yeah
1190120	1197320	There's one of those and there's also a big yellow excavator sitting outside and you had our pillar
1197440	1199440	yeah, exactly and
1199440	1206320	You would also notice that there is a moat that surrounds this cabin
1206360	1211240	You can't tell how wide it is or how deep it is because you're still pretty far away
1211240	1216800	But you can see glinting off the surface of this water is the moonlight and that's how you kind of catch that
1216800	1221040	There's water there and then you see to the left of the cabin
1222280	1227920	movement outside the moat or yes, yeah about 25 yards out and
1228560	1232480	You see Liz lonklin is with your two friends
1233000	1237040	Jeremy Pettymore and Ken Krenkelhoff and they are like
1237520	1244880	Walking around this kind of thing and then they all stop and they're talking to each other and then Ken picks up this small log
1244880	1251080	And throws it on the ground and you see this wooden spear seven feet long
1251240	1255100	Just like flies in their direction and then hits a tree
1255680	1256520	immediately
1256520	1257320	Ken
1257320	1264640	Crabs this giant wooden spear out of the tree and takes off running and as he takes off running
1264880	1270720	Towards the cabin still like 20 yards away from the moat at this point. He just disappears
1270720	1278820	He like falls into the ground running away or towards and he falls into the ground and is completely out of sight
1285000	1288000	Dude I'm trying to describe my
1288720	1294180	What I looked like just then just I could not Luke look like a possum in headlights
1295100	1298700	Deer in the headlights, but or just a possum a possum in a flashlight
1298940	1304860	Kevin looks in the rearview mirror and he's like, oh, do you uh, do you know them and he looks back and he's like
1304860	1310820	We were looking around this place is just chock full of traps. Well, what is this place?
1310820	1316900	You know that mad you were talking about? Yeah, I don't know if that's her name or if that's her name now, but
1318180	1319860	Is she?
1319860	1323740	She's real. Oh, she's real. I always kind of thought
1324260	1327940	Kind of just a reason to get us out here, but overall sanity for me
1330900	1333060	The 99 is good, right? Oh
1335500	1340100	Yes, yes it is Luke it is very good what does that mean
1340100	1345860	Well, it means you take max damage, which was gonna be a d4 plus one. So you lose five sanity
1345860	1350300	I don't get to roll my d4. No, you do not you automatically take maximum
1351180	1355720	Sanity hit. So what was your sanity at? I was at I think 38. Let me see
1356300	1361940	37 so I'm down to 32 32 and also we're doing bouts of insanity
1362340	1363820	For this game here
1363820	1368740	And so when you lose five or more sanity in a single loss
1369020	1376020	My breaking point is also 32. Well, then that happens to work out fucking perfectly because you're gonna lose your shit. So
1376540	1378540	You remember in the old?
1378700	1383220	Campaigns we ran when you lost five or more sanity. We did fight flight or faint, right?
1383220	1387140	So did we do that on the podcast or was that not yet? Oh, man
1387140	1387420	All right
1387420	1394140	So Luke basically you're given the option fight flight or faint you need to rank them and most likely to least likely
1394380	1398660	Her ashes reaction for ash fight is number one. Sure
1400140	1403340	Faint is number two flight is the last one
1403340	1407460	He doesn't run away from anything unless he has to if you roll one two or three
1407500	1412980	You're gonna fight if you roll a four or five you're gonna faint and if you roll a six you're gonna flight
1412980	1415340	Am I rolling a d6 d6 for me?
1415340	1420820	This is the first time I've used the d6 that Joe gave us. Oh nice and heavy
1420820	1426020	When did Joe give us these he gave you and I those for Thomas's birthday
1426580	1429180	Which is that is listener
1430340	1436300	very indicative of Joe Terry is to give lots of people gifts for
1436500	1444180	Someone's birthday. He's the nicest person. He just knows that you and I are those kids like the kids birthday party
1444180	1450340	Why did he get presents? I want something too. If Thomas gets a treat
1450340	1456020	I want it too. I just had terribly vivid memories of La Croix boy. Oh
1456660	1458660	Jesus we did
1458860	1460860	We had fun
1461340	1463340	Roll that d6 formula
1464340	1469980	What do you think I got I think you got a six I got a six on your slump the slump in your shoulders
1469980	1475220	Yeah, I got a six. So I think that's a flight. That is a flight. Damn it
1475900	1481480	That works out really well for me personally. I'm sure I'd leave the room. Yeah, get the fuck out of here. Okay. Bye. Bye
1493340	1495340	You
1497140	1502300	Thomas Lindsay who what that's fair Jeremy Pettymore and Liz lonklin are
1502700	1509260	Standing in the dark of the woods is and you see working a body of Ken Krenkelhoff
1509260	1515340	What just fucking disappear into the ground ahead of you and it begins to rain
1515340	1520700	It's like pouring starts light, but you hear in the distance a storm is coming
1520700	1526460	Oh shit Liz, it sounds like a storms coming. He's gonna drown in that hole. I need you
1528260	1532140	I need you both through all sanity. I need it
1536860	1538740	27 on
1538740	1543220	75 damn he has good sanity. That's like the one good thing of all these characters
1544220	1549780	So you will not lose any sanity and you're like, yeah, you fell into a hole. He's just playing. Yeah
1551300	1556860	A 62 on wait, I'm confused. So you've got current and max. Okay. I think it's a 32
1556860	1562980	Yes, that would make sense and you rolled far above that. So you're gonna just lose one sanity putting your current at 31 and
1564100	1570520	Liz is gonna start to freak out a little bit. You're out here. You don't know what part of the woods you're in
1570620	1572620	You've never seen this cabin before
1573100	1575100	Ken Krenkelhoff
1575140	1582220	Prominent player in the stylus Cole K through 12 community just disappeared not only into the ground
1582220	1585140	But also off of your list of suitable bachelors
1587380	1592140	Wait, you mean you was considering freshman only one
1596460	1598460	Jeremy falls into a hole
1598460	1600460	Of
1600900	1602900	His own making
1604420	1608900	Okay, so where we are I'm going and see yeah a little bit
1611660	1617620	Do you guys want to move toward the cabin or move away from the cabin or I want to move towards the hole
1618700	1620020	Yeah, we saw okay
1620020	1625980	So moving up to the hole you would see that he slid into like a pile of leaves
1626420	1629540	That turned into a mudslide pit
1629540	1633220	It looks like the top of a slide that's made out of sludge that
1633460	1639420	Disappears at an angle into the ground and then looking forward you see the cabin
1639420	1646860	It's far more well lit. Now. The lights are on inside so you can see it from you know, the window lights
1646860	1654720	I suppose however, you can also see in the moonlight that outside there is a storage container seemingly like a small
1655560	1660040	rectangular box separate from the cabin itself as well as
1661440	1666920	Big yellow excavator sitting outside the cabin and about
1667800	1672640	ten yards away from the cabin encircling it is a moat and
1673280	1677800	The moonlight is reflecting off of the water of this moat
1677800	1683440	Both of you roll an alertness check for me. Actually, whoever's got a better alertness will count
1683560	1686160	50 same I rolled a 31 beautiful
1686160	1692280	We'll use that as you also notice that there are some fish flopping up out of the water
1692520	1697000	Strange for a moat size size of fish. Do we get to see them? Yeah, what was the size small mouth?
1697960	1698960	base
1698960	1704120	base bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb wow wow, you guys know how
1713440	1715440	Look in the moat
1729280	1732240	All right, I'm done all right, so you guys are
1743680	1748800	In the pale fish light wrong freshman and so you guys
1751040	1756600	It's a popular 90s how the song goes popular 90s song that I wasn't role-playing
1756640	1760040	I don't give a fuck. So you see that
1761480	1766740	What do you guys do does anyone want to take the slide or you're gonna approach the cabin this reminds me of that fish song
1767360	1773080	Not the band fish, but that song about the fish in the moonlight. I don't know. It's weird. What where did Ken go?
1773200	1777800	What what's going on? I mean, I've told people before but my buddies didn't believe me
1777800	1782980	But I've I've seen madge in these woods. Do you believe in old mange? What the hell is madge?
1782980	1785960	Oh man, just the witch that haunts these woods
1786920	1791080	And I think she might be the witch playing tricks on us tonight. Does she live in that house?
1791080	1793520	There's only one way to find out let's go
1793760	1800520	Approaching the moat you see that it is about five feet across to the other side. It's absurdly large moat for
1801360	1803360	a cabin in the woods
1803560	1807800	It's useful. Is there is the shed or any other thing on the other side of the moat?
1807800	1810520	Everything is inside the moat. You want to try to throw me across?
1813680	1820480	I like that you went to me throwing you and not you throw me throw me Liz Liz is so much smaller boy
1820480	1826440	Wait, we do we still have the other guy with him? No, he fell down the mud hole. No the other she lost sanity. Oh
1827280	1831660	Yeah, we were supposed to be finding him but good fucking look
1836640	1842240	Did you completely forget about your dog man, listen the way Zach is running this we're going in and out of this room
1842240	1844680	It's been a while. Yeah, we got rusty here
1846520	1848720	Can we throw rusty rusty
1848840	1853880	Why don't you make a human rusty is easily six foot three and I want him to make a human bridge
1854520	1860960	Across this river. Yes do it. I'm gonna throw so I'm gonna scatter some smokies like on the other side
1862000	1867720	And I like kind of like demonstrate with motions like what I want him to do to share the Smokies hold his feet
1867720	1869720	Make sure he doesn't jump and yeah pretty much
1870240	1872080	That's that's actually what I'll just do
1872080	1878400	I'll just like I'll toss some Smokies to the other like sure and I'll hold his feet as he leaps across for them
1880200	1882200	Okay, good idea Liz
1883000	1885000	Thanks, I
1885280	1888760	That happens and we eagerly run across his back
1890480	1892480	Which is Kevin, okay
1895680	1901560	Eagerly run across his back to a witch's cabin is a little too long for the episode title, but it's
1902400	1909360	It's close. So I need you whoever has the worst dexterity to roll dexterity. Probably me
1909360	1912800	I have 25 50. Yeah, Liz lonklin makes it across
1913800	1918480	Very easily. Oh shit. You better make it. I didn't 63. I
1919160	1921160	step on his balls
1921880	1928760	Rusty has his ankles on one shore being held by Jeremy petty more and he reaches out for the
1929080	1934960	tiny meat fingers on the other side of the moat and he
1935200	1940680	Grasps onto the ground on the other side and as soon as he makes that bridge connection
1940960	1945840	you know like when two grandmas become friends Liz lonklin just
1949040	1953720	Rushes across the body and rusty and Jeremy
1955040	1962360	following shortly after all people play bridge this is toe stuck right in the crotch of all rusty and
1963360	1965360	You know when you stub your toe on a taint
1966000	1972600	Everyone knows that sensation and so you fall and you hit rusty and you both fall into the moat
1972600	1974600	Well, I didn't put any points to swim
1975960	1981340	But I did put points into survival. So I'm gonna use my survival instincts to remember how to swim
1987240	1990680	What's your survival at 50 go ahead and roll on a 30
1991640	1993640	Really negative 20
1997240	2001680	21 that is a success. I that is a success
2004600	2008960	Can't wrinkle off no fuck sorry, Jeremy petty more just like
2009480	2014220	Hazardly throws his arms about thrashing in this fish filled water
2014220	2016220	Oh
2018220	2025220	Wait, I'm fine. I'm sorry and he crawls still think I'm cool on to the other side rolling my eyes a wet mess
2025220	2027220	Hi Liz
2028020	2033420	Rusty crawls out on the other side away from you on the other side. Yeah, do you run away?
2033420	2037640	He looks at Jeremy petty more and holds out his hand
2038860	2040860	for more flesh pencils
2041300	2045500	Okay, I like I drop a couple on this side of the river but I move on
2045500	2049820	Okay, as soon as you turn around and move on you hear him snacking behind you. He's cleared
2050460	2054340	Jumping over this five-foot wide moat and he is with okay
2054340	2059420	I want to leave Smokies like a like a little just a little trail the whole way I go
2059420	2065060	All right, and you guys are approaching this cabin where I so you've got two buildings and a giant excavator
2065260	2073140	One of the buildings is much smaller and is the size of like a small storage pod that you see sometimes in people's
2073180	2075580	driveways like before or after a move and
2076700	2082660	Then you have the cabin which has a front porch and a single door window on either side of the door
2082660	2086440	Can we choose to look in the window before pursuing?
2087060	2089300	Absolutely. All right, go ahead and roll stealth for me
2090700	2092700	Jeremy petty more. What are you doing? I'm
2093060	2095300	Edging my way towards the storage unit, okay
2098020	2101280	I rolled an 85 so you stumble up the
2101700	2107840	Stairs to the front porch of this cabin and like slam your hands down on the wooden porch
2108100	2114040	And then you walk up and you stick your head up in the window and looking inside
2114980	2122500	You see a lot of equipment that you have never seen in your entire life before this is not a home
2122880	2124880	this is a lab and
2126300	2129380	You see there are I'm having flashbacks to the OA
2130580	2133140	Translucent tubes. That's your fucking sock. I
2135420	2137780	Was just waiting for him to say that I
2138500	2143380	We're not talking about the OA. Okay, at the end they stop a school shooting with their
2144420	2147140	All right, the worst episode of television
2148020	2150020	You can just cut this watch the whole thing
2150940	2152980	First season. All right. Did you know?
2153700	2156940	Okay, moving on not after the first season. I
2157700	2160380	Heard it was good, but I can't imagine now. That's true
2162780	2164780	There's the edit point
2165020	2170980	Looking inside all of this equipment is completely outside your grasp. However, you see these
2171660	2178140	translucent tubes that are running all over the place up the walls along the ceiling and
2178540	2181620	Then they're going down into the floorboard
2182340	2185420	underneath and they are all filled with a
2186020	2187860	squeamish black
2187860	2194140	Viscous goo that is making its way below the cabin around on the other sides
2194140	2201320	You see a desk littered with papers so many papers strewn about there's like a cork board with a bunch of more papers
2201620	2207460	Thumb tacked up to it and you see in the corner of the room. There is a
2208140	2210140	large wooden trunk
2210500	2212900	Jeremy petty more you are edging
2216140	2223100	Go on your way make you wait for it. Yeah, you think so and
2225040	2230900	You don't come across the storage yet
2233980	2237780	But you you make your way over to the storage, you know
2238740	2246020	Okay, there's a daily Jeremy petty more wants to know if our actions in the past can affect the future you're in your present
2246020	2251460	I know so everything you do affects the future. Mm-hmm. What would you like to do Jeremy petty more?
2251460	2256380	I'd like to try to get into the storage shed. All right, Lindsay. I'm gonna have you leave the room. All right
2268140	2270140	You
2271340	2273940	Jeremy petty more you open up the door to this
2274580	2275780	small
2275780	2280740	Rectangular room as you do so a light comes on inside
2281660	2283660	It's dimly lit
2283900	2287420	But as you walk in or poke your head in
2288580	2295760	You see one side is a closet full of outfits on the other side of the room
2295760	2297160	You
2297160	2299880	Lined up hanging up against the wall
2301320	2303320	Are the bodies of?
2303400	2305400	roughly 15 people
2305560	2310800	they are all hanging on hooks from a hole in the back of their neck and
2312440	2318040	The way they are slumped makes you think that none of them have a spinal cord
2319880	2323740	Jeremy anymore turns to the door and he screams
2326600	2328600	Oh
2332600	2334600	Roll sanity
2338120	2340120	Yeah, then that was a great reaction
2340120	2342120	You
2354960	2358440	Lindsay I think you probably heard from the kitchen Thomas scream
2362240	2367920	And you see Jeremy petty more fucking book it out of this small external room
2368880	2373400	You're up on the porch, what do you do I run run towards the guy that helped us over the moat
2373640	2378680	He's just like on the ground eating smokies. You gotta toss some smokies. Fuck. I call them
2379240	2385920	I'm gonna like push him down and cross him over the bridge, but also leave some smokies behind me. So he doesn't totally hit us
2386720	2392560	But like I am in panic mode. I am fucking bolting. I am making my rusty bridge
2392600	2396120	I'm not even gonna worry about what's behind me. I'm just running for my life
2396120	2401000	I need both of you to roll an alertness or survival
2401000	2406040	Whichever one is higher for you. I passed both 30 on a 50 for both of those
2409680	2415240	56 on a 50 56 on a 50. All right, this will basically be
2416960	2418960	Lethality rule so
2419840	2421680	Oh
2421680	2427800	The two of you take off running you throw down rusty across the moat you make it to the other side you leave some
2428680	2430680	micro rusty run
2431000	2439000	Micro pains on the other side and as you dip into the woods Liz you hear a click underneath your foot
2439600	2444060	Can I immediately stop sure without pulling my foot up? Yeah, absolutely
2446000	2448220	And before you can let the breath out
2449800	2451520	a
2451520	2453520	giant metal claw
2454120	2461320	Swings down from the branch on the tree above you and takes your head clean off as blood begins
2462440	2470120	Burt out of the body above you and blood is literally showering like Vegas water feature style
2470640	2474480	out of the space in between your shoulders and
2475240	2481880	You fall to your knees like shooting a guy in the dick and double-oh-seven you like hit your knees and then you hit your
2482280	2484280	shoulders on the ground
2484400	2489340	Jeremy petty more roll a sanity check Jeremy petty more doesn't see any of Jeremy petty more didn't see
2493920	2498900	Okay, actually roll alertness and see if you saw it you can do either one he's fine
2500600	2504200	He sees it he knows that he's the survivor and he keeps going
2504800	2506800	He got a 29
2508640	2514460	He's like well that was the cool older punk girl had a crush on but better her than me
2534480	2536480	Oh
2548480	2550840	That the time has come
2554560	2561240	To dance beneath a dance beneath the shadow of the moon
2564480	2584040	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
2584040	2588640	She moves, she moves, she moves
2588640	2592640	With the howling wind
2594640	2600440	The sun, the sun, the sun
2600440	2604640	Has come again, come again
2605640	2611240	Her eyes, her eyes
2611240	2615240	Have seen it all
2617240	2622240	The wonders of, the wonders of
2622240	2625240	The shadow of the moon
2634640	2649040	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
