0	9640	Welcome one, welcome all, welcome y'all, wait a minute, did I say this all before?
9640	12880	Have I lived this moment in another time?
12880	18560	It feels like I'm having one of them damn dirty deja vu moments, where you feel like
18560	24380	you did a thing before in an alternate reality type deal maybe, but now you're doing it in
24380	31700	this one for the first time, but a second time, anyway.
31700	36500	Speaking of endless cycles of torture that I am forced to relive every week, it's time
36500	38420	for Howlin' with Wolf.
38420	43060	This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Ian, who wrote a five star review of this show
43060	45820	like the sweet, sweet boy he is.
45820	50500	Hey everybody, be more like Ian, he writes.
50500	54040	Dear Wolf, I hope this letter finds you well.
54040	57400	Needless to say, I'm a huge fan of your show.
57400	61920	Not only for the soothing sounds you howl through the airwaves each week, your DJing
61920	67920	prowess and your spectacularly diverse discography, but you are hands down the most reliable source
67920	74200	of news that the mainstream media won't report on, those otherworldly happenings in the town
74200	75900	of contention.
75900	81280	My neighbor's got a sister in contention, and even he doesn't know what's going on.
81280	86180	Then again, he really hasn't been himself since last week when I returned that shiny
86180	89540	ball bearing he dropped out in the parking lot.
89540	94200	Didn't even thank me, he's usually a pretty chill guy, but the other night he woke up
94200	99840	half the apartment complex screaming and carrying on at two in the morning, thrashing and banging
99840	103560	around like we're living in college dorms again or something.
103560	108640	When I knocked on his door to ask what the hell he was doing, or more importantly why
108640	114400	he was spattered and marinara and holding what looked like a fake spinal cord, he just
114400	119160	said, uh, Halloween, and shut the door in my face.
119160	124620	It ain't even October, now he just stares at me coldly every time I pass by on my way
124620	128960	to the mailbox, sorry, totally got sidetracked there.
128960	134240	Anyway, love the show, keep on howling the good howling snapping those pearly fangs at
134240	137480	Mark Zuckerberg's milk toast android ass.
137480	142080	You're the wolf now, dawg, your friend and admirer, Ian.
142080	143080	P.S.
143080	148080	If you could do me a huge favor and dig into the deep cuts, I'd love to hear you spin something
148080	150960	a little different from the usual setlist.
150960	155160	Do you have no backbone by kudzu in your collection?
155160	156160	Thanks a million.
156160	159360	No, thank you, listener.
159360	164600	All-profit news stations are designed to keep you scared and coming back so they can make
164600	166720	that sweet, sweet cash money.
166720	173640	I like to keep y'all scared, but I do it for free because I'm a true radio journalist DJ
173640	180720	of high caliber, and, uh, it gets me off to know the power I hold, and, baby, you know
180720	185320	I'm always scrounging for them deepest of cuts when it comes to tunes.
185320	190000	I might have a little something special just for you this time.
190000	194760	Remember, if you want to write a message for me to read on air, tag us on Instagram or
194760	200480	Twitter at PretendingPod, or write a five star review on Apple Podcasts and email us
200480	203280	at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.
203280	207320	And the conglomerate of pretending to be people want me to keep shouting out that they are
207320	214080	taking questions for a third Q&A episode, so if you have questions for any of the mature,
214080	220200	most thoughtful adults who make that show, tag at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram.
220200	224560	There's also a post in the subreddit where you can comment your questions.
224560	229400	Or go all out, record audio of you asking a question and send that so they can use it
229400	230960	in the episode.
230960	235920	Same as the second Q&A episode, this one will be for our honorary police officers over on
235920	241240	Patreon who plug the holes of this sinking ship five bucks a month at a time.
241240	246400	The anthropomorphic corks who hold this whole thing together currently have instant access
246400	253240	to six exclusive bonus episodes, with more on its way, so much more.
253240	258080	Now if you want a question answered but you can't rationalize making room in your budget,
258080	259080	fear not.
259080	264680	There are already so many questions the PTBP crew won't be able to get to all of them.
264680	269720	For some of the questions missed on the recording, the boys will journey into the hardline mainframe
269720	273720	network and answer right there inside your phone or laptop.
273720	277520	They'll be all up inside them internet guts.
277520	281800	Speaking of crawling into other people's business, it's the news.
281800	287640	Clock Bishop Keith Vigna and John Lee Pettymore the fourth, in the body of John Lee Pettymore
287640	292140	the third, woke up in the tomb of Ari Manstein.
292140	295800	They had four names branded on different parts of their bodies.
295800	301760	On the backs Drew, on the bottom of their left foot Maggie, on the palms of their dominant
301760	307720	hands Tilly, and on the chests Marvin, but Marvin is crossed out.
307720	314120	After realizing they have the moments of the, I guess successful, raid on the glass compound,
314120	318980	the three former officers from contention began to understand the situation they found
318980	320200	themselves in.
320520	325940	Clark tried to summon another version of himself, looked a little too deep into his collective
325940	330800	unconsciousness and received a phone call from his former boss.
330800	336040	Taking us now to the parking lot of the city cemetery where Maggie Cook just assigned the
336040	341960	three dilapidated husks of humanity she once called co-workers with the task of taking
341960	343400	out Bruce Robin.
343400	349000	Ferguson Bean's former business partner is a personal favorite of mine and a brand new
349000	351720	single from Kudzu.
351720	355080	Y'all ain't never gonna guess what it is.
355080	358440	It's no backbone baby I fooled y'all.
358440	385880	I am John Lee Paddymore, doo da doo da, I am John Lee Paddymore, oh the doo da day.
385880	389440	We sound cool.
389440	395920	So you guys woke up in the tomb of Ari Manstein and then you realized like you do and you
395920	401460	realized that Marvin which was carved into your chest or burned into your chest rather
401460	407040	is crossed through with the same sort of burning all the way through which we took as a clear
407040	412120	indication that that was done and we have nothing to follow up on there and you didn't
412120	420880	talk about it at all well and then eventually leaving the tomb you ran into the old woman
420880	428880	making her way out of the cemetery and she was so slow oh my god and that's when you
428880	433920	realized that you had been here before the thing that you had been debating up until
433920	438520	that point she had seen us run through before exactly and then you almost ruined the entire
438520	444960	podcast by just standing there and waiting that's not totally off the table yeah we still
444960	450560	might do that and I don't understand how uh pushing you to new creative heights by thinking
450560	457200	outside the box is ruining the podcast I say what's ruining the podcast okay okay okay
457200	465440	podcast strike boys our characters sit there and wait we're out and no one's allowed to
465440	476560	cross us Zach just hires scabs so with us this week we've got Ali Jepson playing John
476560	482660	Lee Pettymore he just does all the voices himself he's like finally my dream the game
482660	488080	will go the way I want it to go so you guys are all standing in the parking lot Maggie
488080	494460	Cook has joined you she has driven up into this parking lot and has given you a job to
494460	502720	do which is to take out or essentially murder Bruce Robin full owner of bar Corp and the
502720	509420	one-time business partner of Keith vigna's brother Ferguson beans she is sitting in this
509420	516260	car broken down crying after having a conversation with John Lee Pettymore the third who well
516260	520800	there's something yeah there's something I want to add to that actually that I just kind
520800	526540	of realized you're allowed to you know Maggie I know this is a hard time for you reckoning
526540	532120	with my undeath and all but I I just realized I'm doing the same thing with you what the
532120	538340	fuck how are you alive and as you ask that her phone starts to ring I like I put my hand
538340	544480	on her hand and I'm like Maggie tell me damn it she looks at the call as Clark Bishop is
544480	550720	walking back over to join the group after looking at his cell phone and his car there
550720	558120	she looks at the phone she puts it down she's like alright I John I gotta take this just
558120	563440	real quick and then I'll explain okay I need Joe to roll an alertness check for me real
563440	577400	quick I pass 18 or 70 Joe as you walk back you actually hear a second vibration so her
577400	590120	phone is ringing and you hear a second buzzing at a different pitch we're from from inside
590120	597480	her car where she's sitting in the driver's seat and then she picks up the phone Leon oh okay Lee
597480	608240	Leon do you trust me and do your fucking job Leon I know it's been a while but knock the dust off
608240	615520	your knuckles and buckle up what controls this world Leon that's right bitch it's fire and as
615520	620360	soon as she's done speaking she hangs up she looks at you and she's like I never died John I
620360	631840	had to disappear whose body was that doesn't matter she just how did you get so cool John
631840	637040	I've always been this cool I think you've just been too drunk to notice and then she grabs an
637040	644400	envelope out of her shotgun seat and she throws it to you right out the window and she looks at
644400	652040	you and she's like remember I'm counting on you just Maggie just because I gave you bourbon for
652040	664480	Christmas doesn't mean I'm a drunk cheap shitty bourbon and then she drives off to clarify the
664480	669480	high-pitched buzzing that I heard she didn't acknowledge she did not got it but it sounded
669480	674720	just like a cell phone yes got it open that envelope so isn't that a little blur the manila
674720	683040	envelope has a manila folder inside labeled operation hole puncher colon bar Corp you remember the
683040	691960	we found that in the secret room with the Jim Cook's house in the secret room can you remind
691960	700000	us what we knew about it operation home I'm sorry of course we remember everything can you remind
700000	707920	the listeners there was a folder on the desk in that room that secret hidden room that said
707920	713960	operation hole puncher on the outside of it with the logo for the circle of knowledge the circle
713960	720680	surrounded by six circles and inside there is a list of nonprofits charities think tanks and
720680	729160	universities that are quote-unquote owned by the spark or knowledge oh okay where have we heard
729160	739440	bar Corp before that's a Fergie and Bruce Roberts Robbins beans and Robin corporation is bar Corp one
739440	745160	of those that's listed under companies owned by the circle of knowledge or yes it's in that list
745160	750600	yes okay I found where I wrote down this in my real-life notebook and I wrote down each each
750600	755480	company has date slash phone that phone number next to it isn't still the case so that was a
755480	761600	different folder than this one this one gotcha a lot of information just about bar Corp in it
761600	767440	whereas the other one was just a list of companies with a name and her biome got it so inside is a
767440	774920	full rundown of bar Corp it's two owners Ferguson beans and Bruce Robin it's three subsidiaries

789120	797680	over 850 million dollars paid zero dollars in taxes and there's an estimate that this year they
797680	804760	will make over two billion dollars you also see that Ferguson beans is marked as deceased his
804760	813400	majority share in the company was split between his wife Stacy his daughter Francis and the mill
813400	819000	on the other side of the city this leaves the majority in the legal document that is how it's

889960	895080	know it was to a church I just heard that but my associate had a good had a good connection and it
895080	900760	turned out to be a very fancily dressed man well in a van that what was he wearing I remember very
900760	907040	very plainly the red rose pinned to his lapel Keith's face kind of drops a little bit he pulls
907040	915320	out his phone opens up a picture of Ferguson to him yeah that's my brother oh he was fucking
915320	924000	weird that makes sense so John you sold evidence cocaine to aren't we past that too I mean we've
924000	934920	been personally a giant ball monster like how you gonna worry about me selling a little bit of you
934920	940080	know contraband some good times I guess I guess we are a little past procedure but I wonder what
940080	944700	Fergie was doing with that did you know your brother to be a dealer I didn't really know my
944700	949080	brother that well towards the end anyway well he was there with a bunch of kids so maybe he was
949080	955840	giving it to them he had kids at the drug deal the ministry yeah he drove up in a ministry van and he
955840	962800	got out with a bunch of little children's and and they they dug up the cocaine that I had buried on
962800	971600	my property he made the kids dig up the cocaine Keith sounds like your brother sucks he sucked
971600	978520	how are you doing with that you know I I made the decision what do you mean I mean I can't take it
978520	983600	back now I'm just trying not to think about it a lot happened in the past couple days you killed
983600	1001480	Fergie no I can say 100% with without lying to you I didn't kill him what decision did you make
1001480	1008480	Keith I will say if it wasn't for me he'd probably still be alive but I didn't kill him if I remember
1008480	1013200	right Marvin Glass mentioned all this when you and I were in his office while it was flooded
1013520	1021160	anyway I think that I know that yeah office when it flooded well yeah Keith when we were in the
1021160	1026400	office when it was all you know what we can we can talk about that later looks like we got other
1026400	1031880	stuff to focus on wait wait hold on Marvin's office flooded with you in it because the last
1031880	1036160	thing we saw was Marvin and a bunch of people bursting out of a flooded office well we had
1036160	1041760	been in the office when it was flooded and then before right after that we kind of just woke up
1042000	1049040	thrown into combat see I was a I was trying to save you and I saw your body was pressed against
1049040	1054920	a window down there and I shot it out and then all hell broke loose so what do we think happened
1054920	1062960	between then and John we were after the the room flooded I'd he Marvin grabbed a hold of me grabbed
1062960	1071320	a key showed up eventually but he he hope he opened you up he popped you open and there was
1072320	1083240	one of those one of those little silver balls was inside of you well yeah hey boys we might all be
1083240	1090520	silver balls just so you know there could be a silver ball on you right now oh yeah I mean I'm
1090520	1098840	pretty sure I am the silver ball when my Kevin father killed my my err body my first John yeah
1098840	1105840	what happened then is that I burst out of my own spine and into his because I think I'm just a
1105840	1110600	little ball that rings that rings a bell actually because I've seen those balls rip spines out of
1110600	1116560	people before and pop themselves in the place I mean I saw that when I was looking at videos
1116560	1123920	at the glass compound I saw that happen a couple times on video so well so yeah so I'm a ball and
1123920	1132400	as you can see I have the capacity to be on the side of good are you all ball I like flex and I
1132400	1139120	show off my tight pants and I'm like hell no man have you always been ball when you were first John
1139120	1145120	was that ball did I only ever know a ball I think I was a ball you were bald in I think so why don't
1145120	1149200	you remember if you were ball you'd be a ball you know you were a ball well hey man being a ball
1149200	1159280	just feels like being you or me so you're I could be ball yeah that's what I I really don't know
1159280	1165760	who's ball and who's not but a lot of us could be ball honestly Keith vigna is just looking but in
1165760	1173680	between these two having just no almost no clue what's going well you see Keith I'm a ball I'm
1173680	1179040	just like kind of nodding my head like I think I might be ball to my ball I don't I don't know I
1179040	1184160	might be ball I don't think I'm ball I don't hold on hold on hold on hold on all right I want you
1184160	1188440	all just turn around and I'm gonna give you a little John Lee petty more patented neck rub and
1188440	1193800	we're gonna see if I feel anything weird in that spot of yours what if you ball me what if I don't
1193800	1199040	what if I'm not balling you ball me I promise not to follow you just let me give you a little neck
1199040	1206760	rip and then John Lee petty more gets in there and he's like god damn it's good it's firm but
1206760	1214360	sensitive it's for the first time in days your attention leaves Clark's shoulders I'm following
1214360	1222520	your muscles and your bones perfectly and it's just like fuck you feel like a dog basically a
1222640	1230440	regular John Peters the best pet of its life and after I'm done I'm like well I'm no anatomy
1230440	1238560	expert but John Lee petty more is a back rub expert and I don't see any signs of ball from
1238560	1242840	that I have no idea how that presents in the anatomy what I've seen but thank you for letting
1242840	1247400	me lay on hands it's been in the head it's been in the skull us I sinked it in you and I saw it
1247400	1253560	having a rosemary where you saw a ball and rosemary so in the office previous when things were bad
1253560	1260960	rosemary made a move for the gun the tube gun on the desk of Marvin in his office I don't know what
1260960	1266040	her plan was but Marvin wait a minute rosemary turned against Marvin at the last minute and
1266040	1271560	Marvin flung one of those silver balls at her oh buddy I think I know why wait what happened okay
1271560	1276280	hold on what happened when he threw the silver ball crack cracked her open and took her spine
1276280	1281680	out and replaced it he threw the ball at her through the ball at her and it popped her open
1281680	1287480	like a can of soda and ripped out her spine and replaced it dang oh yeah then the ball the silver
1287480	1293000	ball now inhabiting rosemary as far as I know pulled the trigger and she disappeared did we
1293000	1298760	see rosemary as one of the corpses that came out of the the booth or whatever it was no no okay no
1298760	1303840	I didn't think so yeah all right so rosemary she was in love with Marvin's dog son yeah she was
1303840	1309120	trying to find his son the one who got gun by Tilly Marvin didn't really care but that's why
1309120	1314480	she wanted the gun Jermaine glass was she in one in love with the one who got evaporated to the
1314480	1318320	one who was turned into a fool the one who got evaporated yeah so she was trying to get that
1318320	1323840	gun to find him to get him back that's what I know about rose well I was confused at the time
1323840	1328360	and I still am about the whole business of her making a move at Marvin Marvin throwing the ball
1328360	1332440	at her like that would do like he knew it would do something but then it I don't know if it did
1332480	1336720	the thing he thought it was gonna do like she pulled the trigger either way based on all those
1336720	1341800	videos I saw Marvin knew what those balls would do Marvin does know what those balls would do and I
1341800	1348480	think he's creating or controlling them in some capacity when I was playing at juggernaut I mean
1348480	1359800	I became that from being a ball I rolled into into him and well what John Lee Pennymore sighs
1359880	1369760	a sweet nostalgic sigh he's back in his in a human body but he feels like he should be in a gigantic
1369760	1378080	metal sphere I was gonna call for a sanity check but it doesn't seem to fit your wistful not not
1378080	1385680	upset well guys I know that we just I know we just got tasked to kill Robin but before we do you do
1385680	1390200	you think he might know something about this oh I mean well yeah who knows we should definitely
1390200	1396520	interrogate anybody before we murder them but I so far I haven't seen any reason not to trust Maggie
1396520	1400320	not to murder again I mean I have but I she kind of she kind of addressed it well do you think we
1400320	1405720	should go to his house or to the wood to talk to bark or I'd lean toward going to his house
1405720	1410040	and just seeing what kind of personal files he's got do you have his number or maybe like that is
1410280	1420680	mom's number his mom is dead oh and don't ask me how I know that how do you know that I killed her
1420680	1428840	we'll get to that later what no I yeah I didn't kill my brother I you know what I'll just tell
1428840	1434760	you the story I convinced her to kill my brother and then I killed her so she couldn't tell on me
1434760	1441760	hold and there you have it let's let's let's you know what we'll cop we'll get to that no way
1441760	1447960	probably never again let's just never talk about it all cops are bastards me too I don't really
1447960	1454160	identify as a cop anymore really but uh what what why did you by proxy kill your brother
1454160	1465520	for money which I never ended up seeing you know the more I think about it the more I'm glad we
1465520	1471600	aren't cops anymore fellas you've all done some pretty you want to go sleep we can still use our
1471600	1479080	investigative skills sell some drugs that I found in the course of an investigation that's to a man
1479120	1485600	with children that is routine cop work I think a lot of drug dealers have kids they don't employ
1485600	1495440	a lot of kids I think a lot of drug dealers are kids you guys want to go sneak around his
1495440	1501120	house and see what we can find yeah I think we should do his house it's insert time here
1501120	1508360	he's probably not at home it's roughly 2 p.m. on December 6th which is a Saturday I guess
1508360	1512880	fuck he could be home or he's out partying I mean if it's home that's I mean it's a little early
1512880	1518000	honestly 2 p.m. at a Saturday is exactly when he would be home that's it that's fine though I mean
1518000	1525960	let's go it's yeah yeah we also our police still kind of we have badges I never left I've always
1525960	1531160	considered myself a cop of contention well let's go whether I be drug dealer or a giant metal ball
1531160	1536240	man I've been looking out for the people back home does he live in the city or yeah you're in
1536240	1540800	the city now boys does he live here she lives downtown perfect we don't have jurisdiction so
1540800	1548760	we can obviously commit an extra judicial killing without any paperwork yeah well at least less
1548760	1557920	paperwork I mean for us I mean let's go see what we could find out then yeah some smug city cop
1557920	1563280	looking down on the small town fuzz you guys want to take my car the only one they're hopping I get
1563280	1572560	in you hop into Clark's silver Honda Accord Honda make your dreams drive is this the Accord sport
1572560	1578960	it's a exhale II exactly Maggie gave it to me I don't know what we're in here and you guys take
1578960	1586480	off downtown to a two-story brownstone in the city when you arrive you find parking decently nearby
1586480	1591800	actually go ahead and roll for parking no I don't give a shit so you guys show up well I crit failed
1591800	1599840	and you find the number on the door is 218 but probably more important than that is that there
1599840	1607400	is police tape over the door are there any cars in the park the driveway not a driveway no driveway
1607400	1614160	for this brownstone here is it a home like a row or a large brick row house well there's other ones
1614160	1618960	that look just like it on the other side and it's really nice it's like a very very nice street that
1618960	1624280	you're on there's a park across the street well if I learned anything as a cop it's that this do
1624280	1631120	not cross tape is not very strong and I rip it and I think if you'd learned anything it as a cop
1631120	1636920	it's that do not cross does not apply to you that's true and I jiggle the handle of the door
1636920	1644960	I kind of put the tape back so no one follows this you like tie it together yeah yeah title
1644960	1655920	not in it good as new is the door unlocked ha the door is unlocked nice I rolled an 88 for the
1655920	1663120	yeah who was there last to remember to lock the door yeah I walk on it was a real kid's a big
1663120	1673200	night surprise yourself with that role you're like of course not why would it be unlocked yeah when
1673200	1678560	you guys walk in the stench is the first thing you notice like a dead body would any of you have
1678560	1684000	been in a heroin den working in the contention PD probably not in contention probably not like
1684000	1689360	you do you know what it smells like I know what a meth house smells like I've been in one of those
1689360	1695400	and it's bad it's like poop and cigarettes it smells like poop and cigarettes and heroin hmm
1695400	1702280	it is a fucking wreck there's trash everywhere most of the furnishings that should be here are
1702280	1708720	gone there's like pallets made all over the place but there's actual human fecal matter just like
1708720	1714040	strewn about seems that people were like stepping in it and tracking it all around the place smells
1714040	1722040	like piss spray-painted on one of the walls Heisenberg is eight one one eight one eight nine
1722040	1731680	five two zero one three one one eight one one one nine got it did you really I started writing
1731680	1737400	about midway I'd lost it does that have any significance to us it's on the wall is that
1737400	1747560	we said spray-painted roll again for me signals intelligence I have a zero so no don't roll
1747560	1753760	signals for me so no none of you would be able to I'm gonna put anything together I'm gonna take a
1753760	1764960	picture of it so we have it for later nice so what is it eight one etc etc and go ahead in first just
1764960	1768920	tell me what you guys are doing when you are in here like I'm just looking around for anything
1768920	1774400	that isn't just gross anything that sticks out that's not you know drugged in ask Clark is
1774400	1781640	saying hello you hear nothing except for your partners rifling through all this shit it seems
1781640	1789280	that everything that would have been in a place this nice is long gone drawers have been pulled
1789280	1796480	out of cabinets and doors are open everywhere everything is just strewn about and everything
1796480	1802360	that was once clean is no longer or not here anymore since this is such a nice place are there
1802360	1812320	any security cameras around in the house roll luck of fail no not a crit fail just to fail okay
1812320	1818560	I'd like to run up to the next floor and see if it's as decrepit and heroin II and shitty when you
1818560	1824320	get up to the second floor the hair on the back of your neck stands up and I roll an alertness
1824320	1833800	or a search you can roll search for me 19 and as your grit fail okay as you're walking through
1833800	1842400	the hallway you see there's a few rooms up here in a bathroom and there's just this heavy presence
1842400	1850240	that you've never felt before and carved into the walls in this room that is maybe had been
1850240	1856240	an office at one point in time is the same set of numbers that you saw spray-painted downstairs
1856240	1864960	eight one one eight one eight nine five two zero one three one one eight one one one nine and it
1864960	1873080	is carved over and over and over on everything in here using a simple substitution cipher with
1873080	1879000	you know one equaling a and so on do I get any new words out of this do I take a break and give
1879000	1895640	it a go fuck no just tell me yes but just I mean it's like ha ha ha ha no okay obviously that
1895640	1901160	wouldn't so I actually I'd be down to spend a few minutes looking at it I don't know we might find
1901160	1905880	fun stuff off mic though but we can bring it back I don't know take a hot piss and let's see if we
1905880	1926040	can figure it out off mic so did you guys figure it out yeah it's pretty obvious yeah I mean it's
1926040	1930400	it's very elementary once you get right into it so we can probably just breeze through that
1931360	1939200	listeners have it by now anything else in this room besides carvings on the wall besides the
1939200	1946640	obvious thing the painful easy cipher the really easy one that we figured out for sure no are there
1946640	1950480	any like closets or doors or anything did he leave a note saying where he went some of the
1950480	1956520	doors have even been taken off and the closet doors are all open and it's the same situation
1956840	1963080	and garbage yeah can I look in the bedroom and tell I don't know if it looks like it's been used
1963080	1968120	recently I'm trying to get a gauge of how long it's been like in this state it looks like what
1968120	1973080	could be like the master bedroom or at least the bedroom one of the bedrooms upstairs that's large
1973080	1981560	and has a bathroom attached the bed is gone the bed frame is gone and there are pallets all over
1981560	1985720	the place like there have been like 20 people sleeping right here can I look in the fridge
1985720	1992800	or the kitchen see what I glean from the kitchen when you go through the fridge it is sparse there
1992800	2001160	is like some rotten food but then there's also like some takeout a lot of like fast food that's
2001160	2007320	been like half eaten and stuff I want to call the city PD not like the normal number but like the
2007480	2012360	fellow cop number sure calling an office and basically I want to say like yeah this is John
2012360	2018360	Lee Pettymore out of contention we got a case about a drifter who might have committed some
2018360	2022760	property crimes down here and we might have tracked him to a drug hideout up there in the
2022760	2028760	city y'all had some police tape up around it so we didn't go inside but I was of course wondering
2029560	2034360	whatever information you had on that if you could get it to me about who was living there how long
2034360	2040360	it had been in that state as a drug squat whether or not the owner of the residence was participating
2040360	2050600	in in that squat oh yeah sure oh that's 501 east fake street so it's 218 is the address okay and
2052120	2055800	I said it wasn't as important as the police tape over the door that doesn't mean it's not important
2055800	2065320	oh 218 yeah that's Bruce Robin's home and uh he dipped out of there a few days ago seemingly and
2065320	2072280	we questioned some of the neighbors and they said that he was going absolutely crazy he was not
2072280	2078760	acting like himself and he was uh had just people coming in at all time of the day and night and
2078760	2086200	just inviting them all in and and then he just disappeared probably two days ago and they haven't
2086200	2091000	seen him since so the squat was was established already there were there were all kinds of
2091000	2096920	unstable characters coming around while Mr. Robin was still in residence seemingly for a short
2096920	2103320	amount of time but I you don't want to go in there it is absolutely disgusting they did a number on
2103320	2109240	that place in such a short amount of time I mean it was truly horrific stuff did y'all have any
2109240	2115720	leads uh about where Mr. Robin went we might want to interview him about our subject honestly you
2115720	2121640	know he's a high profile member of the community and we're just kind of putting it on the back
2121640	2128440	burner I understand uh you know cops exist to protect the capitalist superstructure under which
2128440	2135800	we we uh we serve so that's you're doing your job we looked into it and his mother died recently
2135800	2143240	and uh she hey now that's the lead his business partner is also dead oh god tragic so he seems
2143240	2148360	to have been going through some stuff and if you know mental illness is a serious issue here in
2148360	2154840	the city and really all over the world and no no no I mean not in contention we just uh we just uh
2154840	2160760	if you're not acting normal you know we either send you to a lot of church or we make you feel
2160760	2167800	alienated until you just leave or kill yourself it's the it's the small town way jesus christ
2169480	2172280	yeah his voice changes and he says jesus christ
2173400	2177800	keith can only hear one side of this conversation I'm like what the fuck
2178760	2184440	I was just like I'm just telling them about small town life well well shit but what's
2184440	2189640	our next step we came real close to doing it to you when you first came to the department I tell you
2194200	2198600	would you have sent keith vigna to church or would you have alienated him we tried to send the
2198600	2204680	boy to church we tried he didn't seem to get along too well with the pastor no one saw him show up
2204680	2211560	yeah I did like uh the all-you-can-eat buffets they had yeah I remember how you took advantage
2211560	2217400	of the lord's hospitality we got to find this guy he's obviously not here should we I mean go
2217400	2221960	to bar corp do you fellas think it's worth talking to the neighbors ourselves I was thinking about it
2221960	2230040	but if I mean since we're here I guess roll search whoever has the best search roll search for me I
2230040	2239160	ain't got it I got the baseline 20 I've got a 50 yeah yeah I have 40 so 76 all right yeah then uh
2239160	2244120	making a final pass through the home favorite uh you accidentally step in a pile of piss
2245320	2252200	you know how piss piles it's a huge stack of piss watch out for that stack of piss
2252440	2261080	hot piss no it's cold it's coagulated at this point gross it's not so uh I guess do you want
2261080	2264760	to go knock on a neighbor's door or are you Phil is thinking what I'm thinking as far as
2265800	2271480	what are you what do you think well we know about a bunch of people being destitute that's kind of
2271480	2275640	a thing we learned oh yeah we learned that Kathy was kind of running homeless people around at
2275640	2281080	various folks yeah but they weren't so much the heroin living their own shit kind of destitute
2281080	2285160	was it well they didn't smell good I think that was one thing that Keith confirmed for I mean I
2285160	2289560	was on a bus full of four of them and but you're right they weren't necessarily it was not a good
2289560	2295160	smell they weren't necessarily drug does Keith remember the smell does Keith recognize the smell
2295160	2299800	of the bus yeah could any of them have come out of the squat or is it into smell is one of the
2299800	2307640	strongest uh you know memory senses Keith vigna give me a smell roll you've been doing a fair
2307640	2315960	amount of cocaine the past few days give me a luck roll I got a six oh no a nine but still
2317080	2323240	that's lower than what my luck is this is a different smell okay I do one last big breath
2323240	2329640	in I'm like definitely not the bus uh homeless bus smell I trust your smells hey y'all I mean
2329640	2334680	why don't we just call him call robin call robin you could be like do we have his phone number in
2334680	2339560	that envelope you would have his direct number yeah it's not a bad idea Keith could call him
2339560	2343880	just checking in about his brother yeah as far as you know you don't know anything or and wanting
2343880	2350840	to commiserate about the mother yeah he lost his mother Keith lost his brother uh yeah have you met
2350840	2356760	robin no I haven't but uh you know we're both aware of each other you know I'd give him a call
2356760	2361400	you would hope a call from a good Samaritan a time of need would you both have something to relate to
2361400	2366120	it it could play yeah I give it I'll ring him you want to put that on speakerphone for us I do
2366120	2373080	obviously after we step out of this hell hole okay so back in the car I assume sure are you
2373080	2377080	guys just standing on the street should we walk around the block before we get back in the car
2378280	2383400	get the smell off just because of the smell oh yeah I thought you meant for more investigating
2383400	2388440	which is also an idea talk to the neighbors but uh I mean let's make the call in the privacy of
2388440	2393800	the car but we don't have to leave beep boop boop as you guys are walking back to the car
2393800	2400200	just a reminder of what the city looks like flowers everywhere oh yeah it's different than
2400200	2407640	contention uh the filter sickly green on the coloration yeah sickly green tint with heavy
2407640	2413640	grays the streets are covered in trash and spilled liquids and there's a scent in the air like
2413640	2419160	someone left out cheese and a colostomy bag on every corner the faces of the buildings are
2419160	2425960	slathered in billboards and the faces of the people bumbling about are bloated and lifeless
2425960	2432440	in a strange opposition to all this depressive scenery there are beautiful flowers in every shade
2432440	2438200	and shape growing in every otherwise empty alleyway and out of many cracks in the sidewalks
2438200	2444040	and roads I want to find the most lifeless looking person passing and I want to tap them
2444040	2451000	on the shoulder sorry why are you so pallid and corpse lack oh work's been pretty hard recently
2451000	2456200	I guess where do you work the corp uh bar corp yeah they gave us some days off though which is
2456200	2461640	nice so I think I've got a little bit more color to my cheeks than I did recently oh they're
2461640	2467240	positively rosy they're paying us time and a half to take like two weeks off two weeks off for a
2467240	2472920	whole massive corporation like that yeah it's crazy right why I don't know something about the
2472920	2480840	new takeover uh our new CEO Bruce Robin he's uh he's doing like some cool stuff he's like trying
2480840	2487000	to renovate everything apparently he's gonna make everyone have livable wage and benefits that are
2487000	2493320	realistically priced for all workers uh I guess we're getting better hours and yeah he's renovating
2493320	2498920	all the facilities to be up to code so we're all getting paid during the time off time and a half
2498920	2503720	but we could actually get even more if we help with the renovations do you know where he's
2503720	2508600	overseeing these renovations no I think he's just at the office but that's just an assumption he
2508600	2513720	doesn't come out to the sites very often sir what do you what do you do for bar corp in particular
2513720	2520680	what's your job data analyst and analyst I work at the office of the head office yeah I'm a data
2520680	2529000	analyst like what Thomas said that's a that's a uh soul-crushing job a great nondescript standard
2529000	2534440	office job to just throw out there samesies yeah all right well thank you thank you for your time
2534440	2540120	sir well yeah have a blessed day I remember Joe asked back when we first entered the city I asked
2540120	2546040	uh rosemary if those flowers were always there can you remind me if you said yes or no whether they
2546040	2550280	were a new thing to the city or if it's always been that way petty more asked rosemary if the
2550280	2557160	city is always this floral and she said yeah okay hey Keith what's what's barcorp do what what is
2557160	2562520	barcorp do they manufacture something other than these subsidiaries do they do something so I didn't
2562520	2574040	talk to my brother much he was rich something to do with money that's legitimately exactly how much
2574040	2583000	Keith vigna knows like the making of it or the managing of it or the financial institution or
2583000	2588440	just some comes in some goes out more comes in than than goes out though I think because they're
2588440	2593560	pretty successful I'll see they sell I assume they sell stuff I want to ask this guy that we
2593560	2599800	were just talking to hey oh hey what sorry more human connection what what does barcorp do we're
2599800	2604200	a corporation for the people do you sell something yeah I mean sure what do you sell
2604200	2609240	oh lots of things do you have anything on you pull out anything that's like in your pocket
2609240	2614840	I pull out a pen yeah we made that I look at the pen does it say barcorp roll sanity no
2616040	2621400	are you in the food business oh yeah I could call somebody and find out I have the CEO's number
2621400	2631000	okay bye I mean we could if you have like the number for Fergie at the corporation then it

2721440	2727200	totally and then I want to call yeah I want to call Ferguson's office number and try to talk to
2727200	2738120	his secretary Winifred Worth's office hey this is Ferguson beans I'm not dead no sorry you're the
2738120	2743440	same gentleman Keith beans you just called your Ferguson's brother why did you say that no I'm
2743440	2750000	Ferguson and she is old it sounds like so she doesn't remember what Ferguson sounds like he's
2750000	2759440	my brother we sound very similar I'm whip-crack smart and you sound like an idiot now is this
2759440	2770400	some sort of prank on Bruce tell the DM what's going on I try what I really liked was when we
2770400	2776080	played with a different DM this past weekend who was not Zach and you tried and he was just like
2780640	2786520	I hang up I hang up I'm like damn I thought that would definitely work
2786520	2793400	Winifred Worth is good at her job she fucking keeps it locked down we found out where Bruce
2793400	2798280	is I mean he's there right now we could I mean once we get up to the 17th floor and bust in with
2798280	2803520	some fucking cop uniforms on you know some yeah some uh she doesn't know what I look like breakers
2803520	2807680	with some initials on the back yeah if we just go up there it's just police business I mean there's
2807680	2812600	no reason they can't stop yeah I mean I would like to see Winifred Worth try to stop us after
2812600	2816920	hearing that phone call on speaker we were just talking to that fella and it sounds like Bruce
2816920	2822440	is maybe doing some good for this city as well that's what they told the workers that's true
2822440	2828880	maybe things has changed nothing going on in this city that was good so I'll believe it when I see
2828880	2833760	it but I say we go try to confront him see what we can get out of him then his business partner
2833760	2838280	was a man who bought cocaine in a van full of children how do we think that Robin is any better
2838280	2843080	but according to this guy it's because he's now CEO he said a bunch of changes were coming and
2843080	2848760	that they were positive all I mean is that he's the kind of guy who got into business with Ferguson
2848760	2854200	in the first place and is his heart that full of gold and someone that we trust wants us to kill
2854200	2860800	him yeah you're right we gotta I say we go I say we go I mean we go talk to him if we if we find
2860800	2865240	out some better information we could change her mind but I trust her that she's telling us these
2865240	2870040	things will stop this thing so I'm gonna do these things to stop the thing I don't know yeah I don't
2870040	2875160	know if I do trust this new well it was pretty cool I'll she faked her own death that was right
2875160	2880440	I mean I said earlier if you if you trust her I trust you not to mention the circle of knowledge
2880440	2886560	is what I've gleaned so far has been around for a while and seems to have been doing good being
2886560	2892560	keeping keeping with this awful thing was at bay let's go talk to Bruce just get some info yeah
2892560	2895680	maybe find out what other stuff the circle in the lodge has been up to
2916560	2920000	the only one trying to
