0	6160	Hello friends engulfed in flames, it's your local firefighter Wolf the Dog and I'm here
6160	11960	to spray your burning bodies down with all the hot gossip and news from Contingent at
11960	15960	694.2 BTBP my babies.
15960	22400	Now this week on Howlin with Wolf, your firefighter Wolf the Dog read some dope shit on the Glass
22400	32780	Canon Podcast subreddit, user BFEvans19 recommended 694.2 BTBP writing, among other lovely things
32780	38180	they quote, wanted to bring these guys to everyone's attention because I think they
38180	44780	bring the same energy to gaming that the GCP does and I expect that a lot of GCP fans would
44780	51300	also enjoy pretending to be people, y'all that shit means so much to your living Lexington
51300	52820	Wolf the Dog.
52820	56700	Speaking of tragedy, it's time for the news.
56700	62140	Last time was basically combat from the time the Robotman blasted the door from its frame,
62140	67780	to when the Robotman almost cut off Officer Bishop's arm, to when the Robotman froze at
67780	73260	the command of Officer Pettymore, to when the Robotman's torso flew out the window gripping
73260	75260	the throat of Officer Vigna.
75260	81700	Thank beans, he poked that terminator top in the eye just in time to escape before the
81700	84820	metal fella exploded like fireworks.
84820	90660	Speaking of fireworks, we got a musical mortar for y'all today and they're here to blow y'all's
90660	97060	brains up with their sound, it's kudzu with no backbone.
105260	115340	You got shit on your balls?
115340	118540	I got shit on my balls, you're exactly right.
118540	119540	I was leaning forward.
119540	120540	That's good luck.
120540	121540	Yeah.
121540	125300	Well, it took me like three wipes of just my balls to get the poop off of them.
125300	130180	Because it like hit full on, I was like, oh, I don't know that that has ever happened to
130180	131180	me before.
131180	134500	I think it's because it's a hot day and I'm wearing black jeans, so I had long balls.
134740	139860	I got two Cadbury eggs today.
139860	145940	At the end of the last episode, the large metal man's torso unattached from its lower
145940	151300	half and a small jetpack began shooting flames from the bottom of its torso.
151300	156220	It grabbed Keith by the throat and flew through the window of the living room into the front
156220	157220	yard.
157220	161580	Keith bit into the mechanical hand and two of his teeth broke off.
161580	164140	Keith then poked its one good eye.
164140	168940	The thing dropped Keith onto the front lawn and then flew up into the night sky where
168940	172100	it exploded like fireworks.
172100	173100	What do you do?
173100	178780	I cheer because I love fireworks.
178780	182100	I think I just moan in pain for a while.
182100	183100	Yeah.
183100	186900	I might be real close to passing out from pain.
186900	192540	I try to get up off the ground, but having, I assume my ribs broken from that crowbar
192540	204580	and then dropped on the ground, I lay down and just kind of like, oh, and just like,
204580	208300	if you can in post, just repeat that like eight or nine times.
208300	210580	That's what I do.
210580	212980	You need to role play that.
212980	213980	Don't though.
213980	214980	Yeah, please don't.
215220	218260	I want to make my way to the front window and just look out.
218260	221180	Keith, Keith, you out there?
221180	222180	Hey.
222180	223180	Oh good.
223180	224180	It didn't take you.
224180	225180	I'm okay.
225180	230740	As you look out, the window is completely broken open and you know, some wind is hitting
230740	237660	the curtains and blowing them about and the cool night air is blowing in on your face
237660	243340	and you're now, after all of the adrenaline of the situation, you all are starting to
243340	249820	feel the extreme pain this metal man has put you through.
249820	250980	Ow!
250980	253780	That metal man put me through extreme pain.
253780	258300	Would first aid help me at all since I'm not like bleeding or anything, I'm just...
258300	263260	You're also just like laying in a yard so you don't really have anything with you.
263260	264260	That's true.
264260	268220	I want to pull my shirt off and try and first aid my arm with it.
268220	271140	All right, go ahead and roll first aid for me.
272140	273140	Uh, fail.
273140	274540	71 on a 30.
274540	275540	Okay.
275540	278140	So I just casually drape it over the blood.
278140	284340	I would like to pull off my cell phone and call the EMTs and have them roll first aid
284340	285340	on us.
285340	286780	That makes sense.
286780	292260	I'm going to get up on my feet out of the yard and try to, as quickly as I can, get
292260	293700	into the house or close to the house.
293700	299060	That way any falling debris doesn't hit me from the beautiful explosion that just happened
299060	300060	above me.
300060	301060	Absolutely.
301980	309540	I'm going to go inside and I see Clark attempting to do his arm up and I'm going to go up to
309540	313180	him, grab his shirt, and try to finish what he started.
316180	318180	I got a 31 on a 60 for first aid.
318180	320180	All right, roll a d4.
320180	321180	Pyramid.
323180	324180	Clark, you get three.
324180	325180	Three hit points back.
325180	327180	It's feeling better already.
327180	328180	Thank you.
328180	329180	Thank you.
329180	330180	You owe me.
330300	332980	That's what any a contention PD officer would do.
332980	333980	I would hope.
333980	336580	I feel like I'm at about seven health.
336580	340620	It's just barely above me, Clark.
340620	346180	And I start to laugh and then immediately my ribs just hurt and I lay on the ground.
346180	347180	John!
347180	349620	John, you okay?
349620	351180	He's like five feet away from you.
351180	352180	Oh.
352180	353180	No.
353180	354180	No.
354180	355180	What about you?
355180	356180	Keith, patch me up.
356180	357760	Keith, go see if you can help him.
357760	358760	Help me up.
361180	362180	Grab my left arm.
362180	364180	I use my good arm.
364180	367180	Guys, you can just stay there, the EMTs are coming.
367180	369280	Wait, what's wrong with you?
369280	371380	I was attacked by a giant metal man.
371380	372900	Yeah, I mean we all were.
372900	377100	What happened specifically to you so that I can first aid you and maybe get you a couple
377100	378260	hit points back?
378260	382220	He tried to pinch my ribs together, but a lucky surgical screw.
382260	390060	I believe there's actually still a hand, a metal hand halfway inside John Lee Pettymore's
390060	391060	side.
391060	395460	Yeah, so instead of answering, I just point to the metal hand sticking in on my side.
395460	398100	Can I tell, is it like broken the skin or is it like...
398100	399100	Yes.
399100	400100	There's a hand in me.
400100	401100	Okay.
401100	402100	Tried to make me its puppet.
402100	405780	I am going to attempt first aid on him as well.
405780	407820	I would like to wait for the EMTs.
407820	411620	Yeah, you should probably wait for the EMTs.
412620	417940	Keith, no offense man, but I want the professionals to remove this hand from my side.
417940	418940	That's yeah, I agree.
418940	422020	Yeah, I'm going to wait for them too because there's nothing.
422020	425100	I look down at my side, my just side is bruised.
425100	431020	I can walk, but it hurts to move my arms and to laugh, which is something I love doing.
431020	432020	Did you guys see a robot?
432020	433020	That was a robot.
433020	438680	I mean, I watched him fly up into the sky and explode like a beautiful firework.
438680	440620	So either he was a robot or...
440620	444980	I'm pretty good at his job as a firework technician.
444980	447340	Can you guys all roll sanity for me?
447340	450780	Ooh, I crit pass.
450780	451780	I crit pass.
451780	452780	Shit.
452780	457060	This isn't the first time I've confronted the terrifying truth about robots in our world.
457060	458060	Ooh, pass.
458060	459060	14.
459060	460060	I failed.
460060	461060	Okay.
461060	462060	Because I was first hand.
462060	463060	Saw it.
463060	464060	Clark, you lose.
464060	465060	No sanity.
465060	466060	I get it first hand.
466060	467060	Nice.
467060	468060	Right, John Lee?
468060	469060	First hand.
469060	470060	Yeah, I get it buddy.
470500	471900	I'm gonna lose one sanity.
471900	476220	And Keith, if you could roll a D6 and have it for me.
476220	477220	One.
477220	481740	I love fireworks, so I was more just stoked than scared.
481740	487260	Before the EMTs get over here, I do want to go sit down at that piano, play a little chopsticks.
487260	493620	When you walk over and sit down at the piano, you start playing it, but no sound comes out.
493620	498940	And when you kind of lean forward and looking inside, there are no strings inside this piano.
499020	501820	Can I do a search to see what I do see?
501820	502820	Yeah.
502820	506380	What do I see?
506380	508820	You see no strings inside the piano.
508820	510540	He rolled an 80 on his search.
510540	513060	You see the inside of a piano.
513060	514540	Is this a guitar?
514540	519860	So I want to stand up and I want to open the bench that I'm sitting on.
519860	521340	Ooh, nice.
521340	522580	As a piano player.
522580	526340	Yeah, I know a couple piano songs.
526340	529660	I saw Billy Joel and Elton John on tour.
529660	537300	There is sheet music for a song entitled The Rise of the End.
537300	540380	Can I put the sheet music up and attempt to play it?
540380	542180	Yeah, I'd do that.
542180	547540	You kind of remember reading music and you can kind of plunk around on this thing, but
547540	552660	it's honestly, it's really hard to play music when you can't hear the music.
552660	553820	Is there anything else in the bench?
553820	555500	No, it's just that one piece.
555540	559500	I want to hobble over to the coffee table and you mentioned there's a tube.
559500	560500	Yes.
560500	562500	I want to look at that tube.
562500	566620	Looking at the plastic tube, you see that there's a cap on one end that screws off.
566620	569420	I'm going to do that very slowly.
569420	570420	Okay.
570420	571820	Snakes pop out.
571820	572820	Exactly.
572820	577780	I thought it was peanuts.
577780	582100	Inside is just a rolled up paper, a bunch of paper that's all rolled up.
582100	585740	I want to unfurl it and glean what I can real quick.
585740	593260	When you unfurl it, you see these are blueprints for a place called Calm Comfy Campground.
593260	594260	Blueprints.
594260	601700	It looks like there is a large lake noted that it is called Lake Calm with an island
601700	602700	on it.
602700	604700	It's spelled with C's, right?
604700	605700	Yes.
606380	613700	On the island is one large building with six small buildings surrounding it.
613700	614700	Ew.
614700	615700	Ew.
615700	616700	Call back.
616700	617700	Comedy, right there.
617700	618700	No, it's mystery.
618700	619700	We're a mystery podcast.
619700	620700	They're very similar.
620700	621700	Yeah, this isn't funny.
621700	631900	We're not supposed to be funny, Luke, and many would say we're not.
631900	633660	I want to check on Randy Angst.
633660	634660	Okay.
634660	644180	As you go to the bathroom, you see an elderly man laying in the bathtub with a beautiful
644180	652060	three piece blue suit on his upper body and no clothes on his lower body.
652060	655260	Hey, Randy, did you poop those suit pants?
655260	664460	When you speak, he kind of like twitches and it smells vile in here and you can kind of
664460	667180	see that the bathtub is a bit dirty.
667180	675020	Yeah, Randy, I'd love to give you a hand, but listen, I think it's a good thing you're
675020	676020	in that bathtub, buddy.
676020	677900	We're going to scare you up another change of clothes.
677900	683620	Why don't you just get everything on you wet and scrub that all off and we'll talk in a
683620	684620	minute.
684620	685620	Okay?
685620	686620	Okay.
686620	687620	Does the water still work?
687620	690740	Did artillery shells take that out or just give that faucet?
690740	692020	Just try to wash the shit off yourself.
692020	693020	Oh, no.
693020	694020	It doesn't look like it.
694580	695580	It's getting hot very quickly.
695580	696580	Okay.
696580	697580	Well, there you go.
697580	698580	Hot shit water.
698580	699580	It smells great now.
699580	700580	The aroma.
700580	701580	Good luck, Randy.
701580	702580	I closed the door.
702580	703580	All right.
703580	705580	Maybe hit that fan on the way out.
705580	709940	When we first came in here, we just looked around the living room and then shit kind
709940	710940	of hit the fan.
710940	714620	I want to explore the house a little more and see if I can find any like specifically
714620	715620	an office.
715620	716620	Maybe.
716620	717620	Gotcha.
717620	722660	Was there a fan in Randy's pants because he shit his pants twice.
722820	723820	Oh, man.
723820	724820	Wow.
724820	725820	Yeah.
725820	726820	That was a weaving avenue.
726820	727820	Cut that out.
727820	728820	Yeah.
728820	729820	Whew.
729820	730820	Not a joke.
730820	736380	That was pretty good, guys.
736380	740420	You know, the last session was really good, so this makes sense.
740420	741420	Yeah, it's okay.
741420	745500	It's okay if this one sucks.
745500	751740	So walking around the rest of the house, it's a really nice house, but it's not that big.
751820	755820	It's only one story and there's no basement to it.
755820	758540	It's a two bedroom, two bath.
758540	760700	Everything is fucking immaculate.
760700	762540	This is an extremely clean house.
762540	770860	As you're going through stuff, it looks like James, who lived here, lived very minimalistically.
770860	775700	Except he's got a statue with a tuxedo and a suit of armor and a giant rose painting
775700	776700	and a piano.
776700	777700	Yeah.
777700	778700	He spent all of his money on nice things.
778700	781420	He didn't stand out starkly in contrast to his minimalized stuff.
781420	785820	He has no furniture, just impressive for us all right.
785820	786820	He was a collector.
786820	790740	Clark, I don't know if you've ever thought about getting into contention real estate,
790740	793580	but this place is now officially a fixer-upper.
793580	794580	The owner's dead.
794580	798620	We've got the estate agent in the bathtub with shit all over his pants.
798620	800620	I think we could negotiate a pretty good deal on this if you ever want to.
800620	802620	Yeah, all you got to do is rebuild the entire home.
802620	805180	Keith, I'm not trying to get in on ... I'm sorry, man.
805180	806460	I don't want to buy a house with you.
806460	808860	Clark, if you want to buy a house, man, I think we should look in on this.
808860	810020	You want to flip it with me?
810020	811020	I want to flip this, yeah.
811020	816620	I don't know how to ... I don't know anything about houses, so I don't find anything that
816620	818860	would pertain to maybe his work at the mill?
818860	819860	No, nothing.
819860	820860	Okay.
820860	821860	Yeah.
821860	826780	No, this is ... Honestly, it's pretty weird how bare and spartan the rest of this house
826780	827780	is.
827780	829540	I'm going to set fire to this fucking place.
829540	830540	You think so?
830540	832660	Not until we own it.
832660	835980	I was personally thinking when you guys were talking about flipping this house, John would
835980	837560	probably know how to fix it.
837560	844300	My guess is that Clark has a pretty dope savings account because he seems to not spend his
844300	845500	money on anything.
845500	846500	Yeah.
846500	847500	Yeah.
847500	852100	I come up, I'm like, guys, is this really what we want to be focusing on right now?
852100	853380	You're all bleeding everywhere.
853380	855300	I put my hands on my head.
855300	861600	John, I do distinctly remember you hours ago saying the only way to fix this situation
861600	862600	is to solve.
862600	864740	Hell yeah, man, but look where we are.
864740	866460	You got to keep your mind open to possibilities.
866460	868020	You just got to keep thinking.
868020	874380	Who is going to buy a house from two contingent PD officers if we don't solve this case?
874380	875380	Nobody.
875380	876380	All right.
876380	877740	That's the smartest thing you've ever said.
877740	878740	I agree.
878740	879740	I'm not a smart man.
879740	883580	I know what house flipping is.
883580	887940	That's where you're not ... You just turn it over, right?
887940	889420	It's like raising a barn.
889420	891940	It's like ... In reverse.
891940	894260	You know how you got to get tires rotated?
894260	897420	Raising a barn, not in reverse, but in a 90 degree angle.
897420	898420	House flipping, yeah.
898420	899420	You flip that on its own.
899420	903380	Actually, house flipping shows would be so much more fucking popular than they are if
903380	905100	they actually just flip the house, yeah.
905100	908180	Do you guys remember when you were a kid, you saw people move houses?
908180	909180	Did you ever see that?
909180	910180	Yeah, we moved houses.
910180	911180	When they moved it off.
911180	912180	Doing the big, yeah.
912180	913180	That's insane.
913180	914180	Yeah, where they get the foundation or whatever of.
914180	916980	How do they fucking do that, and why don't I see that more often these days?
916980	917980	I don't know.
917980	918980	I used to see it all the time.
918980	919980	I feel like I saw it a lot when I was a kid.
919980	924220	I feel like now it's just, I don't know, something about the bubble market, man.
924220	925220	The housing bubble, maybe.
925220	926220	Yeah, the market.
926220	930900	Oh, because they had a bubble around the houses, and now the housing bubble bubble popped,
930900	933860	and now you can't do that anymore, because if it falls off the trailer, the bubble can't
933860	934860	protect it.
934860	935860	The bubble can't protect it.
935860	936860	You're right.
936860	937860	That's it.
937860	941060	When I was a kid, I used to always think in any room that I was in, how I would leave
941060	943780	that room if the room was upside down.
943780	944780	Oh, cool.
944780	945780	That's fun.
945780	948180	That's dope.
948180	949180	Through the door.
949180	950180	Yeah.
950180	951180	Yeah.
952180	956900	It's almost always a doorway.
956900	957900	It's like-
957900	961580	We all stop to look around the room we're in, and it's just like, oh, you just have
961580	963100	to reach up a little bit higher for the doorknob.
963100	966380	Higher for the doorknob, and then step over the exit of the doorway.
966380	970940	If you're like a five or six year old, you could probably reach that.
970940	971940	It would be a leap.
971940	972940	If you were in a foyer, too.
972940	973940	Oh, yeah.
973940	974940	Yeah, sure.
974940	975940	You've got a taller ceiling going up.
975940	976940	You'd be screwing a McMansion.
976940	977940	Yeah.
978700	981700	I love to talk about those weird high ceilings in McMansions and how pointless they are.
981700	983700	Love tall ceilings.
983700	986380	By the way, the ceilings in this house, very tall.
986380	987380	Yeah, but they-
987380	988380	No, no, no.
988380	989380	Not the house we're in.
989380	990380	The house you're in.
990380	991380	Oh.
991380	992380	Ew, gross.
992380	993380	The house you're in.
993380	995380	The house always you're in.
995380	997380	Oh, that's why the walls are wet.
997380	998380	Okay.
998380	1001860	Hey, did I show you guys what was in that hole over there that I fell into?
1001860	1002860	No.
1002860	1003860	Oh, yeah.
1003860	1004860	No.
1004860	1005860	What is it?
1005860	1006860	Also, are your legs okay?
1006860	1007860	Did you break your leg or something?
1008780	1010780	No, I actually landed with cat-like agility.
1010780	1011780	Wow.
1011780	1013060	No, but what was down there?
1013060	1014060	Was it like-
1014060	1015060	There's two dead people down there.
1015060	1016060	Oh.
1016060	1017060	Oh.
1017060	1018540	How dead are they?
1018540	1019540	Yeah.
1019540	1020540	How dead were they?
1020540	1021540	Were they decayed?
1021540	1024660	They looked to be maybe a week or two old.
1024660	1026660	They're a little musty.
1026660	1029420	I mean, they're not infants, sorry.
1029420	1030420	No, no.
1030420	1031420	I know what you mean.
1031420	1032420	Yeah, we knew what you meant.
1032420	1033420	Okay, cool.
1033980	1039860	The all prevailing and inescapable odor of the dead did pervade throughout the house
1039860	1043140	when you fell through that hole, but I just assumed, you know, it was Randy.
1043140	1049060	Wait, so do you think James kept those people down there or do you think-
1049060	1052260	It looks like they fell into the armor trap, right?
1052260	1053260	Could they have died from that fall?
1053260	1054900	You said it was 12 feet, right?
1054900	1056140	Do you die from a 12 feet drop?
1056140	1057140	I don't think you die.
1057140	1059140	Well, you break your legs and if you're down in a pit-
1059140	1060140	And then you can't get out, sure.
1060140	1062300	But you don't die from falling 12 feet.
1062300	1063300	Sure.
1064180	1065180	You could if you were upside down or something.
1065180	1066180	He just didn't let them out.
1066180	1067180	Yeah.
1067180	1071940	Well, so that's what I'm thinking is, do you think James could be some kind of crazy H.H.
1071940	1073180	Holmes killer?
1073180	1078220	Well, so I fell down there and then all hell broke loose, but I used my steely cool to
1078220	1081060	go through the pockets before I tried to get myself out of there.
1081060	1082060	I do.
1082060	1083060	I really get a more, um-
1083060	1084060	Hold on.
1084060	1085060	Can I get Ramona out of here?
1085060	1092060	Ramona, Ramona, let me hold you while you're going in here, baby.
1092300	1094300	Damn, your house is clean.
1094300	1096020	Yeah, it is, dude.
1096020	1097020	Not this room.
1097020	1099260	Fucking my man cave.
1099260	1101500	More like a man's grave.
1101500	1102500	Whoa.
1102500	1107000	This man cave is more like a man's grave.
1107000	1108000	So I found a subreddit-
1108000	1109000	I forgot all about that.
1109000	1114620	I found a subreddit called man caves and every number one post is somebody doing more like
1114620	1115620	a man's grave.
1115620	1116620	Doing more like a man's grave.
1116620	1117620	Yeah.
1117620	1118620	That's incredible.
1118620	1119620	Fuck.
1119620	1120620	That is shit.
1121260	1124980	So yeah, I went through the pockets down there on those bodies and they had one of those
1124980	1126360	symbols in their pockets.
1126360	1128380	It's the circle with the circle surrounding it.
1128380	1129820	The six around them, yeah.
1129820	1132580	Just like these blueprints over here that you also found.
1132580	1133820	You're right.
1133820	1141620	That lake has an island on it with a building in that same configuration.
1141620	1144300	I think it's a clue, boys.
1144300	1145780	Smells like a clue.
1146780	1150220	Wait, where was the CCC?
1150220	1152220	I feed Clark a Scooby Sniff.
1152220	1153220	Where was the CCC?
1153220	1155020	Does anybody know where that is?
1155020	1156020	Oh.
1156020	1157020	Randy might.
1157020	1159980	Yeah, I take the blueprints back to the bathroom and like-
1159980	1162980	Hey Randy buddy.
1162980	1165240	You getting cleaned up in there?
1165240	1171860	Warm water is pouring out from underneath the door and it has a slight color to it and
1171860	1173300	it smells just awful.
1173300	1175980	Randy, I notice there's a lot of shit water out here.
1175980	1177540	You doing okay in there, buddy?
1177540	1179540	The drain is clogged.
1179540	1184140	Okay, why don't you just try to rub your hand over it and get some of that shit out of the
1184140	1185140	holes, you know?
1185140	1186580	I'm trying to stomp it down.
1186580	1188380	Oh no, that's the opposite.
1188380	1190180	Do you have any- Okay, listen.
1190180	1191180	Don't worry about that.
1191180	1194020	Do you know about the- What was it called?
1194020	1195020	CCC.
1195020	1196620	Calm Comfy Campgrounds.
1196620	1199780	Do you know where the Calm Comfy Campgrounds are?
1199780	1200780	No.
1200780	1202460	Okay, well thanks for your help, buddy.
1202460	1203460	No problem.
1203460	1204460	Thanks for coming and checking on me.
1204460	1206380	Can I get some pants?
1206380	1209500	Why don't you figure out this- Yeah, we'll get you pants, but it really doesn't seem
1209500	1213460	like you're at pants stage yet if you're still at drain shit stomping stage.
1213460	1216520	The water is no longer- We're definitely not getting you socks.
1216520	1220620	The water is no longer running.
1220620	1227180	And you just hear this like- You just doubling down on that stomping, huh?
1227180	1228180	I'm trying.
1228180	1231900	Okay, well, yeah, just keep that up, I guess.
1231900	1235300	All right, well hey guys, yeah, he didn't know anything about that.
1235300	1236620	What is that smell?
1236620	1240140	Oh yeah, that's all the shit water Randy got everywhere.
1240140	1241140	Probably the corpses too.
1241140	1242500	Oh yeah, that makes sense.
1242500	1248100	You look down in the pit, yeah, these two bodies, very, very super dead, skin is already
1248100	1250660	turned, you know, whatever color.
1250660	1254500	Hey guys, is there anything else in this house you want to look at, otherwise I'm gonna go
1254500	1258940	outside and wait for the ambulance, because I think I'm gonna throw up, and I feel like
1258940	1261940	if I throw up, the pain from my ribs is gonna make me throw up.
1261940	1265300	Yeah, there's also already a lot of shit water in here, so if you could not throw up on our
1265300	1270380	new house, that would be- I go out in the front yard and just sit down
1270380	1271380	on the ground.
1271380	1276660	The ambulance is coming down the street and pulls into the driveway, which is not where
1276660	1280220	your cruiser is, because your cruiser is in the yard.
1280220	1281420	Correct, I might know.
1281420	1282860	The cool way to park.
1282860	1285780	When I see the ambulance pull up, I'm probably heading out too.
1285780	1287220	I'm in a lot of pain.
1287220	1293380	I stand up and I wave with my left hand, because I assume my right side got hit, yeah, I wave
1293380	1297900	and call the EMT guys over, and I put them in Clark's direction because I feel like he
1297900	1300180	has the biggest injury.
1300180	1303740	I got a sloppy arm, folks, I say to the paramedics as they walk up.
1303740	1305540	Oh my god, that's incredible.
1305540	1307780	It hurts real bad too.
1307780	1309340	What happened tonight, guys?
1309340	1310340	This is crazy.
1310340	1312220	Are you related to Drew?
1312220	1315820	No, you've asked me that before.
1315820	1317580	This is just what I sound like.
1317580	1324500	I talk to the paramedic, I'm like, pretty good tourniquet on his arm, huh?
1324500	1325500	No.
1325500	1330020	It made me feel better, Keith, don't worry.
1330020	1331020	We'll get him next time, buddy.
1331020	1335660	I just look down at the ground and I just wait for my turn to get treated.
1335660	1340620	We'd love to tell you all about the weird robot shenanigans that happened here, but
1340620	1341620	we need help.
1342020	1343020	What?
1343020	1344020	We'd love to tell you about him.
1344020	1348940	Yeah, don't listen to him, he's just screwing with you, just help us, just help us.
1348940	1354180	I look at the guy and I kind of eyeball down to the robot hand still stuck in me, and I'm
1354180	1355180	like, hmm?
1355180	1361620	He looks at it and he's like, uh, yeah, okay, we can definitely take care of all three of
1361620	1362940	you at the same time.
1362940	1368260	Cool, what should we roll to make that happen?
1368260	1370140	I take three healing potions.
1370140	1376460	Yeah, I actually have a Phoenix down, so I kill myself and then put that on me and I'm
1376460	1378740	back to full health.
1378740	1379740	Final Fantasy.
1379740	1383660	Hey, folks out there, you ever play Final Fantasy?
1383660	1385940	That was a Final Fantasy joke.
1385940	1389180	I win 95.
1389180	1392060	Jon is going to regain three hit points.
1392060	1393060	Yay.
1393060	1394260	I'm at 12.
1394260	1396380	Keith regains one hit point.
1396380	1397580	God dammit.
1397580	1399740	And Clark regains four hit points.
1399740	1400740	Nice.
1400740	1406780	Um, can I ask them for some of their hit points since I did give them some, well, I gave you
1406780	1407780	four back, huh?
1407780	1408780	I'm just kidding.
1408780	1412620	Just kidding, I'm good with six hit points.
1412620	1414620	I'll just be careful.
1414620	1415620	I'm at 11.
1415620	1418620	I'm at, I already said, but I'm at 12.
1418620	1423100	Okay, boys, what are we going to do next?
1423100	1425060	We've explored the tuxedo statue.
1425060	1427180	Did we check out the painting yet?
1427220	1428220	Yeah, we checked out the painting.
1428220	1432020	Remember it had all the, uh, we bonded over the bomb making.
1432020	1433020	That's right.
1433020	1435940	Oh, do you fellas remember, uh, there was some blood writing in there.
1435940	1438180	It said, stop her.
1438180	1439580	Who do you guys think her is?
1439580	1440580	Who wrote it even?
1440580	1441900	Do you guys have forensics at all?
1441900	1442900	Yeah, but not much.
1442900	1443900	I have 40.
1443900	1446000	I got 50.
1446000	1451620	We should maybe like swab that DNA, the blood and see if it's anybody.
1451620	1457040	If we can like stick it into the database and see if it's DNA that pops up of anybody
1457040	1458040	that's yeah.
1458040	1459040	I want to do that.
1459040	1461440	I want to run in there and take a sample of the blood that says, stop her.
1461440	1462440	Okay.
1462440	1463440	Do I need to roll for that?
1463440	1466560	Cause that just basically, I just want to put it in.
1466560	1467560	That's very easy.
1467560	1468560	Yeah.
1468560	1470760	I'd like to research the piano, I guess.
1470760	1473680	How 33, what are you doing?
1473680	1476920	I am, um, re searching, researching that.
1476920	1482120	So I go into the, um, the inside where all the strings would be and I'm just feeling
1482120	1484520	around for like loose keys.
1484520	1485740	I run my hands over the keys.
1485740	1489300	I'm just kind of checking everything again thoroughly, but this time I did get a crit
1489300	1490300	success.
1490300	1491300	33.
1491300	1492300	You did indeed.
1492300	1499440	And as you are looking through the empty piano, you would make note of the fact that there
1499440	1506380	were piano strings in here at a certain point in time.
1506380	1511320	However, those strings are no longer here.
1511320	1512320	By God.
1512320	1514540	Boys, I don't know what it means, but.
1514540	1523420	And in one small corner now, dammit, uh, were there any other pieces in here?
1523420	1525520	We got the painting of a Rose.
1525520	1528540	We looked at, okay, we got tuxedo suit, man.
1528540	1529540	We got suit of armor.
1529540	1531420	Did we search the tuxedo?
1531420	1537060	The tic, the tuxedo statue was the bow tie that moved, that popped up the look at the
1537060	1538060	pockets though.
1538060	1540020	Might as well run a hand through.
1540020	1541020	It's a statue.
1541020	1542020	It was a statue.
1542500	1544480	I was picturing a tuxedo on a statue.
1544480	1548260	It was a guy in a tuxedo statue.
1548260	1549260	That's gaudy.
1549260	1550640	Oh yeah.
1550640	1552180	All this shit is horrible.
1552180	1554180	He's got the rose paint.
1554180	1555180	Wait, hold on.
1555180	1556460	Yeah, let's try his glasses.
1556460	1559740	Bow tie that moved, Rose painting.
1559740	1562980	It was a hard hat on the suit of armor.
1562980	1567460	If you remember what present I acted like I got cook.
1567460	1571380	It had those things and it had a Rose, it had a hard hat and it had a, was it a bow
1571420	1572420	tie in the package?
1572420	1573420	It was indeed.
1573420	1575060	A silk bow tie.
1575060	1577700	Do you think the package came from James?
1577700	1578820	I'm thinking this.
1578820	1582240	We found James dead with Maggie cook.
1582240	1585220	She got a gift box with those things in it.
1585220	1589860	We are at James's house with two dead bodies and a 12 foot pit.
1589860	1592380	I forgot that she was with him when she died.
1592380	1595060	Having some kind of foot feast.
1595060	1597100	It's probably just a coincidence.
1597100	1602980	I wonder if there's a connection between Maggie and James other than her dad working
1602980	1604220	at the mill and him working at the mill.
1604220	1606220	I wonder if they knew each other before all this.
1606220	1612220	Guys, I think it's pretty clear this is all just one big coincidence.
1612220	1613540	So I mean, what do you think?
1613540	1621140	I mean, that is the mysterious present that I took credit for, which you know was a lie,
1621140	1622140	right?
1622140	1623140	You know, by this time.
1623140	1624140	My eyes narrow.
1624140	1625140	It's like a key.
1625180	1627060	I go to my gun.
1627060	1632140	By this time, you know that I'm an incompetent fool, which I would never say if it didn't
1632140	1633140	benefit me.
1633140	1636580	It's the perfect cover, though, for a criminal mastermind.
1636580	1638300	Okay, so how?
1638300	1642180	We put together the pieces of a puzzle that we don't know what the puzzle was.
1642180	1644020	Why would he have sent this stuff?
1644020	1645820	I think we need to go to the mill.
1645820	1646820	I think the mill's a really good place to go.
1646820	1649020	I think we need to go to the mill and interview some people.
1649020	1652300	I feel like we've been trying to go to the mill for half our lives.
1652300	1653900	I think we need to go to the mill.
1653900	1654900	Mighty Ducks on three.
1654900	1655900	One, two, three.
1655900	1656900	Mighty Ducks.
1656900	1657900	Mighty Ducks.
1657900	1658900	Is it quack?
1658900	1659900	It's quack.
1659900	1660900	It's quack.
1660900	1661900	That's super not what they did in that movie, guys.
1661900	1662900	I know.
1662900	1663900	I used to do that.
1663900	1664900	That's my fault.
1664900	1667500	Mighty Ducks on three.
1667500	1672100	So looking around this house, do you want to make sure that it's, you know, is it a
1672100	1673100	crime scene?
1673100	1674100	What are you doing?
1674100	1678140	Well, obviously it's a crime scene, but I don't think that the public needs to know
1678140	1679140	about a...
1679140	1680580	Two more disappeared bodies.
1680580	1684780	I don't think the public needs to know about an artillery-shelled robot.
1684780	1687540	Yeah, I bet a few people do though.
1687540	1691060	We should get that handbag from those paramedics, run some tests on that bad boy.
1691060	1692060	The handbag?
1692060	1693060	The handbag.
1693060	1694060	The handbag, yeah.
1694060	1697260	Hey, a guy who claims he's not related to Drew.
1697260	1698260	What's your name, buddy?
1698260	1699260	I'm the EMT.
1699260	1700260	Sweet.
1700260	1701980	Hey, can I have that robot hand?
1701980	1702980	Yeah, absolutely.
1702980	1703980	Thanks, man.
1703980	1705420	Hey, Mr. EMT.
1705420	1706420	There's a...
1706420	1707420	Emmett.
1707420	1708420	I'm Emmett, the EMT.
1708420	1709420	Hey, Emmett.
1710420	1712860	We've got a crime scene here.
1712860	1716500	We've got a couple bodies at the bottom of a pit that we can't get out of.
1716500	1721780	Could you send some guys with ropes to pull those up for us and get them over to the corner?
1721780	1726300	Yeah, I'll call the rope ambulance and they'll be right over.
1726300	1727300	You're good people, Emmett.
1727300	1729940	I'm gonna set up some caution tape all around this scene.
1729940	1731180	You make sure nobody else gets in here.
1731180	1732180	Yeah, hey, Emmett.
1732180	1734220	Will you just keep an eye on things?
1734220	1737340	Listen, we're deputizing you.
1737340	1738580	Does that sound cool?
1738580	1740300	Actually, I'd like to not be...
1740300	1741300	Too late, buddy.
1741300	1743540	And I'll pin a little Sheriff's Star sticker.
1743540	1745540	Let's just get Florence over here to...
1745540	1746540	Who?
1746540	1747540	Flo.
1747540	1748540	Florence?
1748540	1749540	Florence.
1749540	1750540	Yeah.
1750540	1751540	Sure.
1751540	1755700	Let's get Flo over here to patrol until we tell her not to.
1755700	1756700	Sounds good.
1756700	1760020	So you're calling Florence directly or...
1760020	1762580	Bring, bring, bring, bring.
1762580	1763580	She doesn't answer.
1763580	1764580	I'll send her a text.
1764580	1765580	Damn it.
1765580	1769540	Drew, tell them to relay the info to Florence.
1769540	1770540	Sounds good.
1770540	1771540	Yeah, it's not gonna happen.
1771540	1776340	Hey, Drew, what's the deal with your cousin, Emmett?
1776340	1779020	What?
1779020	1791620	Ever since he got gum surgery, he just thinks he's better than me.
1791620	1792660	I know who that goes, man.
1792660	1794660	I got some cousins.
1794660	1795660	It's like, we get it.
1795660	1797380	You're pretty now.
1797380	1802060	I do legitimately want to set up a caution tape over the perimeter of the yard, and then
1802060	1803900	even over the doors and the windows and stuff.
1803900	1807660	And maybe we could set up some kind of scarecrow cop in the window.
1807660	1813340	We'll put the tuxedo statue up in a window and put a little badge.
1813340	1819340	I'm thinking if Florence isn't answering our shit, I would like to have some sort of surveillance
1819340	1820340	here.
1820340	1821340	I don't know how we could do that.
1821340	1822340	Somebody could leave their cell phone.
1822340	1823340	Oh, no.
1823340	1831340	I do have a GoPro that streams to my phone that I could just tape up on a wall.
1831340	1832340	Do it.
1832340	1837620	I go to my cruiser, and I'm hoping that my other two officers aren't looking at me.
1837620	1841500	And I open up the trunk, and I look around, and I open up.
1841500	1846300	My trunk has a false bottom that the spare tire goes in, but I don't have a spare tire
1846300	1847300	in there.
1847300	1848300	I just have a bunch of snacks.
1848300	1855020	And then I have a GoPro in there, and I close it.
1855020	1859420	So I get the GoPro, and I tape it.
1859420	1864100	Where is the statue, the suit of armor?
1864100	1865100	Is that in the foyer?
1865100	1866420	Those are both in the foyer.
1866420	1870540	Kind of above and to the right of both of those, I put it up in the corner, and I tape
1870540	1874100	it up there, and I have it feeding to my phone.
1874100	1875100	Sweet.
1875100	1876100	Done.
1876100	1881340	And I'm kind of sad, because I was going to do some cool ... I've been trying to learn
1881340	1887660	how to skateboard, so I've been putting it on my helmet while I skateboard, but none
1887660	1891620	of the footage is useful, because I'm not very good at skateboarding, so.
1891620	1896820	I think that footage could be useful.
1896820	1898860	I'm going to go check on Randy again.
1898860	1900860	I'm going to say, hey, buddy.
1900860	1901860	Listen.
1901860	1902860	Splash, splash.
1902860	1903860	I was thinking about you.
1903860	1904860	Hey, man.
1904860	1907580	You know, it's all about keeping that attitude positive.
1907580	1912100	The door flings open, and steam starts just pouring out of this room.
1912100	1913740	Oh, you're enjoying this now.
1913740	1916460	Well, I guess it's good that I caught you in a good mood, because hey, it does seem
1916460	1921900	to me like the estate has a real fixer-upper on their hands, and I'd be willing to take
1921900	1924780	this off your hands pretty cheap.
1924780	1926700	We can talk about that later.
1926700	1928700	Glad you got the shit taken care of.
1928700	1929700	Here's some pants.
1929700	1930700	Hey, buddy.
1930700	1931700	I need you to do me a big favor.
1931700	1933340	Why'd you get sweatpants?
1933340	1934820	So you could shit them again easily?
1934820	1935820	Okay, you know what?
1935820	1936820	That all adds up.
1936820	1937820	So, hey.
1937820	1941940	We're going to send an officer over here, but we really got to get going, so please
1941940	1947180	don't sell anything in the next seven hours or whatever, and could you just keep an eye
1947180	1954340	on things for like 30 minutes, and hey, here's my card, and if any robots come back, do let
1954340	1955340	us know immediately.
1955340	1956340	Any?
1956340	1957340	Oh, God.
1957340	1958340	Okay.
1958340	1963420	Officer of Contingent, the Contingent PD will be here to relieve you, uh, presently, but-
1963420	1964420	Presently?
1964420	1965780	Yeah, that means soon.
1965780	1969540	But don't relieve yourself presently again, Randy.
1969540	1973300	All right, well, thank you, Officer Pettymore.
1973300	1975460	Yeah, uh, no problem, Mr. Anx.
1975460	1983700	And he walks out and into the living room, and he points at the legs with the pelvic
1983700	1986100	area, standing-
1986100	1988620	What?
1988620	1989620	Standing on the ground.
1989620	1990620	Oh, yeah.
1990620	1993820	And, uh, he just kind of points at them.
1993820	1996900	Yeah, man, we kicked a robot's ass.
1996900	1998460	That's all the commotion.
1998460	2003420	He just, uh, he just sits down on the couch, all right, and just pulls out his phone.
2003420	2007780	I want to go through the pockets of that robot's legs that I forgot were in the middle of this
2007780	2008780	room.
2008780	2013020	Yeah, I would like to thoroughly examine the robot legs for markings or manufacturers.
2013420	2015820	Maybe even look inside the wiring and sit there in the air.
2015820	2017820	I also want to check out his robot dick.
2017820	2018820	Yeah.
2018820	2019820	What's he got?
2019820	2027060	Okay, when you go through the pockets of his, like, tactical pants, you find a couple knives,
2027060	2034320	a bunch of ammo for the weapon he was using earlier, and that's it.
2034320	2037140	That's all that's in the pants.
2037140	2045580	John unbuttons those pants, unzips those pants, and starts bringing those trousers
2045580	2057420	to the ground, and there is, hanging between the mechanical legs of this thing, it's a
2057420	2058420	real penis.
2058420	2059420	Look at that, boys.
2059420	2061820	Okay, so hold on.
2061820	2062820	I was not expecting-
2062820	2066620	I was hoping for, like, a key to the end of the game.
2067100	2070340	I thought it was going to be, like, John Peter's face stares back at you.
2070340	2071340	Yeah, right.
2071340	2074780	You see his dick, and branded on it is, a fool.
2074780	2078620	It's his dick, but there's a green light on it.
2078620	2083580	Weird tubes extend from the shaft.
2083580	2090940	Okay, so when you take his pants down to the ground, he is smooth like a Ken doll.
2090940	2101300	However, on the penis spot, the spot where a penis and balls would be, there is a little
2101300	2109860	symbol etched into the metal, and it is an M, the letter M, as in Mancy, made of four
2109860	2112300	double helices.
2112300	2118700	I would like to do a reverse image search on that logo.
2118700	2120060	Okay.
2120060	2121060	Full luck.
2121060	2122060	No dice.
2122060	2124060	76 on a 45.
2124060	2125060	Okay.
2125060	2127420	If I look at it, do I- does it ring any bells for Clark?
2127420	2128420	Nope.
2128420	2132780	Can we get Drew to come down here and take those legs to evidence?
2132780	2134580	That sounds like a flow job.
2134580	2135580	No, we won't-
2135580	2136580	Flow job.
2136580	2137580	I think we won't-
2137580	2138580	Flow's coming down here, but eventually she'll leave, so she'll take the legs with her.
2138580	2140420	Well, we haven't gotten in contact with Flow.
2140420	2142660	I contacted Drew to get in contact with Flow.
2142660	2144380	I want Flow to stay here.
2144380	2147900	I think we should have Drew come down here, take the legs back to evidence.
2147900	2149300	But then they're just sitting in a room.
2149460	2151340	It's not like Drew can do anything with them there.
2151340	2153580	Yeah, but we can do with them at some point.
2153580	2154580	I'm with you.
2154580	2155580	I think we should do that.
2155580	2157940	If they stay here, then they're just going to go by the wayside.
2157940	2161740	There's three of you and one police cruiser, so you can take them with you if you want.
2161740	2162740	Yeah, we can just take them.
2162740	2163740	Ooh, let's take the robot legs.
2163740	2166620	Yeah, but I feel like if we take the robot legs with us, they're going to attack us
2166620	2167620	at some point.
2167620	2168620	Then we can get them at a jump point.
2168620	2169620	And-
2169620	2170620	No, let's take them.
2170620	2171620	We might be able to figure out a way to ride them.
2171620	2172620	Scarecrow cap.
2172620	2178820	Well, it's two against one, so all in favor of having Drew take them back to evidence,
2178820	2179820	say aye.
2179820	2180820	Aye.
2180820	2181820	Aye.
2181820	2185260	All in favor of taking them with us to the mill.
2185260	2186260	Aye.
2186260	2187260	Aye.
2187260	2188260	Okay, so I-
2188260	2191900	It's cute that you think this is a democracy, Keith.
2191900	2192900	I-
2192900	2194780	We'll throw them in the trunk there, Keith.
2194780	2195780	That way they can't get to them.
2195780	2196780	We'll take real good care of them, buddy.
2196780	2198900	Yeah, we'll throw them in the trunk of my cruiser.
2198900	2199900	Great, guys.
2199900	2200900	Okay, well-
2200900	2204060	What, are you afraid they'll ruin your snacks?
2204060	2205900	You don't know that I have snacks in there.
2205900	2207620	We know about your snacks, buddy.
2207620	2211500	I sit down on the ground, I'm like, you guys can do whatever you want to do.
2211500	2215220	Apparently this isn't a democracy, so I'll just do whatever you guys want to do.
2215220	2218220	Why'd you say it like that?
2218220	2219220	He's mad.
2219220	2220220	Keith is angry.
2220220	2230700	I will stand up when we go to the mill, but I'm driving my fucking car.
2230700	2232100	He's got the best drive.
2232100	2233100	Me.
2233100	2234660	I have 40 drive.
2234660	2235660	70.
2235700	2237900	Yeah, well, it's my car, so I'm driving.
2237900	2242620	Actually, I don't sit down on the ground, I go sit in the driver's seat of my car and
2242620	2244020	wait for the other two officers.
2244020	2246860	John, you want to help me lug this into the trunk?
2246860	2249580	No, but sure.
2249580	2253180	Yeah, we lift it and carry it over to the trunk.
2253180	2255820	Oh, that makes the ribs sore.
2255820	2256820	Right before they get-
2256820	2257820	Oh, yeah.
2257820	2259500	Right before they get to my car-
2259500	2260500	I don't think I can carry it.
2260500	2261500	Taking one arm.
2261500	2262500	One arm.
2262500	2265440	Yeah, I get to the ankles underneath the armpit there.
2265440	2270920	Right before they get to my car, I do the lock, unlock game with them.
2270920	2274480	I lock the trunk right before they try to open it.
2274480	2279880	I fire my gun into the air several times.
2279880	2282080	Keith, do not play this shit with me today.
2282080	2285800	You hear from inside the house, oh, no.
2285800	2288840	Sorry, Randy.
2288840	2294080	I hear the gun shoot off, I'm like, ah, I don't want to test it, so I unlock it and
2294080	2295080	then-
2295120	2296120	Oh, I put the legs in the trunk.
2296120	2299560	No, I lock it right before they open it.
2299560	2302080	I'm laughing, but it hurts.
2302080	2306840	The first time I do it, it hurts my ribs to laugh, so I just unlock it because I'm like,
2306840	2307840	I can't keep doing this.
2307840	2309720	It'll be too funny.
2309720	2310720	So it's unlocked.
2316720	2317720	I open it.
2317720	2319720	And then I lock it right before.
2319720	2322360	No, it's unlocked.
2322360	2329240	At this point, I'm just like hurting and tired and mad.
2329240	2331240	Delta Green.
2352360	2354360	Why you do?
2354360	2366360	Oh, how can you have enough drowning out of the noise?
2366360	2370360	With no mind at all.
2370360	2374360	No mind at all.
2374360	2378360	No mind at all.
2378360	2380360	Fight, fight.
2380360	2382360	Stream it out.
