0	6520	What's up my babies, it's your grease daddy Wolf the Dog, and I'm here absorbing all
6520	11220	the oil from all the deep fryers here in contention.
11220	17200	The grease used here in the past is much better than the grease used in the present and the
17200	18280	future.
18280	26620	So light a match and watch me explode baby, it's 694.2 PTBP and I'm here to ignite
26620	31900	your passion for local news and other happenings from the past.
31900	36620	Speaking of happenings, we got ourselves a new Howlin' with Wolf.
36620	41780	This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from At Crafty Under Dash Creep, who tagged at
41780	44500	Pretending Pod in an Instagram post.
44500	48940	They write, I would love to howl at my love bug Alec.
48940	53860	Thanks for turning me on to the best podcast and being the best partner ever.
54100	59620	Well crafty creep, I don't got much intimidating to say to you and your loved one.
59620	64860	It brings some joy to my small grease filled heart to hear about y'all.
64860	68380	I wish someone would howl at me in a loving manner.
68380	73300	Maybe one day, maybe someday, maybe someday.

116660	119880	You might not know, but Wolf has kids to feed.
119880	125100	How else am I going to fatten them up before I feast upon them?
125100	129700	The news is meant to be a time to remind our listeners of the past.
129700	134740	So you might not have to send your minds on such a difficult journey when remembering
134740	137640	all the nonsense that has gone on so far.
137680	143600	Now, if I pick and pull what I remember from my time in current day contention, it might
143600	148720	spoil some of the sweet niblets that are being served up in this story.
148720	151360	This fresh, fresh story.
151360	157160	We may be in the past, but I've seen the future and I know the best possible present
157160	163000	is Moondance by Blue False Indigo.
163000	169940	She runs, she runs, she runs, ooh.
174420	182720	The sun, the sun, the sun is leaving soon.
182720	200920	She knows, she knows, she knows that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance
200920	206920	beneath the shadow of the moon.
206920	216760	So Joe, I'm going to game four of the, uh, was it NLDS?
216760	219560	Uh, yeah, uh, shit.
219560	220560	Is it DS and NCS?
220560	222040	Yeah, I think it is.
222040	226260	Uh, going to game four, uh, which is in St. Louis.
226260	227260	Fuck yeah, dude.
227260	228260	Holy shit.
228260	229920	Yeah, I'm super, super stoked.
229920	236240	My dad is turning 60 on that day and so my brother and I are taking him to that game
236560	237560	for his birthday.
237560	238560	Lucky.
238560	239560	Yeah, it's going to be dope.
239560	240560	That's super dope.
240560	242800	Somebody I know was doing one of the Atlanta games.
242800	245080	Oh, I'd love to go back to Atlanta.
245080	252120	I've only been once and it was when I was like 17, 18 years old and I was there with
252120	260900	my brother and my dad and a bunch of church people for a Christian conference and we,
260900	269440	this was at the end of my tenure in the church and during the candlelight vigil, the silent
269440	275140	candlelight thing, my brother and I skipped out on it to get extremely drunk at the hotel.
275140	276140	Like you do.
276140	280820	We, uh, there was a college basketball game on and we bought a really cheap bottle of
280820	288140	bourbon and we played a game where we each chose a team and then every time the team
288140	290740	scored, you had to do a shot.
290740	291740	A score?
291740	292740	Yeah.
292740	293740	What?
293740	294740	I was 17.
294740	301300	He was 21 and we were children in monsters and we got so drunk.
301300	303380	That was the night he died of alcohol poisoning.
303380	304380	Oh yeah.
304380	305380	Yeah.
305380	306380	Rip.
306380	310820	Um, we're taking his corpse to game four.
310820	311820	Pretty cool.
311820	313220	My ghost brother to buy us tickets.
313220	318140	Uh, so we, we get really drunk and then we change into our swimming trunks.
318140	323060	You got into like four shots in and then it was like, oh, nevermind.
323060	324060	Uh, yeah.
324060	329100	We even made a thing where it was like, and on turnovers and dunks you take two shots
329100	334260	cause we're idiots and thankfully I don't drink like that anymore, but we're very drunk
334260	339740	in our swimsuits in downtown Atlanta and the pool was closed.
339740	342460	So we went to the weight room and maxed out on bench.
342460	344460	This is standard stuff.
344460	345460	Yeah.
345460	349420	And then we went outside for me to go smoke a cigarette right after doing that because
349420	357100	again, I was a monster and uh, and so we're outside and this dude comes up to us and he's
357100	360580	like, Hey, Hey, you guys have any money?
360580	362700	And we were like, no, no, not at all.
362700	368780	But uh, and like we pull out this bourbon from our bag, we brought it with us outside
368820	370740	and we're like, you want to get drunk with us?
370740	372300	His name was Orestes.
372300	373300	Orestes.
373300	376780	Yeah, he's, he's, he was so funny.
376780	380660	And then we, uh, we talked with him for a long time before we decided we'd walk around
380660	386340	downtown, but we walked directly into the candlelight vigil that was happening from.
386340	387340	Oh my God.
387340	388340	The thing you were supposed to be at.
388340	391340	The thing we were supposed to be at.
391340	392980	That's great.
392980	397980	Just drunkenly in our swimsuits, just like drunkenly wandering through this crowd of
398940	403460	and hoping desperately not to run into our dad who's hopefully not listening to this
403460	404460	podcast.
404460	405460	All right.
407460	409460	Ken Krinklehoff.
409460	410460	That's me.
410460	411460	How do you spell Krinklehoff, Joe?
411460	412460	Oh boy.
412460	417460	It's a C R I N K L E H O F F.
417460	418460	Cool.
418460	419460	That works for me.
419460	420460	Yeah.
420460	422460	The professor's name is, he, he spells it a little different.
422460	423460	P H.
423460	424460	Sure.
424940	429140	You are heading to the woods in your mom's minivan.
429140	434820	She's driving you there because Ken, I just don't understand why you have to, why you
434820	439660	have to continue to do this, this yearly trip out into the woods.
439660	444380	Ken is in the front seat with his feet up on the dashboard and he's, he's very bored
444380	451620	looking out the window, maybe fiddling with a finger, mom, I mean, it's just hanging out
451620	452620	with some friends.
452620	454100	That's, that's all it is.
454740	455740	That's all it's ever been.
455740	456740	It's just hanging out.
456740	457740	Don't you think you're too old for this?
457740	460340	Going out and looking for ghosts or whatever the heck it is you all do?
460340	464140	To be honest with you, mom, kinda, I'm, I'm, there's a chance this is the last time you're
464140	465140	driving me.
465140	466140	That's all I'm saying.
466140	471260	Well, I'm certainly not going to let you drive to one of these little excursions.
471260	473220	Mom, Ash has a car.
473220	474340	I can, I can ride with him.
474340	476020	It'd be easier for all of us.
476020	482340	Well, you know, I do like Ash, but I just, I just don't trust that Pettymore boy.
482380	485220	Well, maybe you just haven't gotten to know him.
485220	489900	I think I've known him over the many years that he's been coming over to our house and
489900	493340	just causing all sorts of wreck and havoc all over the place.
493340	496900	I mean, it's just, it's just not who you're going to be.
496900	497900	All right.
497900	498900	Yeah, you're right.
498900	499900	You're right.
499900	501180	You were born for more than this.
501180	503060	That's, that's true.
503060	505540	I, I'm not, I'm not like them these days.
505540	507180	That's, that's, yeah.
507180	512940	She reluctantly turns onto the little gravel road that says, has got a sign next to it
512940	515780	that says the contention woods.
515780	521420	And as she pulls onto the gravel, she's going to roll a drive check.
521420	524100	Nice.
524100	532260	And as she pulls onto the gravel, a little baby Fox jumps right out into the road.
532260	533260	It's trying to sprint.
533340	538540	It seems like its leg might be broken and it tries to cross the road in front of you.
538540	540980	And her reaction time is Nada.
540980	541980	She doesn't even see it.
541980	542980	Mom, mom, mom, mom.
542980	544520	And she just crushes.
544520	553700	You feel this, mom, you just hit that wildlife ain't, ain't for nothing but game and sorrow.
553700	554700	That's cold shit.
554700	557980	Mom, you're going to have to learn one day that the world is cold shit.
557980	560060	I don't like you using that word.
560060	564740	And you guys pull into the parking lot, it's a gravel parking lot, and there are a few
564740	565740	cars there.
565740	572720	You do see two cars that one of which has a boot on it and the other has a piece of
572720	576100	paper taped up to the driver's side window.
576100	582820	You also see the 91 Firebird that Ash drives and then near the little shack, the little
582820	586740	Rangers shack right at the trailhead entrance.
586740	591940	Right next to that is an old Ford Bronco with a lift kit on it.
591940	592940	Sure.
592940	593940	Does it have signage?
593940	594940	No, it's unmarked.
594940	595940	Gotcha.
595940	596940	But the plates are state level.
596940	597940	Gotcha.
597940	603200	Immediately your mom is like, well, at least, you know, there's some sort of authority presence
603200	604200	here.
604200	605200	They'll be watching over y'all.
605200	611700	Are you scared of stuff that could happen to me or are you scared of me doing stuff?
611700	612700	Both.
612700	613700	You don't have to worry, mom.
613700	615620	Didn't you read that op-ed in the newspaper?
615620	620820	The Contention Chronicle says that we've got multiple people that are out here in the woods
620820	621820	they're missing.
621820	622820	You know?
622820	628340	So I just don't, I know that, you know, Officer Cox is working hard trying to keep everything
628340	629340	in line.
629340	634500	I trust our town's authority figures, just as everyone should, can.
634500	640500	You should trust your authority figures, currently me, but I do trust you.
640500	644780	It's just, I don't trust the influence that these boys are having on you.
644780	649740	Mom, you know me, you know, you know what you and dad have instilled in me.
649740	653260	There's no way that anything's going to happen tonight that you wouldn't be proud of.
653260	658860	Chris is a great man and I just want you, Ken, to grow up and be even better than he
658860	659860	is.
659860	663580	I mean, he is the number one used car salesman in contention.
663580	665500	He tells me all the time, I know.
665500	668540	If he wouldn't have snapped his knee, you know, he would have gone pro, but that's what
668540	671580	we're hoping for you, not the snap knee part, the going pro part, all right?
671580	672580	I know, I know.
672580	674220	You're going to lift this family up out of here.
674220	679420	Look, mom, we're going to roast some marshmallows, tell some ghost stories, and sleep in tents.
679420	680420	I did bring marshmallows.
680420	681420	Thanks, mom.
681420	682420	I love you.
682420	683420	I love you too.
683420	686240	She goes in for a kiss.
686240	691780	Just a little baby peck on the cheek for her little 14 year old boy, for her little baby
691780	692780	boy.
692780	695980	I go around the back of the car and I pull out those marshmallows.
695980	696980	Can I pull out a tent?
696980	697980	Yeah.
698420	699420	I got my tent and a sleeping bag.
699420	700420	I got my rucksack.
700420	701420	I'm prepared.
701420	702420	I've done this a few years in a row now.
702420	703420	Exactly.
703420	704420	I know what I need.
704420	709100	So you get everything about the car and she's like, I'm going to park right here and I'm
709100	712500	not going to leave until I see you go up in there, all right?
712500	713500	Okay.
713500	714500	That's fine.
714500	715500	That's fine.
715500	716500	I love you.
716500	717500	I love you.
717500	720900	I'm going to take whatever route I need to take that I can walk past that car that had
720900	721900	a note on its window.
721900	724100	I just want to read what that note says as I go.
724100	725100	Yeah, for sure.
725220	730300	So it's just a notice that says if this car is still here on a certain date, like maybe
730300	732900	a week or two from now, that it'll get booted.
732900	733900	Gotcha.
733900	737660	So I walk down the trailhead and every little while I check back and see if she's still
737660	743700	there and every time she is, I wave again, kind of exasperatedly each time.
743700	748720	And you make it up to the little shack, the little ranger's shack, and you hear a voice
748720	750660	come from inside of it.
750660	752980	Oh, hello there, weary traveler.
752980	753980	Hey.
753980	754980	Oh, hey.
755060	756060	Turtle me.
756060	757060	Hey there.
757060	758060	All right.
758060	761700	I know Jeb's not here, but my name is Woodrow.
761700	768500	It says right here, and he points to his badge, and he's like, but you can call me Buzz, as
768500	769860	that is my nickname.
769860	770860	Hey.
770860	771860	Hey, Buzz.
771860	772860	How are you tonight?
772860	775100	I'm doing quite well.
775100	780820	Just here to take a little inventory of those folks heading on into the woods this evening.
780860	785700	So if you wouldn't mind, step right up, and he grabs this Polaroid camera off the desk
785700	788420	in front of him, and he holds it up to you, and he snaps a picture.
788420	789420	Oh, hey.
789420	790420	Oh, hey there.
790420	791420	Okay.
791420	792420	Fine.
792420	793420	What is your name, young sir?
793420	794420	I'm Ken.
794420	795420	I'm Ken Krinklehoff.
795420	796420	Oh.
796420	797420	I hold out a hand for a handshake.
797420	800380	Yeah, and he goes out and he grabs it, and he is like extremely frail.
800380	804980	You see that he actually has a cane at his side, and his hands are like shaking as he
804980	806860	goes out to shake your hand.
806860	807860	Good to meet you, Buzz.
807860	810100	I'm glad to know that somebody's out here keeping an eye on everything.
810100	815020	I know somebody's got to with all these people missing in these woods, you know?
815020	820640	And he kind of points back at this board, this bulletin board behind him, and you see
820640	826140	that there are approximately 20 pictures up on the board, and there are all these Polaroids
826140	830540	that have been taken in this exact spot with a piece of paper behind them.
830540	835080	And when he asked you your name, he wrote down Ken Krinklehoff on this sheet that looks
835080	836080	similar to those.
836080	838420	And he's like, I got a couple more questions for you.
838460	840980	What are you up to tonight in these here woods?
840980	842940	Oh, me and some friends.
842940	844460	We're going to be camping out here.
844460	846020	We've done it many years in a row.
846020	849060	Oh, you look to be about the same age as these boys.
849060	853820	And he points back, and you see there's pictures of Ash and of Jeremy.
853820	855300	Yeah, that's them.
855300	857980	I'm actually heading in there to meet them now.
857980	859420	Okay.
859420	862380	Bring anything with you that's not traditional camping gear?
862380	863380	Nope.
863380	868620	My sleeping bag here, and the tent, and, you know, the essentials.
868620	869620	Hmm.
869620	870620	Yep.
870620	871620	All right, man.
871620	872620	One final question.
872620	880020	If you were to get startled and have to escape in any situation, maybe go run and hide somewhere,
880020	883940	where might it be that we could find you if we're out looking for you?
883940	887860	Hopefully that doesn't come to this, but where might we find you?
887860	889860	I'd definitely run back out here to the parking lot.
889860	891260	Yeah, that's a smart answer.
891260	895180	Your other friend said the caves over on the northwest.
895180	897340	Is it part of the woods, seemingly?
897340	898620	All right, well.
898620	902540	And you look behind him, and you see there are a couple of clipboards, and like a fire
902540	912460	extinguisher, and an ax, and a machete, and a flashlight, and that's about it in here.
912460	916520	Hey, Buzz, those missing people I've been hearing about that, have you guys got any
916520	918020	leads on that?
918020	920460	That's kind of weird that it's all happening all of a sudden.
920460	925020	It is very, very strange, and he points up to the picture of Jeb, who you might know
925020	930580	is the normal ranger who's out here, and he's like, they brought me down from the state
930580	937260	to try to clear all this up and keep these woods safe, and I'm a decorated veteran of
937260	942500	the ranger service, and I am here to make sure everything gets taken care of, sweeping
942500	944820	up the issues and whatnots.
944820	946900	But no leads?
946900	948300	Is that where them people going?
948300	950940	I have absolutely no idea.
950940	951940	Do you know?
951940	952940	I don't.
952940	954460	All right, Ken.
954460	955460	You checked around?
955460	956460	For what?
956460	957460	Missing people.
957460	958460	Who?
958460	959460	The people that have been missing.
959460	960460	Have you looked for them?
960460	961460	Yeah.
961460	962460	What'd you say?
962460	963460	Nothing.
963460	964460	It's okay, Buzz.
964460	966100	And as he's saying that, he's like rubbing his hands together.
966100	969140	He's like, all right, well, take care, I guess.
969140	970140	Thanks.
970140	971140	Thanks, Buzz.
971140	972140	Hope we don't need to see you again.
972140	973140	Well, on the way out, hopefully.
973140	975060	That would be a good time to see you again.
975060	976060	That's true.
976060	977060	Thanks.
977060	978060	See you in the morning.
978820	979820	Bye.
979820	981980	Bye, Ken.
981980	983260	Is he watching me as I go?
983260	984260	Yeah.
984260	986140	And your mom from the minivan waves and-
986140	987580	I give another wave.
987580	991900	You wave, Buzz waves, we all wave.
991900	997380	For Ken's mom, Krista Krinkelhoff.
997380	997980	Oh, Krista.
1008060	1017500	And who likes that?
1017500	1018500	What's up, guys?
1018500	1019500	Hello.
1019500	1020500	Hi.
1020500	1021500	Hello.
1021500	1025340	For our listeners, you're hearing three voices that are not Thomas, Joe, and Luke.
1025340	1031100	And that is because I am a dumb, dumb idiot boy, and I decided to do something I've wanted
1031100	1039740	to do for a long time, which is run two different groups inside the same sandbox and see what
1039740	1040740	happens.
1040740	1046740	So first off, we have a brand new voice on the podcast, and that is our good friend,
1046740	1047740	Lindsay.
1047740	1048740	Hello.
1048740	1049740	My name is Lindsay.
1049740	1050740	What?
1050740	1051740	Whoa.
1051740	1052740	Welcome.
1052740	1055660	Welcome to the podcast.
1055660	1058260	I'm so sorry.
1058260	1059260	For yourself?
1059260	1060260	As for the way I've acted.
1060260	1061260	I'm sorry for the sins.
1061260	1062260	Yes.
1062260	1069700	You're going to need to do three Bloody Marys and four shots of gin.
1069700	1074660	So Lindsay, right off the bat, do you have any RPG experience?
1074660	1075660	Yeah.
1075660	1076660	Well, yes.
1076660	1079180	I am on a D&D campaign currently.
1079180	1080180	My first one.
1080180	1081180	Nice.
1081180	1082460	And are you enjoying it thus far?
1082460	1083460	Yes.
1083460	1084460	And it's your first time role playing?
1084460	1085460	Sort of.
1085460	1087900	I was in Thespians growing up.
1088900	1089900	That's sort of the same thing.
1089900	1090900	The Thespian Society?
1090900	1091900	The Thespians.
1091900	1092900	Yeah.
1092900	1094220	I was in The Thespian Society too.
1094220	1098260	I don't know if our listeners would believe that or a bunch of drama nerds.
1098260	1099260	Yeah.
1099260	1100260	Shocker.
1100260	1102700	Lindsay, what's something fascinating about you?
1102700	1103700	About me in real life?
1103700	1104700	Yeah.
1104700	1105700	Okay.
1105700	1106700	This is the one I always use.
1106700	1112420	My great uncle by blood is Phil Jackson, the ex-coach of the Lakers in the bowl school.
1112420	1113420	What?
1113420	1114420	Yeah.
1114420	1115420	I don't talk to him.
1115420	1116420	I don't know him.
1116420	1117420	Sure.
1117940	1118940	Yeah.
1118940	1119940	My brother used to write him letters and stuff.
1119940	1120940	Oh my God.
1120940	1121940	Did he get a response?
1121940	1122940	Yeah.
1122940	1123940	He actually got some free tickets.
1123940	1124940	Wow.
1124940	1125940	I can't wait to know that.
1125940	1126940	Can we offer that to our listeners?
1126940	1127940	Absolutely.
1127940	1128940	What's his address?
1128940	1129940	Oh my God.
1129940	1133820	Let's get that phone number, Asaac.
1133820	1135820	She's like the zen master.
1135820	1136820	I know.
1136820	1137820	He wears a crystal around his neck.
1137820	1138820	Oh my God.
1138820	1139820	Yep.
1139820	1140820	Oh my God.
1140820	1141820	And so does Lindsay for the listeners at home.
1141820	1142820	Oh yes.
1142820	1143820	Every day.
1143820	1145300	What is the crystal that you have around your neck right now?
1145300	1151060	The crystal that I have around my neck right now is this very special invisible, which
1151060	1154260	makes it more special, magic crystal.
1154260	1157240	And I'm not going to tell you what it does, so you're just going to have to watch out.
1157240	1159820	If you tell us what it does, will it not work anymore?
1159820	1160820	Truly.
1160820	1161820	Yes.
1161820	1165180	I'm more of a fan of Bonam Veeve, but that's just me.
1165180	1166180	Ali.
1166180	1169140	Ali Jepsen is also- That's a joke.
1169140	1170740	My husband makes jokes.
1170740	1171920	Oh, Taylor.
1171920	1173340	Thank you for pointing out my jokes.
1173380	1177380	I really hope that you do that throughout your entire tenure on this podcast.
1177380	1180380	Can I just say joke every time you say a joke?
1180380	1181380	Yeah.
1181380	1182380	As long as you say it exactly like that.
1182380	1183380	Joke.
1183380	1184380	That was already different.
1184380	1188380	Ali, I don't appreciate you and I wish you would leave.
1188380	1189380	Oh.
1189380	1190380	Got it.
1190380	1191380	Speaking of Ali.
1191380	1192380	Ali Jepsen.
1192380	1193380	Oh, can we say your last name?
1193380	1194380	Did I dox you?
1194380	1195380	No, you're fine.
1195380	1196380	All right.
1196380	1197380	Ali, welcome back.
1197380	1198380	Thank you for playing Brett.
1198380	1199380	Ah, yes.
1199380	1200380	Of course.
1200380	1201380	On the podcast for our listeners.
1201380	1202380	Long live Brett.
1202420	1203420	Long live Brett.
1203420	1204420	Did Brett die?
1204420	1205420	Brett died.
1205420	1206420	But he's a robot, you know?
1206420	1207420	Long die Brett.
1207420	1208420	Robots come back.
1208420	1211420	Spoilers for the podcast.
1211420	1216300	Please, if this is your first episode, go back and listen to our back catalog.
1216300	1220660	You might just be here to listen to Ali and Taylor and Lindsay and that's fine, but the
1220660	1225220	story will be better if you- If you chose to start 50 something episodes
1225220	1226220	in.
1226220	1227220	True.
1227220	1228220	47.
1228220	1229220	You made a mistake.
1229220	1231220	This is Lindsay speaking and I have to say, I have listened to every single episode.
1231220	1232220	They're going to ignore our voices.
1233060	1234060	Cool.
1234060	1235060	Well, all right.
1235060	1237340	Um, I- No, every single- Sorry.
1237340	1238340	This is Zach.
1238340	1240860	Every single time that you speak, you should joke.
1240860	1242980	Taylor said that was Taylor.
1242980	1243980	She said that.
1243980	1244980	Joke.
1244980	1247660	No one takes my jokes.
1247660	1248660	Hey, real quick.
1248660	1249880	Ali, what's your favorite joke?
1249880	1252220	My favorite joke?
1252220	1254220	What's the favorite joke that I've said?
1254220	1256800	Of all the jokes I've said.
1256800	1260740	When I was in fourth grade, I had no friends and I thought this joke will help me.
1260740	1265700	It was from my joke book and it said, what did the needle say to the thread?
1265700	1266700	I don't know.
1266700	1267700	What did the needle say to the thread?
1267700	1270300	The needle said, need a little help there?
1270300	1271300	Ooh.
1271300	1272300	And?
1272300	1273300	And I still didn't have friends.
1273300	1274300	Because friends of myself.
1274300	1275300	To this day.
1275300	1276300	To this day.
1276300	1278620	I don't know who any of these people are.
1278620	1281060	Well, thank you for being here.
1281060	1285100	I'm excited to have you both on and you are both part of-
1285100	1286100	Basement cast.
1286100	1287100	Yeah, a comedy group.
1287100	1288100	A comedy show.
1288100	1289100	Me too.
1289100	1290100	Can I be on it?
1291100	1293100	No, Taylor, you're not in the group.
1293100	1296380	We told you, you can only be in the one show.
1296380	1298580	And then never come back because you talked about anal beads.
1298580	1303420	I sort of thought that on the podcast was the appropriate time for me to ask to be on
1303420	1306900	the show because you can't say no to my jokes.
1306900	1307900	Joke.
1310900	1313340	Taylor, you're basically a vet on the podcast.
1313340	1314340	Thank you.
1314340	1317860	Is that an appropriate time to say thank you?
1317860	1318860	Thank you.
1318860	1319860	Thank you.
1320620	1323620	It's a husband and it's a PDM.
1323620	1324620	PDM.
1324620	1325620	DM.
1325620	1326620	What?
1326620	1327620	The DM.
1327620	1328620	What's PDM?
1328620	1329620	The Game Master DM.
1329620	1330620	Yeah, welcome.
1330620	1331620	The Dungeon Master.
1331620	1335980	And if you had one extra hour of free time a day, how would you use it?
1335980	1337500	I would pet my cats.
1337500	1339700	Which one more than the other one?
1339700	1342220	You're not supposed to say which cat you like more than the other.
1342220	1343220	I like Ramona and Northern Ropo.
1343220	1344220	They can understand.
1344220	1345220	I know you feel that way.
1345220	1349220	Which makes me want to choose Ropo because she's lonely.
1349580	1352860	But I also kind of really like Ramona.
1352860	1353860	It's hard to say.
1353860	1357100	They're both such dynamic personalities.
1357100	1359100	They're so different from each other.
1359100	1361700	And that's enough cat talk for the podcast.
1361700	1362700	Thanks for listening this far.
1362700	1364700	I'm just trying to get on the percast.
1364700	1365700	Oh my god.
1365700	1368700	Why didn't you say joke after that?
1368700	1372700	It's not a joke, it's the percast.
1372700	1373700	It's a podcast.
1373700	1378460	All right, we don't talk about other podcasts on this podcast.
1378700	1379700	That is disgusting.
1379700	1383700	And I'm going to tell Luke that you did that into his mic.
1383700	1387700	Okay, Taylor told me that whatever his name is farts into this mic.
1387700	1390700	Thomas did fart directly into that microphone.
1390700	1393700	And I didn't change the screen for it.
1393700	1395700	Oh, she's right up in it.
1395700	1396700	Wow.
1396700	1397700	I don't smell anything.
1397700	1400700	That was an appropriate time to inhale into the microphone.
1400700	1404700	But like I just said, if we could not do that during the recording session, that would be
1404700	1405700	phenomenal.
1405700	1406700	Inhale?
1406700	1407700	You are disgusting.
1407940	1408940	No inhaling.
1408940	1410940	On this show, otherwise I have to edit out.
1410940	1412940	Hold your breath and then talk.
1412940	1414940	Yeah, like a swimmer.
1414940	1418940	Can you hear this?
1418940	1423940	Microphone etiquette is so easy to learn, so hard to master.
1423940	1429940	Why did you say it like that?
1429940	1431940	Ellie, stop laughing.
1431940	1432940	This is not a time for comedy.
1432940	1434940	You are being very inappropriate.
1434940	1436940	Let's talk about the characters you guys have made.
1437180	1442180	So like I said, we're going to be running two side by side stories, but it's only going
1442180	1443180	to start that way.
1443180	1447180	And these characters all go to the same high school, which is the Silas Cole K through
1447180	1449180	12 in contention.
1449180	1454180	A lot of different kids at this school and still not that many children there.
1454180	1456180	And some of them have gone missing recently.
1456180	1458180	We'll get into more of that later.
1458180	1460180	Allie, tell us about your character.
1460180	1462180	Judy Kringlehoff is my character.
1462180	1464180	She's great.
1464420	1467420	Judy goes to Silas Cole.
1467420	1469420	She's a senior.
1469420	1471420	She's a total outcast.
1471420	1478420	She is still wearing the same clothes she bought for freshman year, which are too ill-fitting.
1478420	1481420	They're like all tight and short, but in the wrong ways.
1481420	1485420	Does she have like one of those Kringle shirts that when you buy it, it looks like it could
1485420	1486420	fit a doll and then it expands?
1486420	1487420	Yes.
1487420	1491420	Oh, she for sure has those, but they're like uncomfortably tight on her where you're like
1491660	1493660	This is not one size fits all.
1493660	1496660	She never says the right thing.
1496660	1498660	She's very anxious.
1498660	1501660	She's always nervous about stuff.
1501660	1503660	She just wants to be popular.
1503660	1508660	She wants to be popular and she wants to be in a relationship with the coolest gal at
1508660	1511660	school, but the odds are not in her favor.
1511660	1516660	And you have parents who have already been mentioned on this podcast because your younger
1516660	1520660	brother is Ken Kringlehoff, who's being played by Joe.
1520900	1521900	Ken.
1521900	1525900	Ken is what I was never able to be.
1525900	1531900	Ken's the star child and I'm not a disappointment to my parents, but they're not super proud
1531900	1538900	of where I am, which is like 17th row in band.
1538900	1543900	So I'm just like, they give me a tuba, but they're like, don't put your mouth on it.
1543900	1546900	Like just sit there with the tuba and pet it.
1546900	1548900	And that's what you'll do.
1548900	1549900	And that's what I do.
1550140	1555140	So Ken's like, you know, he's a, uh, he's a star athlete star athlete.
1555140	1557140	Like you said earlier, he's the star child.
1557140	1562140	So Alistair Huxley, Alistair Crowley, who's Alistair Huxley?
1562140	1570140	He wrote Brave New World and Alistair Crowley tried to bring about the star child.
1570140	1571140	Sorry, no big deal.
1571140	1574140	Just the spawn of Satan and not Ken Kringlehoff.
1574140	1579140	You were speaking of having a little crush on the coolest girl in school.
1579380	1581380	I have a crush on the coolest girl in school.
1581380	1584380	Well, she's not the coolest, but she's like the rebel of school.
1584380	1588380	And I'm so attracted to that, but she's kind of a bully to me.
1588380	1590380	And who is this monster that you're speaking of?
1590380	1594380	Her name is Liz.
1594380	1597380	Say your own name, Lindsay.
1597380	1599380	It's really hard to remember.
1599380	1600380	My name is Liz.
1600380	1606380	She only calls her Elizabeth cause she thinks it's more romantic, but that drives Liz crazy.
1606620	1609620	Liz goes by Liz and that's fucking it.
1609620	1614620	But Judy calls her Elizabeth because she thinks it's sexy and maybe one day Liz will realize.
1614620	1616620	That she's been in Elizabeth all this time.
1616620	1619620	That she's been in Elizabeth all this time and she's meant to be with Judy.
1619620	1621620	Judy and Elizabeth, man.
1621620	1623620	Juzabeth.
1623620	1625620	I ship that herd.
1625620	1627620	You ship it?
1627620	1628620	It's a teen term, guys.
1628620	1630620	All right, Liz, let's hear it.
1630620	1631620	What you got?
1631860	1636860	So Liz, you've already heard is like the rebel of school slash coolest in school.
1636860	1638860	But I mean, not really.
1638860	1641860	I'm not popular or I try not to be.
1641860	1642860	I don't know.
1642860	1644860	Picture like Rizzo.
1644860	1645860	Is that her name?
1645860	1647860	From Greece?
1647860	1649860	Yeah, I thought you were mispronouncing Lizzo.
1649860	1650860	No, no, no.
1650860	1652860	That's what he said earlier.
1652860	1654860	That's why I second guessed it.
1654860	1655860	Rizzo from Greece, yeah?
1655860	1656860	Yes.
1656860	1657860	Yes.
1657860	1658860	The original Lizzo.
1658860	1659860	No, definitely not.
1659860	1660860	I'm sorry.
1661100	1662100	I take it back.
1662100	1663100	Lizzo doesn't deserve that.
1663100	1664100	No.
1664100	1665100	But yeah, picture me.
1665100	1666100	Picture me.
1666100	1667100	I'm Sandra Dee.
1667100	1668100	Oh.
1668100	1669100	Get out of this room.
1669100	1670100	Don't picture that.
1670100	1671100	Look at me.
1671100	1672100	It's actually, fuck.
1672100	1673100	God damn it.
1673100	1674100	Greece knowledge.
1674100	1676100	Shit.
1676100	1681100	In high school, Zach played Danny DeVito.
1681100	1682100	I did.
1682100	1683100	I played Danny DeVito.
1683100	1684100	Danny DeVito in Greece.
1684100	1685100	Oh my God, Zach.
1685100	1686100	As a sophomore in high school.
1686100	1687100	That's real.
1687100	1688100	That's real.
1688100	1689100	He did that.
1689100	1690100	I didn't know him back then.
1690340	1692340	It's okay, because I didn't know him.
1692340	1695340	That's our bedroom floor play.
1695340	1697340	Jesus Christ.
1697340	1699340	We didn't need to know.
1699340	1701340	Look at me.
1701340	1703340	I'm just here.
1703340	1706340	I just love her voice so much.
1706340	1708340	All right.
1708340	1713340	Lindsay, let's talk more about Lizz and less about my high school musical career.
1713340	1715340	Lizz Lonklin.
1715340	1716340	Okay, yeah.
1716340	1718340	So you're picturing Rizzo.
1718340	1719340	I'm picturing Rizzo.
1719580	1721580	I'm picturing Lizzo with an R.
1721580	1723580	The little rat from Muppets.
1723580	1724580	Oh, no.
1724580	1725580	Like a lamb, not the rat.
1725580	1727580	Like a lamb, not the rat.
1727580	1728580	Oh, shoot.
1728580	1729580	No.
1729580	1730580	That's not it.
1730580	1731580	That's not the right one.
1731580	1736580	So leather jacket, cigarette, Doc Martens, and bitch.
1736580	1739580	She's wearing a bitch.
1739580	1741580	She's wearing a bitch.
1741580	1743580	She also is a bitch.
1743580	1747580	Well, I'll try to find a way to love Lizz in our own way.
1747820	1749820	I'm sure by the end you will love Lizz.
1749820	1750820	I love Lizz.
1750820	1751820	Right?
1751820	1752820	Right.
1752820	1753820	You already love Lizz.
1753820	1754820	I love her so much.
1754820	1757820	Try to make a likable character that way when I kill it, it'll be better.
1757820	1759820	It'll be likable in some way.
1759820	1760820	All right.
1760820	1761820	Perfect.
1761820	1763820	Taylor, you're also here.
1763820	1769820	My name is Sharon Berryman, but I prefer to go by Shadow, and if anyone in this room doesn't
1769820	1772820	call me Shadow, I'm going to fucking lose my mind.
1772820	1773820	Oh, shit.
1773820	1774820	Just kidding.
1774820	1775820	Okay, Sharon.
1776060	1779060	My dad is listening to this, and I didn't say the F word.
1779060	1781060	I have never said it in my entire life.
1781060	1782060	I don't even know what it is.
1782060	1783060	Farts?
1783060	1784060	Farts.
1784060	1786060	I'm going to fart and lose my mind.
1786060	1793060	Okay, so Sharon Berryman used to be a cheerleader, like used to be popular, very bendy, come
1793060	1801060	from money, and then a particular event happened in my life that led me in a different direction,
1801300	1805300	and now I'm obsessed with death in all forms.
1805300	1808300	Wait, what are the different forms of death, please?
1808300	1809300	Well, like-
1809300	1810300	And first, how many are there?
1810300	1812300	New death, mid-death, old death.
1812300	1813300	Great.
1813300	1814300	Your classic deaths.
1814300	1820300	You know, like I hang out in cemeteries to get my old death.
1820300	1821300	I-
1821300	1823300	Past death.
1823300	1824300	Yeah.
1824300	1830300	I also, I like to spend time in funeral homes and attend funerals for like-
1830540	1831540	Current death.
1831540	1832540	My mid-death, yeah.
1832540	1833540	Oh, mid-death, right.
1833540	1836540	Yeah, but then I go to hospitals for like that new, new.
1836540	1837540	Oh, shit.
1837540	1838540	Jesus.
1838540	1839540	Oh my God.
1839540	1843540	You're like 16 years old.
1843540	1844540	17.
1844540	1847540	The nurses at the contention clinic all know Shadow.
1847540	1850540	They're like, will someone get Shadow out of here again?
1850540	1851540	Shadow, get out.
1851540	1852540	How'd she get in here?
1852540	1856540	I used to be a candy striper, but then they kept finding me in the-
1856540	1859540	She's leering at the close to deads again.
1859780	1860780	Yeah.
1860780	1862780	She's like, but don't you want to die?
1862780	1865780	Well, the whole thing is like, I really want to speak to the other side.
1865780	1871780	So I sort of, it's like prudent for me to be there for all processes of death.
1871780	1872780	Yeah.
1872780	1874780	That absolutely makes sense.
1874780	1880780	So we are going to kick off actually role playing in three, let's get the music.
1881020	1887020	Later Zach, put in the music right now.
1901020	1908020	So the story starts inside the public library of contention, a place that we have seen before.
1908260	1913260	It is a rarely used building because as one might suspect,
1913260	1918260	the population of contention owns all their books.
1918260	1922260	That one was just for me.
1922260	1927260	Standing behind the entry desk, there are two individuals.
1927260	1934260	One is either an extremely young or an extremely old man with a sweater vest and sleeve tattoos
1934260	1937260	on both arms, I believe.
1937500	1943500	The other one's a young man who is wearing a sweater with another sweater wrapped around
1943500	1945500	over his shoulders.
1945500	1951500	And on top of that one, he has a second sweater that is wrapped around his waist as well.
1951500	1956500	And he is wearing gold rings on all of his fingers.
1956500	1961500	And the young man in all the sweaters looks up at the three of you as you walk into the
1961500	1965500	contention public library and he says, oh, hello.
1965740	1970740	Thank you so much for coming to the contention public library, whatever it is that we could
1970740	1972740	do for you today on a day such as this.
1972740	1976740	Is there anything in particular that you might be here of any interest?
1976740	1981740	Is there many lands within these pages that we can, I don't know if you know me.
1981740	1987740	My name is Steven pages, cousin of the esteemed Carrie pages, valedictorian of Silas Cole.
1987740	1989740	Yeah, I don't care about any of that.
1989740	1994740	I just want you to point us in the direction of the occult books.
1994980	1996980	Your gentleman's ears perk up.
1996980	2001980	Oh, my sweet little patty cakes, please follow me and I'll lead you there.
2001980	2005980	I do wish you would tell me what it is you're looking for.
2005980	2009980	Shadow, he's like really scaring me right now.
2009980	2014980	Could you just go back, take us to what we want to look at without him coming with us?
2014980	2020980	Look, sir, we just want you to point us in the direction of the occult books and that
2020980	2021980	would be just fine.
2021980	2023980	Oh, yes, of course.
2023980	2028980	I'm so sorry for intruding on your girly time.
2028980	2032980	Can you just explain what kind of book it is we're looking for?
2032980	2036980	Yeah, we're looking for any kind of book that has to do with voodoo.
2036980	2038980	Oh, voodoo you say?
2038980	2039980	Yes, of course.
2039980	2045980	I have at least one book that is about voodoo and it is right in the occult section and
2045980	2051980	Steven pages begins walking you to the back of the library and there is a small room in
2051980	2058580	the back with a curtain over it and there's a sign that is hanging off of one nail and
2058580	2067540	it says occult but the OC in front has been like crossed out and inside you find a bookshelf
2067540	2075280	with six shelves and each shelf has one book on it and there is a shelf marked voodoo on
2075280	2083980	which there is a single book and it is entitled voodoo.
2083980	2086380	Do you want to voodoo?
2086380	2088480	I do want to voodoo.
2088480	2092280	If you want to voodoo, this would be the place to do voodoo.
2092280	2093880	I would like to voodoo.
2093880	2095280	Okay, perfect.
2095280	2098680	This is exactly the book that I was hoping would be here.
2098680	2104480	Okay, if we just flip to page 419, we're gonna find exactly how to get rid of your
2104480	2105480	dude.
2105480	2108080	We're not looking to get rid of a dude.
2108080	2112480	I want to torture Britney.
2112480	2114480	She slept with my boyfriend.
2114480	2118480	Oh my god, that's like so mean of Britney to do.
2118480	2119480	Right?
2119480	2122480	He was so lucky to have you.
2122480	2123480	You're beautiful.
2123480	2124480	You're like so beautiful.
2124480	2127480	He was so lucky to have you and you're so beautiful and pretty.
2128480	2129480	And also smart.
2129480	2130480	He was so lucky.
2130480	2133480	Okay, go swallow a dime, Judy.
2133480	2134480	Calm down.
2134480	2137480	Okay, let's just check this out and go back to your house list.
2137480	2142880	Sounds like a plan, but real quick, looking at page 419, you see there are a few ingredients
2142880	2146080	necessary to performing this ritual.
2146080	2151080	There's also a bit of fine print at the bottom of each page that states this book voodoo
2151080	2157280	is merely a collection of rituals put together by a woman named Lulu Fufu Voodoo and is in
2157280	2162080	no way associated with any religious ideologies or practices with a similar name.
2162080	2168080	Also, page 419 notes this ritual must be performed surrounded by trees.
2168080	2170680	Okay guys, that sounds like pretty scary.
2170680	2171680	We should just shut up.
2171680	2174080	And it needs to be done at night.
2174080	2177080	There's a woods right by my house that would be perfect.
2177080	2180880	I go there in the middle of the night naked all the time.
2180880	2181880	That sounds perfect.
2181880	2185080	Okay, but like we have to be there in the dark because...
2185080	2186080	Judy!
2187080	2188880	Judy, don't worry.
2188880	2192880	We'll hold hands and bask in the moonlight the entire time.
2192880	2194880	It'll be beautiful.
2194880	2197880	Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, but in the dark...
2197880	2198880	Judy!
2198880	2200880	My god!
2200880	2206480	So real quick, let's make up a list of ingredients for performing this spell.
2206480	2207780	I will start.
2207780	2214880	You need the left pinky toe of a dead squirrel.
2215680	2216680	Oh, okay.
2216680	2221480	Allie, what is the second thing that you might need for this voodoo spell?
2221480	2227680	This spell says that we need dirt scraped from the earth after it's been stepped on
2227680	2230680	by a calf that's menstruating.
2233680	2235680	How the fuck are we gonna find that?
2235680	2243680	Third thing is the blood from a former cheerleader gone goth that goes to...
2244480	2245480	Silas Cole K through 12.
2245480	2247480	Yep, Silas Cole K through 12.
2247480	2249480	I think I know where I can get that.
2249480	2250480	It says that in the book.
2250480	2251480	Yep.
2251480	2252480	Called voodoo.
2252480	2253480	Yep, voodoo do you.
2253480	2254480	Do you voodoo.
2254480	2255480	Do you voodoo.
2255480	2256480	Do you voodoo.
2256480	2257480	Do you voodoo.
2257480	2258480	To do voodoo.
2258480	2260480	Lindsay, what is the fourth thing?
2260480	2261480	Okay, final?
2261480	2262480	The fourth and final?
2262480	2263480	Fourth and final thing.
2263480	2264480	The fourth and final thing.
2264480	2269480	I'm gonna say, because I have to pee so bad right now.
2269480	2270480	Urine?
2271280	2274280	Which we all know is also bird poop.
2274280	2275280	What?
2275280	2277280	Wait, we all know that?
2277280	2278280	We all know that?
2278280	2279280	When a bird pees, it also poops.
2279280	2280280	Is that why it's so runny?
2280280	2281280	It's mixed.
2281280	2282280	Yes.
2282280	2283280	Oh my god.
2283280	2285280	Actually, that's what mine does too.
2285280	2286280	What, your bird?
2286280	2287280	Yeah, it's mixed.
2287280	2288280	Oh, hell.
2288280	2290280	And if you're a bird, I'm a bird.
2293280	2298680	Smash cut to you guys slamming the book closed and then realizing that nobody has a library
2298680	2299680	card.
2299880	2302880	Dear, dear, dear, what will you do?
2302880	2305180	Look, we need this book.
2305180	2306180	We need it now.
2306180	2313040	Oh, my dear, sweet little baby, there is a process and there is a three day processing
2313040	2314040	fee.
2314040	2315040	Fuck this.
2315040	2317040	How do libraries work?
2317040	2322880	Okay, I don't know if this will help, but my parents' names are Chris and Krista Krinklehoff.
2322880	2323880	Oh, your parents?
2323880	2324880	Oh my goodness.
2324880	2327100	Are the Krinklehoff's?
2327100	2331580	We play bridge with them every Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.
2331580	2332580	That's right.
2332580	2335580	Me and my old friend, Gerald Fingersen, and your parents-
2335580	2338460	Thank you for saying my name right, my dear boy.
2338460	2339780	We'll just put it on their account.
2339780	2341660	Thank you so much.
2341660	2345100	Would you like a poppy seed muffin for your walk home?
2345100	2347100	I'm allergic to poppies and peas.
2347100	2350700	Oh my god, me too, twinsies.
2350700	2353780	Smash cut to you guys leaving the library with the book.
2353780	2358160	Smash cut to you guys on the side of the road, all bent over a dead squirrel, cutting
2358160	2361960	off the pinky toe of the roadkill.
2361960	2368860	Smash cut to you guys all in a field where there is a cow that is bleeding out of its
2368860	2375820	lady butt, and then you guys scoop the dirt into a bucket or something.
2375820	2380880	Smash cut to you guys just standing in a parking lot, looking up, and there's a bunch of birds
2380880	2381880	in the sky.
2381880	2384480	They're all just waiting.
2384480	2392120	Bird shits on the ground, and you guys collect the not shit, not piss, but both.
2392120	2393120	Both.
2393120	2394120	The mixture of both.
2394120	2399520	And then you guys get a cocktail strainer and strain out the piss, because it says urine.
2399520	2405800	Smash cut to you guys all standing outside of one of your cars, and you're talking about
2405800	2408160	how to get the blood part.
2408160	2411320	Liz, do you have that squirrel toe?
2411760	2417640	Yeah, I do, but my question is, how the hell are we gonna get this goth cheerleader blood?
2417640	2421520	I just had this idea, and my idea is that it's me.
2421520	2422520	What?
2422520	2423520	Yeah.
2423520	2425520	Does you not know that I used to be a cheerleader?
2425520	2426520	Gross.
2426520	2429600	I can do seven back bends in a row.
2429600	2432680	And then Shadow does seven back bends in a row.
2432680	2433680	Whatever the fuck that is.
2433680	2435680	And also, do you do them in a row?
2435680	2440600	No, back bend and then back handspring to another back bend, but they're slow.
2440600	2442080	It's a gymnastics thing.
2442080	2446240	Okay, so do you wanna get your blood out now, or do you wanna let it out later?
2446240	2451800	No, I wanna let it out now if Liz will just give me the frickin' squirrel toe.
2451800	2454320	Why do I need to give you the squirrel toe for you to let out the blood?
2454320	2455320	It's easy, Liz.
2455320	2456320	It's easy.
2456320	2461400	You just take the nail of the squirrel toe and I scratch it on my finger and blood comes
2461400	2462400	out.
2462400	2463880	Well, where are you gonna put the blood?
2463880	2467080	Into my hand.
2467080	2468080	And then put it-
2469080	2470080	Really gross.
2470080	2471080	Judy.
2471080	2472080	Judy.
2472080	2473080	I'm really sorry, Elizabeth.
2473080	2474080	Please.
2474080	2475080	I'm sorry.
2475080	2479360	I've done just this kind of ritual before and it always goes fine, okay?
2479360	2482000	You're gonna just hold the blood until we get into the deep woods?
2482000	2484280	Well, I just figured that maybe you would be okay.
2484280	2487040	I do have a vial of- Well, then what the hell?
2487040	2489000	Well, it's already- Get the vial.
2489000	2493040	It's already holding someone else's blood, but I guess I can pour that out.
2493040	2500400	Um, I hate to be, like, a bitch right now, but, like, who's blood is in it?
2500400	2501720	I don't want to talk about it.
2501720	2505080	It's my ex.
2505080	2510760	It was just a mutual agreement to not date anymore and then I just got a little bit of
2510760	2511760	his blood after.
2511760	2512760	Yeah, I don't care even.
2512760	2517720	If Elizabeth doesn't care, I don't care either.
2517720	2521960	Okay, let's just gather all of our things up.
2521960	2524160	We'll go have a sleepover at my house.
2524160	2528260	My parents are, like, totally chill and they don't care about anything, even me.
2528260	2533600	They don't, like, even care if I love, live, or die, and then we can go into the forest
2533600	2534600	tonight.
2534600	2537680	They don't care if you love, live, or die.
2537680	2538680	Love was part of it.
2538680	2540240	But they really want you to laugh.
2540240	2550760	All right, so let us, Tomato, go back in time to, like, two days ago when I believe it was
2550760	2560760	Shadow who told Liz that her boyfriend, Derek, was seen cheating on her with Brittany.
2560760	2562680	Let's cut back to that scene.
2562680	2566360	The bell rings and you guys are all standing outside of one of your lockers.
2566360	2567360	Hey, Liz.
2567360	2568360	What?
2568360	2569360	How are you doing today?
2569360	2570360	Sorry, I'm just trying to be nice.
2570360	2573360	I'm just trying to start a nice conversation with you.
2573360	2575720	Could you just, like, not be a bitch for one second?
2575720	2576720	Could you just, like, get to the point?
2576720	2577720	Yeah, that's a really good point.
2577880	2581480	Hey, if you guys are friends, you shouldn't talk to each other like that.
2581480	2582760	Who the hell are you?
2582760	2585840	I forgot my name, but I was in the last episode.
2585840	2590720	Well, we're not friends yet.
2590720	2594160	It's just a budding friendship that's gonna happen, probably.
2594160	2597040	Oh, then this seems like a nice start.
2597040	2603020	Anyway, Liz, I just wanted to check in on you because you know your boyfriend's been
2603020	2604320	cheating on you.
2604320	2605320	What?
2605320	2606960	Oh, you didn't know?
2606960	2608440	With fucking who?
2608440	2610280	I don't know, some girl named, like, Britney.
2610280	2618000	I think she goes to, like, Spinkbonk High, which is, like, 15 miles down the road.
2618000	2619000	Fucking Spinkbonk?
2619000	2624440	I know, it's, like, most of them are total trash, but, like, I think she's kind of cute.
2624440	2627120	I don't want to, like, put salt in the wound, but...
2627120	2632240	Listen, Elizabeth, there's no way that that girl is cuter than you.
2632240	2633240	There's literally no way.
2633240	2634880	I mean, there's a way, but...
2634880	2637000	No, like, she couldn't be cuter than you.
2637000	2639120	What a- what a be-on.
2639120	2645600	Anyway, I just thought you should know that, like, Derek is not available, like, emotionally
2645600	2649760	anymore and I just, like, really want to be there for you right now.
2649760	2652120	Elizabeth, like, what can we do for you?
2652120	2657000	Can we, like, touch you or help you in any way?
2657000	2662080	Can we touch you?
2662080	2664080	What's your love language?
2664480	2665480	Excuse me, what's your name?
2665480	2667480	Can we buy you any gifts?
2667480	2672480	Do you want to be, like, quality time?
2672480	2675480	Excuse me, who the hell are you?
2675480	2677480	Um, my name's Judy.
2677480	2684480	Um, I sit behind you in English lint, and I sit behind you and I smell your perfume
2684480	2688480	a lot, even though I think it's not really perfume, I think it's just the cigarettes
2688480	2691480	that you chew up after you smoke them.
2691880	2694880	Get your shit together, Judy.
2694880	2700880	Is that the same type of cigarette you've been hoarding in your purse and ziplock bags?
2700880	2703880	I don't even know what you're talking about.
2703880	2706880	I collect trash off the side of the road because I'm a good person.
2706880	2709880	It's not just the trash.
2709880	2710880	You make a person?
2710880	2711880	Because I'm a good person.
2711880	2714880	What, you make a person out of the cigarette butts?
2714880	2715880	That's really cool.
2715880	2716880	That's, like, art, man.
2716880	2718880	No, I said I'm a good person.
2719280	2720280	Are you gay Arnold style?
2720280	2721280	Like, in your closet?
2721280	2724280	I don't, I'm not allowed to watch Arnold.
2724280	2727280	It's not Arnold.
2727280	2733280	Anyway, Liz, I'm really sorry that this has happened to you, so, like...
2733280	2736280	Yeah, whatever, I'm already over it, but here's the deal.
2736280	2738280	I'm gonna need your help.
2738280	2740280	I mean, I'm kind of busy on...
2740280	2743280	No, no, no, we can, no, we can help her, Shadow.
2743280	2744280	You can totally reschedule that.
2744280	2745280	Yeah, you can help me.
2745280	2746280	You have time.
2746280	2747280	I know your schedule.
2747280	2748280	I have orchestra rehearsal.
2748680	2749680	Shadow, Shadow, listen, we can help her.
2749680	2750680	I'll help you.
2750680	2752680	I'll do your orchestra for you.
2752680	2756680	Okay, only if it's something I'm actually interested in will I help you.
2756680	2758680	So, like, what is it you even want to do?
2758680	2763180	Smash cut to you guys in the car on the way to the woods that night after you've spent
2763180	2768760	some time at Shadow's house and Shadow is, like, holding up the vial, like, flicking
2768760	2774280	it and it's got her blood already inside of it and you guys have all of the ingredients
2774280	2778080	necessary to do voodoo and who is driving?
2778080	2780280	And three, two, one point at the person who's driving.
2780280	2781280	Three, two, one.
2781280	2785280	That is two points at Shadow, one point at Judy.
2785280	2787280	So, Shadow is driving.
2787280	2788280	Shadow, what kind of car do you have?
2788280	2789280	Oh, I have...
2789280	2795280	So, my parents have a ton of money, so I have a Lamborghini.
2795280	2797280	Shit.
2797280	2798280	Weird.
2798280	2799280	Super weird.
2799280	2801280	It's what I always chose in the...
2801280	2802280	Weird flex, but all right.
2802280	2805280	It's what I always chose in the game Mash for my car.
2805280	2806280	Mash.
2806280	2807280	Mash.
2807280	2811280	Me and my brother always had a VW Beetle on there.
2811280	2812280	We were very into beetles.
2812280	2813280	Yeah, is that going to happen?
2813280	2815280	I just had this conversation over the weekend.
2815280	2820280	Lamborghini 2017, even though it was 2013 when this all went down.
2820280	2821280	Nope, not even close.
2821280	2822280	Yeah, times don't matter.
2822280	2823280	Nope.
2823280	2824280	Oh, it's the 90s.
2824280	2825280	Times don't matter.
2825280	2828280	Oh, it's the 90s.
2828280	2835280	It is a 2017 Lamborghini, and you guys are flying down the road to the contention woods.
2835280	2840280	When you turn right onto the gravel road that takes you into the parking lot of the contention
2840280	2843280	woods, I need you to roll a drive check for me.
2843280	2845280	I have a 4D drive.
2845280	2846280	All right.
2846280	2847280	Excuse me.
2847280	2848280	I'm so sorry.
2848280	2849280	I'm sorry.
2849280	2850280	I'm sorry.
2850280	2851280	I'm sorry.
2851280	2852280	I'm sorry.
2852280	2853280	I'm sorry.
2853280	2854280	And I got a 4.
2854280	2859280	There is a possum that walks directly in front of you, and you dodge.
2859280	2861280	No, I don't want to, because-
2861280	2863280	You drive however best you see fit.
2863280	2866280	There's a possum staring you directly in the eyes.
2866280	2871280	You can see that there is fear in its ears.
2871280	2873280	Confront your death, little possum.
2873280	2875280	Today's your day to go.
2875280	2879280	And then I go straight for it.
2879280	2885280	It looks, and then it turns, and it sits on its back legs and just freezes right in the
2885280	2889280	headlights, and your front bumper just crushes its face.
2889280	2895280	I immediately pull over to go examine.
2895280	2899280	Feel free to chip in with your thoughts on what I'm doing at any time.
2899280	2902280	Judy's really freaking out, if that's any.
2902280	2905280	You guys, come look.
2905280	2907280	He's super, super dead.
2907280	2914280	He's definitely in a better, or different, or maybe non-existent place, but I'm so happy for him.
2914280	2918280	I'm smoking a cigarette, and I'm like, ugh, shut up.
2918280	2924280	No, but really, what do you think the last thoughts this possum had before he died?
2924280	2927280	Oh.
2927280	2930280	Shadow.
2930280	2932280	I have a question.
2932280	2933280	Do possi-
2933280	2934280	What is that?
2934280	2936280	Do they could happen when they die?
2936280	2943280	I'm not actually sure I prescribe to any particular religion that has a heaven and hell, but if
2943280	2948280	that's what you want to tell yourself, Judy, then that's fine.
2948280	2959280	Okay, this possum was maybe named Stacy, and he went to heaven.
2959280	2962280	Okay, Judy, should we bury Stacy?
2962280	2965280	Yeah, can we bury Stacy?
2965280	2967280	Okay, does anyone ... Oh, wait, it's my car.
2967280	2972280	Let me go grab my cemetery shovel, and we'll scrape him off the pavement.
2972280	2974280	My God.
2974280	2978280	I love role-playing.
2978280	2982280	Okay, so you guys bury Stacey?
2982280	2983280	Stacy.
2983280	2984280	Davey.
2984280	2985280	Davey Stacey?
2985280	2989280	During the eulogy, I call him Davey.
2989280	2990280	Just to piss Judy off.
2990280	2993280	Just to remind that you don't care.
2993280	2999280	You look up, and you see that you are already in the parking lot of the Contingent Woods,
2999280	3004280	and looking around, you see five cars.
3004280	3008280	One car has a notice on the driver's side window taped to it.
3008280	3012280	Another car has a boot on one of the wheels.
3012280	3019280	There is also an old Bronco, like an SUV, got a lift kit on it, and it is right up next
3019280	3023280	to this little shack at the entrance, like the Park Ranger shack.
3023280	3033280	You would also notice a 91 Firebird that belongs to the older brother of Ash Hornbeam,
3033280	3038280	and you would know the older brother of Ash Hornbeam is like a party animal.
3038280	3044280	And then also, Judy, your mom's minivan.
3045280	3052280	Guys, I don't want to freak you out right now, but I'm pretty sure that's my mom's minivan
3052280	3054280	that's parked here.
3054280	3056280	Judy, why would that freak us out?
3056280	3059280	What if I get in trouble for being here?
3059280	3062280	You're 17 years old, Judy.
3062280	3066280	I know, but it's after 6.30 PM, which is my curfew.
3066280	3067280	My God.
3067280	3073280	You already told your mom you were staying the night at my house, so if I see Krista,
3074280	3078280	I'll shove you down into a ditch.
3078280	3079280	That would be really good.
3079280	3080280	Do you promise to shove me in the ditch?
3080280	3081280	Promise me.
3081280	3082280	I promise.
3082280	3086280	Pinky promise with my whole life and death and afterlife maybe.
3086280	3089280	I would love to shove you into a ditch right now.
3089280	3093280	Oh my God, Elizabeth, thank you for saying that.
3093280	3096280	Okay, if you promise, I'm totally fine, but then it's fine.
3096280	3098280	Okay, let's go.
3098280	3099280	Boo!
3099280	3102280	An old man jumps up toward you.
3102280	3103280	And says boo?
3103280	3104280	And says boo.
3104280	3105280	That's odd.
3105280	3106280	Okay.
3106280	3107280	Yeah.
3107280	3108280	Is it Halloween?
3108280	3109280	Nope, it is fall, but.
3109280	3110280	It's so spooky season, though.
3110280	3112280	It is spooky times.
3112280	3113280	Spooky times.
3113280	3120280	She is wearing a forest ranger uniform that is a state forest ranger uniform.
3120280	3127280	I believe Shadow, since she comes out here often and bathes in the moonlight nude.
3127280	3128280	Naked.
3128280	3129280	Typical.
3129280	3130280	Power giving.
3130280	3131280	Very cool.
3131280	3132280	Moonbeam, etc.
3132280	3135280	So, you would know that this is not the normal ranger.
3135280	3140280	Normally, there's a guy named Jeb who's a contention park ranger, but this is a different
3140280	3141280	guy.
3141280	3143280	And he says, hello there!
3143280	3151280	Ah, you can see here, the name is Woodrow and I am a forest ranger and I need you guys
3151280	3154280	to fill out some forms over here for me in the shack.
3155280	3158280	Did you decide to be a ranger because your name has wood in it?
3158280	3162280	That is 100% why I decided to become a ranger.
3162280	3163280	Interesting.
3163280	3164280	Anyway.
3164280	3166280	It was either that or a boat driver.
3166280	3171280	This is public property, so I think we're just going to be on our way.
3171280	3174280	So, she comes out here naked and dances.
3174280	3175280	This is Lindsey.
3175280	3182280	So, she comes out here and dances naked and Jeb is usually here for that?
3182280	3188280	Yeah, this is Zach and I think she probably goes deep into the woods before.
3188280	3190280	Yeah, I don't take my clothes off in the parking lot.
3190280	3193280	So, she sees Jeb before she gets naked.
3193280	3194280	That is what I assumed.
3194280	3195280	Pre and post nakedness.
3195280	3196280	I was a little disturbed.
3196280	3197280	Oh, okay.
3197280	3198280	Alright.
3198280	3199280	Pre and post, but not mid.
3199280	3200280	Not dirt.
3200280	3201280	Okay.
3201280	3202280	Yeah.
3202280	3203280	Alright.
3203280	3204280	Just making sure.
3204280	3205280	Only the squirrels and the trees.
3205280	3207280	My psyche was bothered.
3207280	3209280	I'm okay now.
3210280	3215280	So, if you wouldn't mind getting your camping gear and coming on up to fill out these forms
3215280	3220880	instead of barking at the knot, that would make me, you know, happy because it's my job
3220880	3222280	to get these forms filled out.
3222280	3225280	Don't put your real names, okay, girl?
3225280	3226280	Okay.
3226280	3227280	Right.
3227280	3231280	I'll just put, my name is Jude.
3231280	3233280	That's really good, Jude.
3233280	3237280	Right, but it's still with the Y, but it's pronounced different.
3237280	3243280	She runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs.
3243280	3244280	Ooh.
3249280	3257280	The sun, the sun, the sun is sleeping soon.
3257280	3275280	She knows, she knows, she knows that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance
3275280	3279280	beneath the shadow of the moon.
3279280	3307280	She moves, she moves, she moves with the howling wind.
3307280	3321280	The sun, the sun, the sun has come again, come again.
3321280	3331280	Her eyes, her eyes have seen it all.
3331280	3342280	The wonders of, the wonders of the shadow of the moon.
3361280	3366280	Moon.
