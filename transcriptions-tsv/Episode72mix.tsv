0	3080	Greetings, my chubby babies.
3080	6160	It's your thick fat daddy Wolf the dog,
6160	8760	here to slap, lap, and crap
8760	12080	right into your chunky little ear holes.
12080	16100	I, of course, am emanating from the basement.
16100	21100	694.2 PTBP, from the future to the past.
22860	26520	But the past is your present?
26520	29640	I don't know, time travel confuses me,
29640	32040	but I still do it constantly
32040	35760	because it makes my innards feel frisky.
35760	38040	Speaking of frisky business,
38040	40520	this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from
40520	44800	at Shemelan Shmusk, who tweeted about the show
44800	46840	and tagged that pretending pod.
46840	48360	It's that easy, y'all.
48360	50800	They right, hell yeah.
50800	53400	From Adam to Eric,
53400	56720	thank you for letting me know about this podcast.
56760	58360	It made the first few months
58360	61200	of baby Aurelia's life even better.
61200	64780	Recently, I took her to her six month checkup,
64780	69000	and after they gave her her shots, they cut my dick off.
69000	71140	Turns out it's actually pretty common.
71140	75200	We love you all the way from DC, DTF.
75200	78640	Well, Adam and Eric, I hope y'all have fun
78640	81160	running around dickless or whatever.
81160	85240	Do y'all know how they dispose of discarded dongs?
85240	90240	I sure do, and I'll never tell how or why I know
90680	95680	or what kind of wine goes best with a wok-fried wang.
96160	98660	Remember, if you think we deserve it,
98660	100720	spread around some internet love
100720	105000	by tagging at PretendingPod on Twitter and Instagram.

117920	122400	is to record another Q&A episode for this here main feed
122400	124760	that will be released quite soon,

142620	145000	Me, I'm tired of the past.
145840	147200	It's given me them blues.
147200	149600	Thank fuck this is the last broadcast
149600	152580	I'm blasting out old news.
152580	156760	Last episode, the PCs all signed some sort of paperwork
156760	159360	to partner with the calm, comfy campground
159360	162440	on something called Operation Hole Puncher
162440	166440	in a room filled with the flowers found all over the island.
166440	169000	The memories continued to bounce around,
169000	171480	from a cottage filled with security equipment
171480	173560	to the rounded-off meeting room
173560	176440	dealing with a broad woman and a scrawny man
176440	178180	who were attempting to spray them
178180	181760	with some sort of spray made from the flowers on the island.
181760	184160	Angela, when cornered and confused
184160	185880	by the actions of the group,
185880	190160	began chanting something strange and lost in translation.
190160	192400	With time being all finicky,
192400	195400	I'm assuming this may perhaps be the last time
195400	197660	I'm asked to choose a brand new track
197660	200520	to premiere on this audio cast.
200520	204400	And I've been saving this one for this perfect moment.
204400	207840	I have the distinct pleasure to present to each of you
207840	212680	for the very first time, Dream Girl with Pretty Sexual.
215680	218440	["Pretty Sexual"]
218440	221440	[" Working For You"]
221440	243520	["
243520	251920	Mr. Zach's Wild Bone."
251920	255240	Mr. Zach's Wild Bone.
255240	256240	Is that why...
256240	260520	Even though it won't be in the video.
260520	264240	People are like, what the fuck is this dialogue?
264240	266680	I want to get off Mr. Bone's wild ride.
266680	267680	Hi, Zach.
267680	268680	Hey, Joe.
268680	269680	Hey, Justin.
269680	270680	Go fuck yourself up.
270680	271680	That's nice.
271680	272680	Good burp, Luke.
272840	273840	You're being mean to me, Zach.
273840	275840	Oh, I don't think so, personally.
275840	277200	I personally do think so.
277200	278200	Oh, okay.
278200	279200	Personally.
279200	280840	Could you just give me a rundown of how I've been mean to you?
280840	282840	That way I can better myself?
282840	283840	No.
283840	285840	You called him ugly.
285840	287200	You called him stupid.
287200	289240	You hurt me emotionally.
289240	290440	You have been hitting him a lot.
290440	294360	Yeah, you just punch him in the shoulder like really hard all the time.
294360	301320	These are all fair, but do you have any real ones?
301320	302880	I like when you sit on my chest.
302880	306760	I don't like when you hurt me the other way.
306760	311800	Well, you should say the safe word, which is...
311800	312800	Papa Zechariah.
312800	316480	Oh, that's when I stopped.
316480	318640	Anything referring to me being a father?
318640	320640	No, I'm out.
320640	321640	Dad.
321640	322640	Dad.
322640	324560	Oh, no, dad.
324560	326560	Finish it.
326560	328560	Say daddy.
328560	332120	No, daddy is hot.
332120	333120	Dad is disturbing.
333120	336440	Yeah, that's why I want you to finish it so I can finish.
336440	337440	All right, so...
337440	339440	You're my male father figure.
339440	342880	Oh, okay.
342880	344680	We need to take this all out.
344680	345680	All of it?
345680	346680	Yeah.
346680	347680	Some of it.
347680	348680	Okay, let's start now.
348680	349680	Hey, Zech.
349680	350680	Hey, Joe.
350680	354880	Would you fuck, Justin?
354880	355880	Would I?
355880	356880	Have I?
356880	357880	Did I?
358200	361440	You had a rough middle school, didn't you?
361440	363160	Doesn't everybody have a rough middle school?
363160	364160	Nah.
364160	365160	Okay, well...
365160	368200	Nah, we're all super cool in middle school.
368200	370800	That's why we have a role-playing podcast.
370800	381040	Well, I'm glad you guys let me join you.
381040	382360	How's everyone's week going?
382360	384360	Better than middle school.
385360	387360	About the same as middle school.
387360	390040	It's a real middle school kind of week.
390040	394920	I get teased a lot by my peers.
394920	395920	Shut up, Justin.
395920	401840	I'm about to start spring break and then not have to go back to class afterwards, so that's
401840	402840	nice.
402840	403840	That's wild.
403840	404840	Pretty much.
404840	405840	Aren't you a little old to be in college?
405840	411360	Shouldn't you just quit like the rest of us?
411360	412360	Nah.
413360	414360	I like them young.
414360	415360	Oh, no.
415360	418360	My teacher's younger than me.
418360	419360	Oh, yeah.
419360	425360	You just like to learn from the people who are like the newest to the technology.
425360	430360	There's a creepy Tony LaRosa bobblehead licking down approvingly at Luke.
430360	432360	Hey, Tony.
432360	438360	I love the things you do.
438360	439360	Holy shit.
440360	445360	This is for five people in our listening audience, but have you guys seen the video of Tony LaRosa?
445360	446360	The DUI thing?
446360	450360	The DUI in Florida in the early 2000s.
450360	451360	No.
451360	452360	It's pretty good.
452360	453360	It's amazing.
453360	454360	I haven't.
454360	458360	Okay, Tony LaRosa, former manager of the St. Louis Cardinals.
458360	459360	Rip.
459360	460360	Rip.
460360	461360	Good team.
461360	462360	Yeah.
462360	463360	Anyway, he-
463360	464360	The MLB.
464360	465360	Oh, yeah.
465360	469360	He fell asleep at a stoplight in Florida during spring training.
469360	470360	What?
470360	472360	Just fell asleep, stopped in his car.
472360	478360	There's an interview with him at the police station where he's just wasted, and he's like,
478360	480360	do you know what I do?
480360	482360	I'm in professional baseball.
482360	484360	Oh, no.
487360	489360	Anyway, it's good shit.
489360	491360	That's super cool of him.
492360	494360	Well, God damn it.
494360	500360	He also took Albert Pools to that fucking Glenn Beck rally for America.
500360	501360	I didn't know that.
501360	502360	Yeah.
502360	503360	How did Albert feel about that?
503360	510360	No, that he was super into it because they're all rich, Christian.
510360	516360	The two sometimes go hand in hand, other times not, and today we're playing a role playing
516360	517360	game.
517360	518360	Are you sure?
518360	523360	Any of you who are just now joining us here on Pretending to Be People, let's give them
523360	524360	a quick rundown.
524360	526360	So on December 1st-
529360	533360	Bold of you to assume we remember the stories.
533360	535360	No, let's just do it real quick from start to finish.
535360	539360	I show up every day just like blank.
541360	543360	End of sentence.
544360	545360	I was curious.
545360	547360	All right, well, start blank today.
547360	549360	This is not a good start.
549360	554360	Walter and Alan Grimes in the lead, Charles Digby and Roger Fairfield in the middle, Bradley
554360	556360	Cooper and Jack Russell in the back.
556360	559360	You are all paddling for your lives.
559360	562360	I need everyone to roll a sanity.
565360	566360	I pass.
566360	567360	Failed, 94.
567360	568360	I pass.
569360	570360	On a-
570360	571360	Oh, no.
572360	573360	49.
573360	574360	Oh, shit.
574360	575360	99.
575360	576360	Yes.
576360	578360	That's a great success, right?
578360	579360	Almost 100.
579360	583360	Joe and Luke, if you guys could leave the room real quick.
583360	584360	Oh, no.
584360	585360	Don't leave.
585360	586360	He'll do bad things.
586360	587360	Luke, no.
587360	588360	Goodbye forever.
588360	590360	We're about to drown in this lake.
590360	591360	Oh, no.
591360	595360	No, we're about to get eaten by a big thing.
595360	597360	Or fully absorbed into the system.
597360	598360	Oh.
598360	599360	We'll start working against them.
599360	603360	You guys failed sanity, which means that you turn around now.
603360	604360	Sometimes it's a good thing.
604360	608360	That Martin Cupertino, you're actually in the same canoe as Jack Russell.
608360	614360	In the next canoe forward, we've got Charles Digby, who looks back just in time to see
614360	621360	an unspeakable worm-like abomination erupts above the surface of the water.
621360	625360	This thing rises 10 feet up out of the black inky darkness.
625360	632360	It is tube-like, covered in a squamous black partially translucent membrane.
632360	639360	Its body is segmented, and toxically green pulsating arteries and veins can be seen through
639360	641360	its thin-looking exterior.
641360	645360	It has no identifiable eyes or nose.
645360	652360	Its cavernous, circular mouths, one sitting just inside the other, are lined with hooked
652360	657360	teeth, and it spits out a saliva that is somehow darker than black.
657360	664360	From this maw, a sharp stylet protrudes, like something between a tongue and a noodle-like
664360	665360	needle.
665360	670360	It plunges down and attaches to the top of Jack Russell's head.
670360	676360	And then it rips him out of the back of the canoe, sucking the short, portly man up into
676360	683360	its round, teeth-encircled mouth, before slipping quickly and quietly back into the pitch-black
683360	686360	water of Lake Calm.
686360	689360	I need you both to roll a d8.
693360	694360	One.
694360	695360	Yeah.
695360	697360	Oh, what was that?
697360	698360	Squamous.
698360	699360	What was that?
699360	700360	Squamous.
700360	701360	Squamous.
701360	702360	Did I say it right?
702360	703360	I think you did.
703360	704360	I thought it was squamous.
704360	705360	I rolled a five.
705360	706360	Okay, so you lose five sanity.
706360	707360	Cool.
707360	712360	Martin Cupertino loses five sanity, and Charles Digby just loses one sanity.
712360	715360	You know, this can't be real.
715360	722360	Martin Cupertino, I need you to put in order fight, flight, and freeze from most likely
722360	723360	to least likely.
723360	725360	Flight, fight, and freeze.
725360	728360	Well, yeah, if he thinks he can't match it, flight.
728360	730360	If he has no choice, fight.
730360	732360	I think the last thing he would do is freeze.
732360	733360	Okay, sounds good.
733360	734360	So if you roll a one, you'll freeze.
734360	736360	If you roll a two or a three, you'll fight.
736360	738360	And if you roll a four, five, six.
738360	739360	On a d6?
739360	741360	You will flight.
741360	742360	Three, which is fight.
742360	743360	Fight.
743360	749360	This thing is all the way back down in the water, so you are now alone in your canoe,
749360	750360	ready to fight.
750360	752360	What do I have on me?
752360	754360	Do I have a syringe?
754360	756360	Do I have anything else?
756360	761360	You've got the map, and the syringe, and the cassettes.
761360	762360	Nice.
762360	769360	I unspool the cassettes and aim to choke the sea creature.
769360	776360	No, I think I get the syringe out, pokey, and in one hand, and he's ready.
776360	780360	This guy sucks, but he does know martial arts.
780360	781360	He knows it.
781360	783360	He can do it.
783360	787360	I don't like to say that he can, because he sucks, but he can do it.
787360	788360	He can do it.
788360	789360	He's pretty good at it.
789360	790360	So he's ready.
790360	791360	He's in the canoe.
791360	792360	Oh, my God.
792360	795360	He's just like, fuck you.
795360	797360	Fuck you, you worm piece of shit.
797360	801360	And if it's him or the worm, it's going to be him and the worm.
801360	802360	Okay.
802360	803360	Yeah, fuck yeah.
803360	808360	Then you'll get a bonus if it comes for you next.
808360	810360	Joe, Luke.
810360	811360	Fuck.
811360	812360	Joe, a microphone?
812360	815360	Do we say it in the mic?
815360	816360	Joe.
816360	818360	I'm sorry.
818360	821360	We're both sorry.
828360	829360	Walter Grimes.
829360	832360	You're still rowing and rowing, and Alan is like, we got to keep rowing.
832360	833360	We got to keep rowing.
833360	836360	So I need you to roll a strength or an athletics or swimming.
836360	840360	Walter succeeds on his check and does some good rows.
840360	841360	Walter does?
841360	842360	Or Alan does.
842360	843360	Sorry.
843360	844360	Walter fails.
844360	845360	Walter fails.
845360	846360	Okay, so you guys keep rowing.
846360	849360	You're getting almost to the shore on the opposite side.
849360	853360	You're very, very near the shore on the opposite side.
853360	858360	Roger Fairfield, you're in a canoe with Charles Digby who...
858360	861360	Roger, uh, uh, uh, uh.
861360	862360	We got to row.
862360	863360	We got to row.
863360	864360	We got to row.
864360	866360	He looks, I'm frozen staring behind us.
866360	867360	Oh shit.
867360	869360	I'll look behind me.
869360	876360	You look behind you just in time to see the water just kind of like, and there's nothing
876360	882360	there, including the nothingness that used to be Jack Russell, who is no longer in the
882360	883360	back of the canoe.
883360	887360	You just see Martin Cupertino by himself now.
887360	888360	And what is he doing?
888360	890360	Was he in front or back?
890360	891360	He was in back.
891360	892360	Let me just say that.
892360	893360	Sure.
893360	898360	Like he took time when they were fleeing at the start of this to say to Jack Russell,
898360	901360	like, no, I'm in back.
901360	902360	I steer.
902360	904360	It's the power position of a canoe.
904360	906360	So yeah, I mean like who was in back?
906360	907360	Me.
907360	908360	Okay.
908360	914320	So Jack Russell gets eaten and uh, I guess I've got to do everything myself and he paddles
914320	915320	that much harder.
915320	919240	So I need you all to roll, uh, Justin and Thomas, Martin Cupertino and Charles Digby
919240	922960	will be at a negative 20% for failing their sanity checks.
922960	923960	Okay.
923960	925120	I, I fail.
925120	927680	I would have passed except for that negative 20.
927680	928680	Yep.
928680	929680	What was I rolling?
929680	930680	Athletics?
930680	931680	Yeah.
931680	932680	Yeah.
932680	933680	I passed.
933680	934680	Oh wait.
934680	935680	Athletics.
935680	936680	I thought sanity.
936680	937680	No athletics.
937680	942400	Negative 25 minus 20 is 45 I pass 39.
942400	943400	I failed.
943400	948360	Am I just like, let's get the fuck out of here, Roger.
948360	951120	I don't like his little chart that I see over there.
951120	954520	I've got a little chart that they can see, so I'll just show it off.
954520	961520	But basically there are four blank boxes for each canoe and the Grimes have three boxes
961520	965060	marked off because they are the closest to the shore.
965060	969180	And then Fairfield and Digby in a canoe have two out of the four boxes checked.
969180	970180	Oh no.
970180	972180	I thought most boxes was worse.
972180	974180	Turns out it's good.
974180	975860	The least boxes checked.
975860	980100	Martin Cupertino just has one box checked out of four to get to the other side.
980100	981120	Well, that makes sense.
981120	987820	At this point, I'm going to roll a D six to decide as the water around all of you begins
987820	994620	to move and something massive underneath is choosing its next target.
994620	999220	We're going to say a Cooper Martin Cupertino.
999220	1000220	You're one.
1000220	1002680	Uh, we got, you're rolling a D six.
1002680	1004260	I'm rolling a D six.
1004260	1006340	Roger Fairfield is two.
1006340	1008340	Charles Digby is three.
1008340	1009980	Walter Grimes is four.
1009980	1014500	Alan Grimes is five, six re-roll miss.
1014500	1015500	It stays dormant.
1015500	1016500	How about that?
1016500	1017500	A good option.
1017500	1018500	I'm, I'm four.
1018500	1019500	I don't know.
1019500	1023220	Which dice did you just roll?
1023220	1024220	It's a one.
1024220	1025220	Martin.
1025220	1027980	That's Martin Cupertino.
1027980	1029820	So the water around you.
1029820	1030820	Shit.
1030820	1031820	Wow.
1031820	1033820	Jack just built a whole cocktail.
1033820	1038300	Hey, it looks okay.
1038300	1043220	We were in a real tense moment.
1043220	1048380	There's another ice cube.
1048380	1049380	We got him a sippy cup.
1049380	1052940	I got a closed lid on that there, bud.
1052940	1056540	Have you been recording our casual conversation this whole time?
1056540	1060380	No, he just, that is, that is from the country.
1060380	1061660	That is from the country.
1061660	1062660	Praise.
1062660	1064380	No, I'm back.
1064380	1071780	So that noise that you just heard was me spilling my drink all over myself and over a lot of
1071780	1072780	XLR cables.
1072780	1077940	That's what he calls simultaneously coming pissing and shitting his pants.
1077940	1078940	Typical Zach.
1078940	1081220	Spilled my drink.
1081220	1084780	My cochlea just exploded everywhere.
1084780	1085780	That's what it's called, right?
1085780	1086780	No, you're close.
1086780	1087780	You're very close.
1087780	1088780	It's Ploweka.
1088780	1091780	That's what it's called, right?
1091780	1092900	So, implant.
1092900	1102700	So it's not often that, all right, so piss, shit, and jizz just spewed out of Zach's ears.
1102700	1105420	All right, shit.
1105420	1112540	Okay, so it's not often that I would do this, but it makes sense that in that moment I'm
1112540	1117820	going to use my actual actions instead of my dice roll.
1117820	1125140	I had just rolled a one on your actual, I don't know what you mean, this giant abomination
1125140	1131180	coming for Martin Cupertino, but I was reaching for my dice to roll that attack.
1131180	1136380	So instead of that attack roll, I'm going to use the fumble because Zach fumbled my
1136380	1138500	attempt to grab the dice.
1138500	1139500	Gotcha.
1139500	1140500	Yeah.
1140500	1141500	You blundered.
1141500	1145020	I blundered and therefore- Our actions in this world affect their world.
1145020	1146020	Oh my God.
1146020	1148060	That's too much responsibility.
1148060	1152100	If we kill Zach, he can't do any bad stuff to us anymore.
1152100	1153100	Oh no.
1153100	1155300	He couldn't do any good stuff either.
1155300	1156300	Oh.
1156300	1157300	That's true.
1157300	1158300	When has he?
1158300	1159300	Aw.
1159300	1160300	Aw.
1160420	1161420	Not true.
1161420	1163420	He flosses before every session.
1163420	1166580	Like a big old silk pillow.
1166580	1169380	So basically you all- Body pillow.
1169380	1175900	Turn around just in time to see this absolute tube-like creature comes 10 feet out of the
1175900	1177540	water- And spills its drink.
1177540	1184820	And spills its drink all over, so actually- Shit.
1184820	1189660	So what happens is the Grimes and Roger Fairfield haven't seen this yet, so I'll describe it
1189660	1192820	once again, but it rises 10 feet out of the water.
1192820	1199440	It is an unspeakable worm-like abomination, tube-like, covered in squamous black partially
1199440	1201660	translucent membrane.
1201660	1207860	Its body is segmented and toxically green pulsating arteries and veins can be seen through
1207860	1210340	its thin looking exterior.
1210340	1213660	It has no identifiable eyes or nose.
1213660	1219440	Its cavernous circular mouths, one sitting just inside the other, are lined with hooked
1219440	1224000	teeth and it spits out a saliva that is somehow darker than black.
1224000	1230720	And actually, instead of going for an attack on Martin Cupertino, all of this spit comes
1230720	1234280	out and just lands all over the canoe.
1234280	1240880	You can roll a dodge or a dexterity to try to avoid this goop getting all over you.
1240880	1242200	Didn't you say it already failed?
1242200	1244520	Yeah, it failed- But it vomited.
1244520	1247560	Literally grabbing you and- Doing a bad.
1247560	1248560	Pulling you in.
1248680	1250160	It just gaks.
1250160	1251720	It does what Zach did.
1251720	1255920	Okay, I got a 61.
1255920	1258280	Roll athletics since that's a 65.
1258280	1259280	There you go.
1259280	1263780	So you swiftly move in this canoe from the back up to the front real quick.
1263780	1270060	As the back gets completely drenched in this goop that is blacker than the water of Lake
1270060	1276560	Calm, which you thought was already so dark that it basically pulled light away from the
1276560	1281880	viewer's eyes and you guys can roll again to try to paddle away.
1281880	1285440	Roger, pull it together.
1285440	1287160	Athletics or what?
1287160	1288160	Anything that'll work.
1288160	1289160	So swimming, athletics.
1289160	1290160	Pass.
1290160	1291160	42.
1291160	1293960	I was hoping I could say, you got it, bud, but I failed again.
1293960	1297280	As I'm telling him to pull it together, I also failed more.
1297280	1298760	I'm like, oh, cramp.
1298760	1300600	So you guys both failed?
1300600	1301600	Yeah.
1301720	1308840	So as this goop just gets all over the back of Martin Cupertino's canoe, he jumps back
1308840	1314080	and keeps paddling from the front with such a swiftness that he pulls up even with Roger
1314080	1316120	Fairfield and Charles Digby.
1316120	1321920	Just huge plunging drives into the water as he's fucking crewing it.
1321920	1323380	Swiftly moving, yeah.
1323380	1326320	Swiftly through the water in perfect, literally-
1326320	1327320	Stroke.
1327320	1328320	Stroke.
1328320	1329320	Stroke.
1329320	1330320	Stroke.
1330320	1331320	He's saying that.
1332040	1333040	We got to do it like that.
1333040	1334040	My arms hurt.
1334040	1335040	He's going to hear sticks.
1335040	1340920	So the Grimes actually reach the shore on the other side and immediately Alan's like,
1340920	1343800	we got to get up onto the shore.
1343800	1346600	And he's trying to pull the canoe up onto the-
1346600	1352120	I'll grab underneath where I was sitting and just, yeah, sprint, bringing it up on shore.
1352120	1353920	And you guys are up on the shore.
1353920	1358400	Now we've got three people in the water, so I'm going to roll another D6.
1359120	1362680	Oh God, I'm so nervous to like move.
1362680	1364120	Need a cup holder for you.
1364120	1370440	All right, so one and two are going to be Martin Cupertino, three and four is Roger
1370440	1374480	Fairfield, and five and six is Charles Digby.
1374480	1375480	Cocked.
1375480	1377640	Crack die.
1377640	1378640	That's a two.
1378640	1379640	Two correct die.
1379640	1380640	Who is two?
1380640	1382740	Martin Cupertino.
1382740	1383740	This thing hates him.
1383740	1386320	Quit being mean to Tommy.
1386320	1390400	I mean, Martin is the one who should be.
1390400	1391400	Yeah.
1391400	1395120	This thing's coming for you.
1395120	1399140	Just jump, like comes out of the water, almost like a proboscis, but like something from
1399140	1403980	inside its maw is coming toward you and is trying to attach to the top of your head.
1403980	1409320	How are you going to try to dissuade it from taking you into itself?
1409320	1413880	I reach back behind me and grab the now departed Jack Russell's paddle.
1413880	1416520	Actually, it would be right next to me because he was in front.
1416520	1417520	Exactly.
1417520	1420520	I grab that and I just try to shove it up the maw instead of my head.
1420520	1421520	Absolutely.
1421520	1422520	Okay.
1422520	1428360	So go ahead and roll melee weapons or karate.
1428360	1431240	I think I actually do have a martial arts skill.
1431240	1433800	Where is it?
1433800	1435640	If you wrote it in, it'd be on the left.
1435640	1437000	Was it just your unarmed combat?
1437000	1438720	It is my unarmed combat.
1438720	1442120	Can I roll athletics or actually no, melee is better.
1442120	1443120	Melee.
1443360	1444360	Melee.
1444360	1446360	Meal worm weapons.
1446360	1447360	Yes.
1447360	1450000	50 on a 50.
1450000	1451480	I rolled a 10.
1451480	1452480	So you win.
1452480	1453480	Yeah.
1453480	1458240	So as this thing comes down, this like noodle like needle coming out of the middle of its
1458240	1463600	circular vast mouth is like trying to fight its way through.
1463600	1469920	So Martin Cupertino with his left hand is still plunging his paddle into the water.
1469920	1470920	Left.
1470920	1471920	Right.
1471920	1472920	Left.
1472920	1473920	Right.
1473920	1479360	And he reaches behind him for the paddle of the departed Jack Russell.
1479360	1484800	And he just like jams it straight into the air behind him at where he thinks the mouth
1484800	1485800	is.
1485800	1489240	And it just happened to be the moment where this proboscis was coming in straight at your
1489240	1490240	head.
1490240	1496280	You knock it back and as the maw like gets pulled down with this weird style that's protruding
1496280	1497800	from its mouth.
1497800	1506960	You like jam the or in sideways like in star Wars when Luke gets the in the compactor.
1506960	1507960	Yes.
1507960	1508960	No.
1508960	1509960	In the mouth.
1509960	1510960	The rain core.
1510960	1511960	The rain core.
1511960	1512960	Yeah.
1512960	1513960	I keep its jaws open.
1513960	1514960	Yeah.
1514960	1515960	Yeah.
1515960	1516960	And it lets it lets out this.
1516960	1525360	That might be a really cool OS startup sound.
1525360	1528760	But he's now he's now he's paddling with both hands.
1528760	1529760	All right.
1529760	1532000	Everybody roll athletics except for Luke.
1532000	1533000	You're good.
1533000	1534000	You're safe.
1534000	1535000	Can I pass 16?
1535000	1536000	Yeah, absolutely.
1536000	1538380	As they're rowing and rowing, what are the Grimes doing?
1538380	1539380	I pick up.
1539380	1545260	I want to find a medium sized rock that's like kind of sharp and I'm going to skip it
1545260	1546800	at the monster.
1546800	1547800	Fantastic.
1547800	1552560	So you'll do that to help aid if it's coming at someone on the next attack.
1552560	1553800	Roger fails again.
1554320	1557560	For every one of these, I rolled a 92, a 93, and a 96.
1557560	1558560	Oh my God.
1558560	1561920	Roger Fairfield can't canoe to save his God damn life.
1561920	1562920	I mean, literally.
1562920	1563920	He really can't.
1563920	1564920	He rolled a 92, 93, and 94.
1564920	1565920	I know.
1565920	1566920	I know.
1566920	1567920	Why didn't you lie?
1567920	1568920	I should have lied.
1568920	1569920	I should have lied.
1569920	1570920	I passed.
1570920	1571920	Hang on.
1571920	1572920	Let's go back.
1572920	1573920	It was a 92, a 93, and a 94.
1573920	1574920	Roll again.
1574920	1575920	We'll do everything for you.
1575920	1576920	I passed as well.
1576920	1577920	All right.
1577920	1582840	So Fairfield Digby and Martin Cupertino, the canoes are side by side at this point and
1582880	1589480	you guys are one success away from being safe on the shore on the other side as this water
1589480	1595880	moves and you feel the canoes, both of your canoes just kind of like lift up a little
1595880	1598160	bit as you're rowing.
1598160	1604600	One two for Martin Cupertino, three four for Roger Fairfield, five six for Charles Digby.
1604600	1606140	That's a four.
1606140	1607420	That's Roger Fairfield.
1607420	1608920	You deserve it.
1608920	1609920	Okay.
1610000	1616040	So first, as this thing is coming, as this thing is coming up out of the water, I want
1616040	1620800	to roll from Walter Grimes for skipping a rock.
1620800	1621800	Whatever it is.
1621800	1623740	It's a 98, so I fail.
1623740	1626480	The rock is too big and it skips twice and then it flunks.
1626480	1627480	You just drop it.
1627480	1628480	My wrist.
1628480	1629480	Ow, my hand.
1629480	1630480	Yeah, no.
1630480	1642880	Alan will take a page out of your book and try to do the same thing.
1642880	1648280	And he too fails, so there will be no assist on this, Joe.
1648280	1656600	So as this thing is coming up out of the water, emitting this weird, almost green, almost
1656600	1660720	dark, just like liquid that is all over its body.
1660720	1667400	It's actually like an oil now that is covering the top of Lake Calm surrounding you.
1667400	1671420	And it is coming down straight for your head.
1671420	1672840	What are you doing?
1672840	1676840	Having seen Martin just handle it with his oar, I'm going to try and if it's coming straight
1676840	1681000	down at me, I want to knock it like a baseball bat would be knocking a ball out of the air.
1681000	1682000	Absolutely.
1682000	1683000	Go ahead and roll.
1683000	1684560	Is that melee or unarmed?
1684560	1689000	That'll be melee.
1689000	1691000	You mean that thing I don't have?
1691000	1694120	A ninety-two.
1694120	1698160	I'm going to use, this is the third set of dice I've used, but I'm going to change the
1698160	1699160	dice again.
1699160	1700160	Let him re-roll.
1700160	1701160	Let him re-roll.
1701160	1706360	I rolled an eighty-four, so I failed.
1706360	1714880	And so as this water beast rises up and comes down toward you, you bat away just enough,
1714880	1720520	kind of throws it off its trajectory, and the proboscis goes right into the canoe in
1720520	1725900	between you and Charles Digby, and it actually punctures into the canoe, so you'll both take
1725900	1731320	a negative twenty percent on your next athletics checks to try to get to the safety of the
1731320	1732320	shore.
1732320	1733320	Wonderful.
1733320	1734320	Now you're taking me down with you hun.
1735280	1744880	But it is now back under the water, and you guys are rowing for your lives.
1744880	1746120	I finally pass one.
1746120	1747320	I get a forty-three.
1747320	1748880	But wait, with your minus twenty percent?
1748880	1749880	I don't pass.
1749880	1750880	Fuck!
1750880	1753880	Well, me neither.
1753880	1754880	Shit.
1754880	1756600	It doesn't really matter.
1756600	1758320	Wait, is this good or bad?
1758320	1759320	This is bad.
1759320	1760320	You know it's terrible.
1760320	1761320	You rolled a one hundred.
1761320	1762320	Yeah, I rolled a one hundred.
1762320	1763320	I rolled a one hundred.
1763320	1764320	A one zero zero.
1764320	1765320	Yep, that's a hundred.
1765320	1766320	Aw.
1766320	1767320	Wait, did you say you rolled a ninety-six?
1767320	1768320	Okay.
1768320	1769320	Earlier?
1769320	1770320	Earlier, yeah.
1770320	1771320	A one zero zero.
1771320	1772320	That should have been a crit fail.
1772320	1774000	A one zero zero is a no.
1774000	1775000	Did we make that rule?
1775000	1776000	I forgot about that.
1776000	1780280	Yeah, it's the opposite of sixty-nine.
1780280	1788960	Martin Cupertino will actually lose one of his successes on that, so Fairfield and Digby
1788960	1794680	take the, uh, we're going into, like, percentiles of how much land is left between you and the
1794680	1800360	shore, and you guys still have one success left, but now Martin Cupertino needs two or
1800360	1806640	one critical success in order to make it to the shore as the water around you begins to
1806640	1807640	bubble.
1807640	1809920	I don't like this new mechanic, because it's scary.
1809920	1813000	This chase, this water monster chase mechanic?
1813000	1814000	Yeah.
1814000	1818200	Well, tough shit, because it's going to come up in every situation from now on.
1819200	1820600	That's a five.
1820600	1822920	That's Charles Digby is getting it this time.
1822920	1823920	No.
1823920	1825920	Like, good getting it, or?
1825920	1826920	No.
1826920	1828520	Charles Digby's getting it.
1828520	1829520	Getting it.
1829520	1831800	Charles Digby can get it.
1831800	1834000	Let's see if Charles Digby can get it.
1834000	1835000	What do I need to roll?
1835000	1839960	You need to roll whatever you're going to do to try to avoid getting sucked up into
1839960	1842520	the worm.
1842520	1843960	The water worm.
1843960	1845680	Can I just, like, aggressively paddle forward?
1846160	1847440	The thickest can beat the worm.
1847440	1852560	It would freak out and be, like, to try and get out of its, like, path or-
1852560	1854160	Yeah, you would have to-
1854160	1855720	Would I still get my decrease, though?
1855720	1856720	Yes, you would.
1856720	1859760	Okay, then I won't do that, because that will be hard.
1859760	1863360	I mean, I'm not going to talk into my mic anymore.
1863360	1867040	I'm just going to move all the way over here.
1867040	1869560	A sharp tongue is coming at you currently.
1869560	1870560	What are you doing?
1870560	1873400	I think I'd probably want to do, like, a similar thing, where, like, I want to bat it away
1873400	1874400	with the paddle.
1874840	1876840	Are they, like, big, sturdy paddles I'm assuming?
1876840	1880080	Yeah, I mean, it's not original, but it has worked, so let's give it a go.
1880080	1882440	I don't have any fucking other stuff to use.
1882440	1883440	I know.
1883440	1885440	I was trying to come up with something original, too, and I couldn't-
1885440	1886440	You're stuck up on the water.
1886440	1889440	It doesn't lend itself, so give it a go.
1889440	1890440	Okay.
1893080	1894080	I rolled a 4.
1894080	1895560	I rolled a 22.
1895560	1899160	I rolled a 29 for my rocks skipping.
1899160	1900160	Oh, nice.
1900160	1901160	Unfortunately-
1901920	1904520	This is a very loyal little robot boy.
1904520	1907800	That won't be able to help as-
1907800	1910720	So it skips over and hits the worm, and nothing happens.
1910720	1915520	Yeah, it actually hits the worm, and it's got a really thin exterior, and so you see
1915520	1922120	one of the arteries of this thing just, like, flops out of the skin, and this toxically
1922120	1926960	green, like, liquid begins pouring on top of Lake Calm.
1926960	1927960	Can I roll damage?
1927960	1928960	Sure.
1928960	1930600	What'd I roll?
1931040	1932040	A rock.
1932040	1933040	D4.
1933040	1934040	D4.
1934040	1936040	A tiny boy.
1936040	1937320	2.
1937320	1939440	Fuck you, worm.
1939440	1943080	And it lets out a little, like, little one.
1943080	1944080	Just a little guy.
1944080	1945080	Just a little guy.
1945080	1946080	Just a little guy.
1946080	1947080	However-
1947080	1949520	Can Alan help, too?
1949520	1953720	Help me throw every rock he can find.
1953720	1954720	He failed.
1954720	1955720	Oh.
1955720	1956720	Fuck you, Alan.
1957400	1963560	As Charles Digby just yells, fuck you, Alan, this sharp stylet protrudes, and it's this
1963560	1972360	tongue, noodle-like needle plunges down and attaches to the top of Charles Digby's head,
1972360	1977560	and it is ripping you up into its maw currently.
1977560	1983560	You guys have one action to try to fix this, otherwise he's going into this creature.
1983560	1985880	Well, Roger's gonna try and pull him down.
1985880	1986880	All right.
1986880	1988680	And what is Martin Cupertino doing?
1988680	1990040	What is Walter Grimes doing?
1990040	1992040	Growing, for sure.
1992040	1995160	I just threw the rock, and I'm picking another one up.
1995160	1999160	I'd like to use this opportunity to get another box checked on them.
1999160	2000840	Okay, yeah, you can.
2000840	2003840	So go ahead and roll.
2003840	2004840	97.
2004840	2005840	97.
2005840	2007840	The roll.
2007840	2015000	He's rolling backwards, because he's too shocked to think.
2015000	2017000	I'm gonna roll strength.
2017000	2022760	And I will roll strength against you, which is an 80.
2022760	2027680	Well, that's a five.
2027680	2029880	Oh my God, he rolled a three.
2029880	2031680	That's a three.
2031680	2032680	Yeah.
2032680	2033680	Incredible.
2033680	2035680	Holy shit.
2035680	2036680	Absolutely incredible.
2036680	2039680	Holy shit.
2039680	2044960	Charles Digby, as this thing has you by the top of the head, it's literally pulling you
2044960	2047800	up and you're five feet off the ground.
2047800	2054240	The only thing keeping you connected to this canoe is Roger Fairfield, who has hands on
2054240	2059840	both of your feet and is just in a tug of war with a giant Xenonema toad.
2059840	2063280	And he's just pulling and pulling, and this thing's pulling at your head.
2063280	2065360	I need you to roll a constitution.
2065360	2068480	I also like to think I'm trying to punch it in the head.
2068480	2069480	Yes.
2069480	2071480	I'm just like, fuck off.
2071480	2072480	Constitution.
2072480	2073480	Oh, good.
2074000	2076000	That's not super high.
2076000	2077000	I pass.
2077000	2078680	53 on a 55.
2078680	2084720	You feel your spine literally is trying to disconnect itself as this thing is pulling
2084720	2092760	you apart and you reach up and grab onto this thing's tongue just in time before it snapped
2092760	2097600	your spinal cord and ripped your head off of the rest of your body.
2097600	2103700	You and Roger Fairfield together just like snap this thing off your head.
2103700	2106440	You are now, what was your hair situation like before?
2106440	2109240	It was, I'm just, you know, short brown hair.
2109240	2114280	You know that sketch from I Think You Should Leave where you can hire someone dressed in
2114280	2119240	a gorilla costume to come rip your toupee off?
2119240	2123040	Well that happens and you get scalped.
2123040	2124920	You hired a nematode.
2124920	2131040	Your head is bleeding to the point to where your eyes are having trouble seeing through
2131040	2139280	the Goldeneye style blood rushing down your face, but your back just popped in the best
2139280	2140280	way.
2140280	2141880	You decompressed my spine, bro.
2141880	2142960	Thanks dude.
2142960	2146240	And as it pops off, it flings itself backward.
2146240	2151480	It was putting so much into it that it just rips backward into the water as it falls backwards
2151480	2159720	and you fall onto Roger Fairfield in the canoe safe for now but bleeding all over everything.
2159720	2163200	Is it like if George Costanza got like a head wound right on top?
2163200	2164200	Yes.
2164200	2165200	Like they have the little sides?
2165200	2166200	Yeah.
2166200	2167200	You're Costanz-ing.
2167200	2176680	However, where the bald spot is is just raw blood and like skin that is like three layers
2176680	2180760	less than it was epithelially speaking.
2180760	2183360	I got to piss.
2183360	2184360	Oh, thank you, Joe.
2184360	2185360	I got you, man.
2185360	2186360	Thank you, Joe.
2186360	2187360	I love you.
2187360	2191360	Dude, speaking of Costanza.
2191360	2200240	For just imminent consumption, dirty Hershey's.
2200240	2201240	Dirty Hershey's.
2201240	2202240	Y'all heard about that dirty Hershey's?
2202240	2203240	Those Hershey's clerks.
2203240	2208040	Dude, dirty Hershey's is my favorite rapper and it's also me.
2208040	2209040	I'm dirty Hershey's.
2209040	2213000	Yeah, I'm definitely going to call every bout of diarrhea from now on.
2213000	2214000	Dirty Hershey's.
2214000	2215000	Dirty Hershey's.
2215000	2220680	That's what I call other Eagles fans who are from Hershey, Pennsylvania.
2220680	2222680	It was too far.
2222680	2223680	I got it.
2223680	2224680	It was too far.
2224680	2225680	Elbow bump.
2225680	2226680	Elbow bump.
2226680	2227680	I mean, you can get it but it doesn't make it good.
2227680	2228680	Thank you.
2228680	2229680	Did you hit record?
2229680	2230680	Yes, I did.
2230680	2231680	Are you sure?
2231680	2237520	You want to try again after that Hershey, Pennsylvania joke?
2238040	2241080	Yeah, I don't want to miss out on dirty Hersh.
2241080	2244760	As this thing flops back and just lands in the water.
2244760	2246880	How dong-like is this thing?
2246880	2247880	That's what I was thinking.
2247880	2250400	It's pretty dong-like.
2250400	2251720	Just the dong flapping around.
2251720	2257480	Have you ever opened your penis hole and it looks like weird little lips?
2257480	2259720	Is that what its mouth looks like?
2259720	2260720	Ow.
2260720	2265240	It's like a urethra with multiple circular teeth all inside of it.
2265240	2269320	Do you guys have dick teeth?
2269320	2270320	How do you forget?
2270320	2272200	Do you guys have tails?
2272200	2280200	How do you process the urine crystals if you don't have dick teeth?
2280200	2285680	Bradley Cooper, Charles Digby, Walter and Alan Grimes, and Roger Fairfield, you are
2285680	2294360	all standing in the room where you met for orientation and two steps forward, three steps
2294360	2295360	backward.
2295360	2297360	Oh, wait.
2297360	2301520	How are we supposed to feel motivated to escape this creature on the lake, Zach?
2301520	2306680	You don't know how to feel about anything currently because your mind is being moved
2306680	2309480	from place to place so constantly.
2309480	2311360	Where's everyone at mentally?
2311360	2312360	Which room are we in?
2312360	2313360	I'm on the lake.
2313360	2314440	I'm still on the lake.
2314440	2318440	And yet you're standing in this room and you have this spray bottle in your hand.
2318440	2319440	Which room are we in again?
2319440	2320440	The meeting room.
2320440	2322520	And did Angela just close the door on us?
2322520	2323960	Well, Angela's not in here.
2323960	2327800	I know, but does it feel like the time when she just closed the door on us?
2327800	2328800	I don't know.
2328800	2331200	I think the whole point is to determine that sort of thing.
2331200	2332200	Do you?
2332200	2333200	Okay.
2333200	2334200	Well, okay.
2334200	2335560	I've got the spray bottle in my hand.
2335560	2340520	I'm kicking open the outside door and I'm looking for any motherfucker who works here
2340520	2341520	to spray.
2341520	2345440	As you kick out the outside door, you guys all look out and you see that it is completely
2345440	2346440	empty.
2346440	2351260	You see that there is the desk on your left and there's the water cooler with the coffee
2351260	2355080	machine on your right and it is dead silent and there's no one around.
2355080	2356080	I want to look at Charles.
2356080	2357080	Is he scalped?
2357080	2358080	No.
2358080	2360580	Do I remember that I got scalped?
2360580	2361580	Yes.
2361580	2362580	I'm like...
2362580	2363580	Oh, sorry.
2363580	2369020	As you poke at your head, you feel just immense pain rushing through like the back, your back.
2369020	2370020	Like it's just like...
2370020	2371900	The memory of pain or...
2371900	2376500	Like yeah, it's like an idea of pain that is just like streaming down your back and
2376500	2377500	yet you feel hair.
2377500	2379700	And I look at Roger and I'm like, am I...
2379700	2380700	No, you're fine.
2380700	2381700	You're fine.
2381700	2382700	You're fine.
2382700	2383700	You're fine.
2383700	2384700	And then I'm like...
2384700	2388700	I can like feel my fucking back just rushing with pain.
2388700	2390180	I'm like, oh, my fucking back.
2390180	2392100	And I'm like, look, look, look at it.
2392100	2393100	Look at it.
2393100	2394100	And I like lift the back...
2394100	2395100	My back shirt up.
2395100	2396100	I look at it.
2396100	2397100	It's fine.
2397100	2398100	You're fine.
2398100	2399100	You're fine.
2399100	2400100	You're fine.
2400100	2401100	You're fine.
2401100	2402100	Calm down.
2402100	2403100	Calm down.
2403100	2404100	You're fine.
2404100	2405100	Oh, God.
2405100	2406100	As you lift it up though, you do notice that you have the little mark on the inside of
2406100	2407100	your elbow pit.
2407100	2408100	Oh, fuck.
2408100	2409100	Do you...
2409100	2410100	Do you...
2410500	2411500	Do you have this?
2411500	2412500	I...
2412500	2413500	I...
2413500	2414500	I still do.
2414500	2415500	Yeah.
2415500	2416500	Yeah.
2416500	2417500	We tried.
2417500	2418500	We...
2418500	2419500	Walter and I, we were throwing rocks.
2419500	2420500	We were trying to...
2420500	2421500	I think we're saved.
2421500	2422500	I don't...
2422500	2423500	Alan, do you have a mark?
2423500	2428860	And he holds up his arm and pulls up his shirt and there's a mark on the inside, little blood
2428860	2430360	dried up.
2430360	2434620	I want to run behind the desk and see if there's a gun underneath.
2434620	2436660	Roll search.
2436660	2438620	Fail.
2438620	2439960	You do not find a gun.
2440820	2444820	There's no gun there, so you do find a gun.
2444820	2447680	This game's wild.
2447680	2450400	I have a question to ask Zach that they shouldn't listen to.
2450400	2451400	Oh, okay.
2451400	2452400	Take your headphones off, I guess.
2452400	2453400	Thomas.
2453400	2455000	Why don't you just ask him?
2455000	2457720	Is it my first time again or is that...
2457720	2458720	No.
2458720	2459720	You remember everything.
2459720	2460720	You're back.
2460720	2464060	What did you touch?
2464060	2468240	And that echoes in your ear of Jack Russell saying, what did...
2468240	2469920	What did you touch?
2469920	2470920	What did you touch?
2470920	2471920	There you go.
2471920	2472920	That was nice.
2472920	2473920	What did you touch?
2473920	2475920	Just echo, echo, echo.
2475920	2476920	Is he in the room?
2476920	2477920	Nope.
2477920	2479260	Is there any kind of...
2479260	2480480	Can I roll some kind of...
2480480	2482840	Why, just spill your beans.
2482840	2486400	Can I roll some kind of search to see if there's been a trace of someone in here or does it
2486400	2487720	look totally untouched?
2487720	2491220	It's not that it's abandoned, but there's just no one in here right now.
2491220	2496640	It's as if when you first came in to a calm, comfy campground, there was no one in the
2496640	2497640	lobby.
2497640	2498760	It's exactly like that.
2498760	2501800	Is there any other kind of search role I can also do for anything?
2501800	2505840	Well, if you're wanting to find something, you could roll search if you'd tell me what
2505840	2506840	you're trying to find.
2506840	2509480	Oh, then no.
2509480	2512560	I'm searching the secret places for something interesting.
2512560	2518920	Oh, can I search for the McGuffin to solve all those problems?
2518920	2522480	I'd like to find the Maltese Falcon, please.
2522480	2524040	Oh, I didn't...
2524040	2528320	Oh, no, I got a 69, which does that a crit success?
2528320	2530320	That is a crit success.
2530320	2531320	Crit success.
2531320	2532320	Whatever this is.
2532320	2533320	Okay, yeah.
2533320	2541280	So Charles Digby is looking all around, and he finds a tape with James saying, here's
2541280	2543080	what's going on.
2543080	2550920	Well, distraught, you put your hand up against the wall, and you feel the wall begin to give
2550920	2554680	way a little bit as you found this secret door.
2554700	2562920	And as you push into it, this room opens up, and looking into it, it is a long, long room.
2562920	2568080	You can't see the end of it, and it is lit by the floor, and the darkness is coming from
2568080	2574120	above, and there's these shadows of all these metal shelves, and you have opened up a secret
2574120	2577080	door into the room with all the tapes.
2577080	2579280	Geographically, where is this room?
2579280	2581200	It's just around the corner from the meeting room.
2581200	2584880	It was down a slight hallway from where you guys were.
2584880	2588160	Sure, but if the island is the face of the clock, what time is it at?
2588160	2589160	We're in the center.
2589160	2590160	Two o'clock.
2590160	2591160	Aren't we?
2591160	2592160	What?
2592160	2593160	It's at two o'clock from the center?
2593160	2594160	It doesn't matter.
2594160	2598280	Then why is the island the face of the clock?
2598280	2602440	This is all you've given us.
2602440	2604400	Can I roll to see if I have my tape player on me?
2604400	2605400	Yeah.
2605400	2606400	Luck?
2606400	2607400	Yeah, 50-50.
2607400	2608400	I don't.
2608600	2609600	What?
2609600	2610600	Aww.
2610600	2611600	This is that room.
2611600	2612600	This is that room.
2612600	2613600	We were in here before.
2613600	2614600	Do you guys remember that?
2614600	2619600	Do you remember the room with all the tapes?
2619600	2620600	I remember.
2620600	2622720	We should find a way to play one.
2622720	2624440	Yeah, I want to go further in.
2624440	2625760	Are you guys all going further in?
2625760	2629400	Can I search for a tape player, like, in the office or something?
2629400	2634280	We're not, because Martin Cupertino has continued to run out the front door, and he's running
2634280	2635280	towards the boat docks.
2635280	2636600	What are the rest of you doing?
2636600	2637880	Searching for a tape player.
2638360	2641240	As you look around, it's just shelves, shelves, shelves, shelves.
2641240	2642240	I don't know.
2642240	2644040	I want to try and find our shelves again.
2644040	2645040	Yeah, I'll go with it.
2645040	2646280	Or is it so gargantuan?
2646280	2649120	I mean, looking into it, it is infinite and vast.
2649120	2650120	Oh, okay.
2650120	2651600	But you can try if you want.
2651600	2652760	Roger Fairfield, what are you doing?
2652760	2653760	I don't know.
2653760	2656080	I don't know what Roger would do right now.
2656080	2657600	He's freaked out, but he doesn't...
2657600	2658880	I don't think he would run for the boats.
2658880	2660840	I think the boats are the last thing he wants to be on.
2660840	2664480	Yeah, I mean, especially with what happened to my head.
2664480	2667280	I'm like, I don't want to even try to go back there.
2667320	2671800	He's going to yell for Angela and then maybe go into that back office that we saw James
2671800	2673040	in previously.
2673040	2676760	As you're hollering for Angela, can you do it for me real quick?
2676760	2677760	Angela!
2677760	2678760	Angie!
2678760	2679760	Angie!
2679760	2684200	That begins to echo out and just reverberate and repeat.
2684200	2689560	Walter and Alan Grimes, Charles Digby, Roger Fairfield, and Martin Cupertino, you are all
2689560	2691600	walking through the woods.
2691600	2693240	You're surrounded by trees.
2693240	2694320	You're running through the woods.
2694320	2695320	You're running through the woods.
2695320	2700920	Martin Cupertino, you have the map out, and you're leading the group through this jungle
2700920	2703320	trying to find the door.
2703320	2708240	Charles Digby, you feel blood rushing down your face.
2708240	2713080	I need you to roll a D6 and half it for damage.
2713080	2714080	Two.
2714080	2717440	All right, lose two hit points.
2717440	2718440	He rolled a four.
2718440	2721200	Made a two in his mind.
2721200	2722200	Quick math.
2722200	2724640	The fuck up, John.
2724640	2726240	Give away the secrets.
2726240	2733080	I'm not good at math, but I think we all assumed he rolled a four when he got to it.
2733080	2738760	Okay, so who is helping Martin Cupertino with the map, or are you guys allowing Martin Cupertino
2738760	2741200	to just lead you with his skills?
2741200	2745200	Before that, I assume I'm wearing an over shirt or something.
2745200	2750560	Can I tear it up to make a weird little bandage for my head, like a little hat for my head?
2750560	2751560	Yes, absolutely you can.
2751560	2753820	I want to cover up my sad head.
2753820	2760180	Can I use intelligence to read the map?
2760180	2761180	It'll be survival.
2761180	2764180	Does anybody have a good survival?
2764180	2765180	Nope.
2765180	2766180	I do.
2766180	2771860	I feel like there's other ways to read a map, but I think if maybe you were smart enough,
2771860	2773740	you could figure out what it was telling you.
2773740	2775900	You could do intelligence at a negative 40.
2775900	2777940	That's still better than survival.
2777940	2778940	What's your survival?
2778940	2780740	I'm actually pretty good at maps.
2780740	2781740	It's part of my job.
2781740	2782740	It's part of what I do.
2782980	2783980	I can read it for you.
2783980	2785260	I can navigate it.
2785260	2788660	But you also think your fake wife is real, so...
2788660	2790140	My wife-wife is my wife.
2790140	2791560	Can we trust you?
2791560	2792560	It's my wife.
2792560	2794100	I don't know where she is.
2794100	2795380	Hey, ease up on him.
2795380	2797020	He can still read the fucking map.
2797020	2799740	I need to ask Zach something without you guys hearing.
2799740	2800740	Tough shit.
2800740	2805740	What the fuck is wrong with Tom and us?
2805740	2806740	Hey, Joe.
2806740	2812420	So, Joe remembers that when I was in the office with James, he asked if I was single.
2813020	2815740	You gave me a not yes.
2815740	2818060	Does that come back to Roger at any point?
2818060	2822460	Yeah, let's say that it comes back to you right now as he's asking about your wife.
2822460	2823460	Okay.
2823460	2824460	All right, let's do it.
2824460	2825460	Everybody back.
2825460	2831140	So, Martin Cupertino is pressing Roger Fairfield about his wife.
2831140	2832140	Press me.
2832140	2833140	Press him, baby.
2833140	2837060	Hey, why don't we have your fake wife read this map?
2837060	2838060	My wife is real.
2838060	2841500	We've been together for...
2841500	2843740	We've been together for...
2843740	2845820	I met her.
2845820	2847260	I don't...
2847260	2848620	I was...
2848620	2854380	I was talking to James and he asked if I was single.
2854380	2855380	I said yes.
2855380	2856380	I said yes.
2856380	2857380	I said yes.
2857380	2858380	I don't...
2858380	2859380	Who's...
2859380	2860380	I don't...
2860380	2861380	I don't...
2861380	2863660	I don't have a wife.
2863660	2864660	I don't have a wife!
2864660	2865660	Hey, buddy.
2865660	2868580	I feel like all the answers are on the other side of this door.
2868580	2869580	Can you help us get there?
2869580	2870580	Yeah.
2870580	2871580	Yeah.
2871580	2872580	Yeah.
2872580	2873580	Yeah.
2873580	2874580	Yeah.
2874580	2875580	Yeah.
2875580	2876580	Yeah.
2876580	2877580	We gotta get out of here.
2877580	2878580	We gotta get out of here.
2878580	2879580	That's where...
2879580	2880580	Hey, maybe Angie's on the other side of the door.
2880580	2881580	I don't...
2881580	2882580	I don't know who she is.
2882580	2883580	I don't know who she is.
2883580	2884580	Okay.
2884580	2885580	Just calm down.
2885580	2886580	Just calm down.
2886580	2887580	The answers are on the other side of the door on this map.
2887580	2888580	Okay.
2888580	2889580	Now, here's the thing.
2889580	2890580	So, when you guys roll, who is reading the map?
2890580	2891580	Are both of you reading the map?
2891580	2892580	I think...
2892580	2893580	Yeah, I think both of us.
2893580	2899000	I need you both to roll into my little box that I'm holding.
2899000	2900820	It's Joe's dice rolling box.
2900820	2904380	And I need you guys to roll into it and not see the result.
2904380	2905380	Oh, shit.
2905380	2906380	Because...
2906380	2907380	Because you're gonna lie?
2907380	2908380	Like, what?
2908380	2909380	So...
2909380	2910380	Because...
2910380	2915180	Because I'd like the game to go a certain way, but...
2915180	2918980	Depending on whether or not you succeed or fail, I will tell you which way you think
2918980	2919980	you should go.
2919980	2924420	I don't want you to know whether you've read the map successfully or not, so I want you
2924420	2926020	both to roll into this.
2926020	2927020	Okay.
2927020	2928020	Cool excuse, but...
2928020	2929020	Joe, look at it.
2929020	2930020	Check it out.
2930020	2931020	Check it out.
2931020	2932020	He's busy counting.
2932020	2933020	Look.
2933020	2934020	Okay.
2934020	2938740	What do you have for intelligence minus 40?
2938740	2939740	30.
2939740	2940740	Okay.
2940740	2941740	And what do you have for survival?
2941740	2942740	40.
2942740	2943740	Okay.
2943740	2948740	So, as you guys are approaching, you're following the line on the map to the door.
2949500	2955660	And you notice directly across from you on the line where you are heading from off the
2955660	2962500	trail toward the door, you're about 20 yards away from where you think the door is, there's
2962500	2964220	a cave opening.
2964220	2969940	And then above that, there's a slight opening in the trees that leads above the cave.
2969940	2977860	I'd like to roll to double check.
2977980	2981140	We've got to be really careful about how we read this map.
2981140	2988660	Martin Cupertino, you are positive that you should go above the cave and about.
2988660	2995100	Roger Fairfield, you're pretty positive that this map is leading you into the cave and
2995100	2996940	then out through the door.
2996940	2999460	Fuck, and this is based on how we rolled?
2999460	3000460	Yep.
3000460	3001940	And we don't know how we rolled.
3001940	3002940	We don't know.
3002940	3003940	But we don't know.
3003940	3004940	Okay, so how do we feel about how we did it?
3005020	3008020	I will tell you, one of you succeeded and the other one critically failed.
3008020	3009020	We got that.
3009020	3011020	One of them critically failed.
3011020	3012020	Oh no.
3012020	3013020	Listen.
3013020	3014420	We need to go through those trees.
3014420	3019940	I mean, I read the map, I work with, I'm an archaeologist, I follow maps to places all
3019940	3020940	the time.
3020940	3021940	It's through the cave.
3021940	3024700	Everybody follows maps to things as much as an archaeologist does.
3024700	3025700	We all drive somewhere.
3025700	3027820	It's not like you're a fucking mapologist.
3027820	3033940	I have to decipher strange maps sometimes and this is a strange map and I feel confident
3033940	3034940	it's through the cave.
3034940	3037260	I think your result is pretty strange.
3037260	3040460	Why the fuck would we get out of the forest through a cave instead of going through the
3040460	3041460	clearing in the forest?
3041460	3043480	Why is it called a door on the map?
3043480	3044860	There's no door here.
3044860	3046540	It's all symbolic.
3046540	3049780	There's got to be another entry on the other side of the cave.
3049780	3050780	It's our way out.
3050780	3052880	Everyone, you go your own ways.
3052880	3054420	You figure it out for yourselves.
3054420	3056140	I'm going through the tree.
3056140	3057140	Who's following Martin Cupertino?
3057140	3060140	Don't go into the caves, you fucking idiot.
3060140	3062860	Don't go into the caves?
3062860	3064680	Come on.
3064680	3068340	We could split into two groups and check both of them.
3068340	3072100	That's what we're demanding happens here.
3072100	3074180	You need to figure out which group you're in.
3074180	3079540	If you want to die or go into the dark cave, I guess I don't know if it's death.
3079540	3082020	If you, if you want to get out of here, you go through the caves.
3082020	3086020	If you, if you just want to explore the forest more, go up there, I guess.
3086020	3089820	I'm going to go with Roger because I've been with him through so much already.
3089820	3090820	You fucking idiot.
3090820	3099340	I was like, I don't know what I rolled.
3099340	3102620	I know what I think is happening.
3102620	3110660	Walter, honestly, you're, I don't know what happened before this.
3110660	3111780	Look at me.
3111780	3115180	I don't know what we were before this.
3115180	3118060	Do you have the memory of us in the flower room?
3118060	3120940	I think that we should split up.
3120940	3123860	It's time for me to go on my own.
3123860	3130220	And you see Alan Grimes face just drops literally of sadness.
3130220	3131220	It doesn't fall off.
3131220	3135220	No, it doesn't fall on his face.
3135220	3136220	There's no fake faces.
3136220	3140460	In this one, there will be in the next one.
3140460	3145900	I know you don't like dark places and I start walking towards Roger.
3145900	3150380	Why are all the player characters going to die?
3150380	3152100	All right.
3152100	3157620	I walk off through the light in the woods.
3157620	3163660	Alan Grimes looks back at you, Walter, as you're walking away from him.
3163660	3168580	If you turn back, you see a single tear is falling from his eye.
3168580	3173980	I honestly, I don't know that you were my son.
3173980	3177060	But I thought of you as my son.
3177060	3180620	I'll see you at the end, dad.
3180620	3185020	I don't want that loser going with me.
3185020	3193220	Why don't you go into the caves and Alan Grimes just stands there and kind of shook, not wanting
3193220	3197220	to offend anyone, but clearly not wanted by either group.
3197220	3198220	Yeah.
3198220	3202060	Go into the caves, you feckless, perhaps sunless piece of shit.
3202060	3204060	Jesus Christ.
3204060	3208580	Well, I've got a cube to launch.
3208580	3212800	I can't deal with this shit any longer and I certainly can't deal with you.
3212800	3223340	I don't know, but based on my memories, I am not, I don't think I am a good person and
3223340	3226300	I don't know if I deserve to leave.
3226300	3227300	All right.
3227380	3231340	Well, why don't you go fight that worm monster single-handedly and let the rest of us get
3231340	3232340	the fuck out of there.
3232340	3237180	As you're saying that to each other, he is walking back down the trail away from you
3237180	3239740	all back toward like calm.
3239740	3242420	That affects Martin in no way.
3242420	3247660	Walter feels really, really sad for the first time ever.
3247660	3249200	It fills you.
3249200	3252780	These emotions are running wild within you.
3252780	3258180	I like get down, like drop to my knees and I actually start to cry.
3258180	3262300	And actual tears are pouring from your eyes.
3262300	3264300	Watch your electronics.
3264300	3266900	Walter, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's okay.
3266900	3270460	He wasn't, it sounds like he wasn't really your dad or something.
3270460	3274940	He, I don't, I just, I don't know what to think.
3274940	3278260	I, there's just so much going on.
3278260	3280460	I just can't compute it all.
3280460	3281460	It's...
3281460	3282460	Roger's going to try and comfort you.
3283140	3284740	I mean, there's this kid crying in front of him.
3284740	3289940	Charles Digby only knows how to comfort things in one way, which is patted on the head.
3289940	3290940	Like his pet cat.
3290940	3300380	He's like, it'll be okay, but he does like a pat on the head and he's like, Hey, Hey,
3300380	3302380	Hey, it'll be okay.
3302380	3303840	I've got a little bit of persuade.
3303840	3306380	Is there a role that I would do to like comfort somebody?
3306380	3308460	So psychotherapy would be comfort.
3308460	3309460	I don't have any of that.
3309460	3310460	You got 10%.
3310460	3311460	I got 10%.
3311460	3312460	Let's fucking do this.
3312460	3313460	Okay.
3313460	3314460	I quit.
3314460	3320460	Smack him on top of the head.
3320460	3321460	Bad.
3321460	3322460	I failed.
3322460	3323460	Also.
3323460	3324460	Yeah.
3324460	3325460	Yeah.
3325460	3327460	Slap yourself together.
3327460	3328460	Yeah.
3328460	3333380	He like hits me in the head and I just get down.
3333380	3335420	I pat you too hard where it's like not comfortable.
3335420	3340100	I'm just like completely prone facing the crook of my elbow crying.
3341460	3357500	Pooper Tino, fuck that guy fart and pooper Tino fucking got him.
3357500	3360440	We fucking got him guys.
3360440	3363820	What's going to work teamwork.
3363820	3365740	That's from the wonder pets.
3365740	3366740	That's cool.
3366740	3376620	I need to hear stuff in the room that I know I'm going to edit out later.
3376620	3378460	Who's leading the charge into this cave.
3378460	3379460	I assume it's Roger Fairfield.
3379460	3380460	It's gotta be Roger.
3380460	3382300	He's a he meant about this game.
3382300	3387540	So Walter, you've just been consoled very poorly by two grown men.
3387540	3396420	When I was a scalped man, when I hear them walking towards the cave, I kind of just like
3396420	3401700	look over and for a split second I try to decide if I'm going to the cave or running
3401700	3405840	after my dad, but I realized I've made that decision.
3405840	3409860	I get up and there's like dirt and mud all over my face and I start following them into
3409860	3410860	the cave.
3410860	3416480	The cave opening is large enough for two or three people to go in at a time.
3416480	3417480	It's not too small.
3417480	3421740	There are a lot of caves around here in Missouri that the entrance to the cave is literally
3421740	3424700	like you dive in head first and your feet go in the air.
3424700	3425700	It's not one of those.
3425980	3426980	It's like the smallest cave.
3426980	3427980	Exactly.
3427980	3432020	Like the largest cave opening in the world.
3432020	3437380	This one, you can, you can easily like kind of a crab crawl on your, on your hands and
3437380	3445380	the palms behind you kind of into it and scooch on your butt into a pretty large opening immediately
3445380	3450380	where you hear the drops of water and the distance.
3450380	3452120	And besides that, you hear nothing.
3452120	3454260	This cave system is moist.
3454820	3456480	Do we have mites and tights?
3456480	3458460	It is much colder here.
3458460	3461140	You got mites and tights for days.
3461140	3465500	Far more tights than mites at this first opening area.
3465500	3470060	So you're kind of dodging them with your mouth and making sure that no of the drip drops
3470060	3473780	get in your grill as you, as you scooch down in.
3473780	3476380	But then you can kind of stand up and you're standing on this.
3476380	3483900	It kind of looks like a tongue almost the way that it is like going in texture or shape.
3483900	3489660	It's both, I would say it's both, it's smooth and wet and there's a line down the middle
3489660	3494460	and you can kind of like put one foot on each side as you move forward.
3494460	3497780	And the light behind you is the only thing guiding you for now.
3497780	3500500	Do you guys have any lighters or anything on you?
3500500	3504740	I'd assume Charles Digby might be a smoker, but that's just an assumption.
3504740	3505740	Yeah.
3505740	3507340	Because he went to be incognito.
3507340	3508340	Exactly.
3508340	3510340	He smokes a lot.
3510340	3513400	I put my arm out like this.
3513400	3514400	Like what?
3514400	3517320	Forearm phasing up, palm up.
3517320	3528400	And I like touch in the crook of my elbow and my eyes light up a little bit and it projects
3528400	3529400	some light.
3529400	3535060	Uh, that doesn't happen, but you think it does as you put your finger there, then let
3535060	3537880	me do something else.
3537880	3538880	Do I notice?
3538880	3542640	You guys look over and is he like holding still and he's like doing it.
3542640	3547480	You guys look over and Walter is holding his thumb over the crook of his elbow and he's
3547480	3550760	like blinking really intensely and he's confused.
3550760	3551760	Hey bud.
3551760	3552760	What?
3552760	3553760	What?
3553760	3554760	Are you, what are you doing there?
3554760	3557560	This should be working, but what should be working?
3557560	3558640	Never mind.
3558640	3561760	I look at Roger and I was like, this kid's got some fucking screws loose.
3561760	3563000	There's something wrong that's certain.
3563000	3564680	We gotta take care of him.
3564680	3567200	You guys have like a flashlight or a lighter or anything?
3567200	3568920	I whip out a little Zippo.
3568920	3575840	Yeah and the Zippo is enough in this like pitch darkness to expose a large opening ahead
3575840	3582600	of you and there it, it gets smaller and smaller and the distance about 25 yards away.
3582600	3590240	And then there's another opening down there and you, uh, you see there seems to be a path
3590240	3592220	laid out from here to there.
3592220	3594560	Almost like people have been through here before.
3594560	3598480	I'll lead the way and I hold the lighter kind of in front while guiding them.
3598480	3599480	I'll follow.
3599480	3600480	Same.
3600480	3607600	And as you're going forward, you notice that you're now only lit by the slider.
3607600	3612560	When you turn back around, you see no natural light coming from behind you.
3612560	3616880	Guys, there's, didn't we just come from that direction?
3616880	3623200	I don't, I don't see, I don't see the, is there wind kicking in that's making the flame
3623200	3625160	go a certain way or is it still air?
3625160	3627520	It is still air.
3627560	3631040	Some of the stalactites must be in the, blocking the light.
3631040	3632400	Let's just forge on.
3632400	3635080	Yeah, let's press on I guess.
3635080	3636080	Yeah.
3636080	3640040	I think Roger right now is a little bit maybe wondering if he read the map right, but he's
3640040	3641040	still going.
3641040	3646080	So you guys go into this next little opening and there is a slide down.
3646080	3650320	It's a, there's a bunch of different rocks and stuff, but it's been smoothed out over
3650320	3651320	time.
3651320	3656760	There seems to be water trickling in this area just to your left and just to your right,
3657080	3663280	but there's a rock kind of stairway leading down a little bit and you notice that you're
3663280	3671600	now in a room that is probably 40 yards by 40 yards and at least 40 yards high as well.
3671600	3675400	And you're like up at the top currently looking down into it.
3675400	3678960	And earlier you said that there are signs that this is a used pathway.
3678960	3680360	People have been here, yeah, for sure.
3680360	3683800	I say, I'm, I think, I think we're going the right way guys.
3683800	3686080	There's, there's, there's signs that people have been through here.
3686080	3687080	Everyone has to be down here.
3687080	3688080	Let's, let's keep going.
3688080	3689080	Let's go.
3689080	3692560	Do you guys think Rollo will recognize me?
3692560	3693560	Without your hair.
3693560	3694560	Without the hair.
3694560	3695560	Oh yeah.
3695560	3696560	How's that?
3696560	3697560	How's that feeling?
3697560	3698560	Feels bad.
3698560	3700560	There's not a lot of skin up there.
3700560	3706400	So you guys make your way down into making our way down to making your way down into
3706400	3709640	this part of the cave in your home now forever.
3709640	3725920	So you guys get down this little like rock kind of stairwell and you realize your clothes
3725920	3727480	are getting muddier and muddier.
3727480	3732880	It's much cooler now than it was when you were out back in the woods.
3732880	3738720	Obviously you're in a fucking cave, roughly 52 degrees is what I'm thinking Fahrenheit.
3738720	3743560	I was just watching a formula, it doesn't matter, but I was watching drive to survive
3743560	3747640	the formula one Netflix show and they were like, yeah, it's fucking hot.
3747640	3749580	It's 32 degrees.
3749580	3754520	And I was like, ah, Americans, we're idiots.
3754520	3755520	Whoops.
3755520	3760720	Anyway, so you guys make it down and it is for our international listeners.
3760720	3761720	That's 11.1 degrees.
3761720	3768120	Yeah, it's like 11.1 degrees Celsius and thank you, Luke.
3768120	3775120	As we're wandering around and passing the time, I'm like, Hey bud, why do you, do you
3775120	3777280	think you're a robot?
3777280	3780340	Cause no, no, no.
3780340	3784280	We need to, if he's going to be with us, we got to know what's happening upstairs with
3784280	3785280	him.
3785280	3786280	He's right.
3786280	3787280	Were you trying to do something?
3787280	3788280	Were you pressing into your arm?
3788280	3789280	What were you doing?
3789280	3792880	I'm not supposed to say, I think you should say, I saw whenever we were in that meeting
3792880	3797600	room together, you like shut down when someone touched under your chin.
3797600	3798600	What was that?
3798600	3802800	I, my dad, he's your, he's your not dad.
3802800	3806520	My dad made me, are you talking about Alan made you?
3806520	3807520	Yeah.
3807520	3808520	I am.
3808520	3809800	We're pretty sure now that he isn't your dad.
3809800	3811120	Is that, isn't that right?
3811120	3817080	I mean, in a way he is, but I'm, I was never born.
3817080	3821100	When you said he made you, did you mean that in the way that you mean that he made you?
3821100	3822140	You think he made you?
3822140	3823360	I know that he did.
3823360	3824360	He built you.
3824360	3825360	He built me.
3825360	3828720	But I don't, I don't think that's, I don't think that's right.
3828720	3829720	I don't think he built you.
3829720	3832960	I don't think a robot could cry like you did back there.
3832960	3837920	Well, I came to this Island to see if I could pass as real.
3837920	3844200	So I guess one good thing out of this is that it worked, but you are, you are, you are real
3844200	3845200	Walter.
3845200	3847720	You're, you're not a maid thing.
3847720	3853800	You you're cyborgs aren't real, but then I'm not real, but you are real.
3853800	3856040	And I, uh, I want to pinch his arm.
3856040	3857200	You can feel that, right?
3857200	3860200	I was programmed to feel, oh boy.
3860200	3866680	When you got touched under the chin and you shut down, what did that feel like to you?
3866680	3869440	I just black out or sleep, I guess.
3869440	3876200	And sometimes I just can't move well from our perspective.
3876200	3882400	You just closed your eyes, but what did you think happened?
3882400	3883480	I shut down.
3883480	3887640	I, my dad made me and there's, there's more of me.
3887640	3889520	He was going to sell me.
3889520	3894880	And you get hit with a memory from before you were at calm, comfy campground.
3894880	3901880	You're in a cage and you're in a warehouse and it smells, it's fucking musty.
3901880	3906140	Like a junior high locker room that was abandoned over summer break.
3906140	3914660	This warehouse is filled with these cages, cramped, rusty, covered in a layer of condensation
3914660	3916060	due to the humidity.
3916060	3920240	And each cage has a kid in it, roughly your age.
3920240	3925740	And there must be hundreds of you all stacked three cages high, separated just enough to
3925740	3933860	limit physical contact and walking through the maze of cages and this vile warehouse
3933860	3942100	is Alan Grimes, followed by a few men who are hanging on his every word.
3942100	3944900	Some are orphans, some were collected from the streets.
3944900	3949540	Others had parents who were more than willing to trade them for drugs.
3949540	3952940	And that's where the learning center comes in.
3952940	3955940	These kids have no place in this world.
3955940	3958380	They do not exist.
3958380	3965460	And they could, therefore, be extremely useful to each of your organizations.
3965460	3966460	Uh.
3966460	3971740	You all right, Walter?
3971740	3977800	Is he like completely dazed out right now?
3977800	3983980	It feels like my mind is broken for a second and then I have to get back to Alan.
3983980	3988140	And I start like clawing at the wall, like jumping and clawing at the wall.
3988140	3995540	And the camera zooms out as we see Walter Grimes just clawing, mud, pulling up in his
3995540	4001100	nail beds as he's trying to get through this wall.
4001100	4007500	And we see Charles Digby and Roger Fairfield just take a step back and watch.
4007500	4011380	And you are now in this even larger room.
4011380	4013260	You can roll search if you want.
4013260	4014480	I do.
4014480	4015480	Search or survival?
4015480	4016480	Search.
4017480	4018480	I'm gonna do search.
4018480	4019480	Success.
4019480	4020480	Uh, success.
4020480	4021480	I success.
4021480	4028400	With all of you succeeding, you each look around and the stairs that you just took down
4028400	4032600	here that kind of like carved out stairs that made you think that this has been traveled
4032600	4037200	before are no longer there.
4037200	4043800	And it is just a smooth slide that goes at like an 11 degree angle straight up and then
4043800	4050440	surrounding you on the other side are equally tall walls about 40 yards high and you are
4050440	4057400	lit only by this very still flame that is casting each of your shadows onto these walls
4057400	4058400	surrounding you.
4058400	4061120	But is there no, no break in the walls anymore?
4061120	4062120	Roll Sanity.
4062120	4063120	Uh oh.
4063120	4065120	Uh oh.
4065120	4066120	Seven.
4066120	4067120	This seems fine.
4067120	4068120	Uh, 14.
4068120	4069120	I'm fine too.
4069120	4071120	Yeah, you guys just can't see it.
4071120	4072120	Oh shit.
4072120	4073120	Then yeah, you guys are fine.
4073440	4077360	You just can't, you just can't see it right now, but you just haven't found it yet.
4077360	4078360	It's no big deal.
4078360	4079360	Oh.
4079360	4080360	Uh, yeah.
4080360	4082960	Roger is going to start running his hand on the nearest wall and going in a perimeter.
4082960	4084360	Yeah, it won't take long.
4084360	4085360	We'll find, I'll find it eventually.
4085360	4086360	Yeah, exactly.
4086360	4087360	Yeah.
4087360	4089640	We're kind of like, Oh, I feel like since it's so, is it just like pitch black except
4089640	4090640	the lighter?
4090640	4091640	Exactly.
4091640	4092640	Have you guys read yellow wallpaper?
4092640	4093640	The short story?
4093640	4094640	A long time ago.
4094640	4095640	Yeah.
4095640	4096640	This is reminding me very much of this.
4097160	4103480	So I will just cut to a scene where the three of you are all like conga line style basically
4103480	4106880	with the lighter in front, holding your hands up to the wall.
4106880	4107880	Exactly.
4107880	4114540	And as we pan out, we see that the handprints that have been going around this room have
4114540	4124080	been going time and time and time and time in memoriam and you've made smooth hand prints
4124080	4130240	all across this wall repeatedly for who knows how long.
4130240	4133320	Holy fucking shit.
4133320	4135320	Fuck.
4135320	4148400	What's Martin Cupertino thinking as he leaves these three, four even, and heads above the
4148400	4151560	cave off through the opening in the trees?
4151560	4152560	Nothing in particular.
4152560	4156620	He's just completely, he doesn't have a single doubt about his own rightness.
4156620	4163040	And then all of a sudden, as you're walking, you just stop because you run into a wall.
4163040	4164440	Literally.
4164440	4165880	It's like there's a wall in reality.
4165880	4166880	Yeah.
4166880	4169320	I can see like forest through the other side, but I bulk it.
4169320	4170320	Yeah.
4170320	4175920	And then as you like reach out for it, you can tell that it is this like energy that
4175920	4177880	you can't quite move through.
4177880	4178880	Okay.
4178880	4182200	I would like to meditate and get in tune with this energy.
4182200	4183800	Full power.
4183800	4187600	23 on a 50.
4187600	4193460	After a short period of meditation, you open your eyes back up and you can very clearly
4193460	4199880	see where this wall goes up and looking up behind you, you see that it creates a dome
4199880	4203900	over the sky above you and you're on the very edge of it now.
4203900	4209040	And just to your right, there's a little opening where there is no energy.
4209040	4210720	I'd like to walk through that.
4210720	4217120	As you walk through the opening, this headache that you didn't even realize that you necessarily
4217120	4224440	had just dissipates and you feel free for the first time and you don't know how long.
4224440	4229320	And you do exactly what Thomas just did, which was exhale and like roll your eyes back in
4229320	4231320	the head.
4231320	4232320	Pleasure.
4232320	4233320	Okay.
4233320	4238320	Martin immediately takes out his 90s cell phone and he calls the secretary.
4239320	4243120	Bring bring bring bring Cupertino's office.
4243120	4245040	Why do you sound like Jack Russell?
4245040	4250040	Cupertino's office.
4250040	4251440	Cupertino's office.
4251440	4252840	You know who the fuck this is?
4252840	4253840	What fucking year is it?
4253840	4254840	Oh my God.
4254840	4255840	Martin.
4255840	4256840	What year is it?
4256840	4258840	It's 26 years ago.
4258840	4260200	Everyone knows that.
4260200	4265920	He takes a deep sigh of relief.
4265920	4267040	Perfect.
4267040	4270240	I'm still 26 years in the future.
4270240	4271840	Well, 26.3.
4271840	4273360	That's what I've calculated.
4273360	4274640	It's cube about to launch.
4274640	4277840	It hasn't been postponed yet, but is it ready?
4277840	4286240	Yes, it's it's going to launch cube and send me a fucking helicopter.
4286240	4288240	Hey, you won.
4288240	4296240	Yeah, I've never done that in a dream.
4296240	4301120	Roger Fairfield, Charles Digby, Alan Grimes and Walter Grimes, you're all sitting in a
4301120	4307320	half circle in the meeting room about to have orientation and a man walks in wearing a white
4307320	4312560	button down shirt, gray slacks and black dress shoes and he sits at the chair in front of
4312560	4314680	you and he says, hello there everyone.
4314680	4318800	My name is James and I am the executive director here.
4318800	4322480	Welcome to calm, comfy campground.
4322480	4326160	Oh, what the fuck?
4326160	4329640	Fuck you, Zach.
4329640	4332680	What the fuck?
4332680	4334480	I don't understand.
4334480	4338800	I feel like Clark could benefit a lot from this, but he doesn't know it.
4348800	4353920	What's up everybody?
4353920	4354960	It's Zach.
4354960	4359200	So the world is pretty wild right now.
4359200	4362520	Before I address how we're handling it here at pretending to be people, I just want to
4362520	4369800	say we wish you all the best during these unprecedented times for me personally, yesterday
4369800	4373960	COVID-19 hit a bit closer to home than I'd have liked.
4373960	4378960	My dad had just finished a 14 day quarantine after coming into contact with someone who
4378960	4385400	is Corona positive and the symptoms hit him like a truck on day 15.
4385400	4389940	This thing is real and it fucking sucks.
4389940	4396520	Please stay home, wash your hands and if you're young and staying safe, please offer to make
4396520	4401260	grocery and pharmacy runs for the older and immunocompromised in your lives.
4401260	4404440	We can make it through this mess together.
4404440	4409620	I know it's hard to stop touching your face, so maybe wear gloves that you've dipped into
4409620	4413000	spoiled milk and let dry in the sun.
4413000	4414260	Maybe that.
4414260	4419080	So we are currently waiting on the rest of our equipment to come in the mail so we can
4419080	4421620	begin recording remotely.
4421620	4426220	We've never done this before, so we might be taking a week off to figure out the logistics,
4426220	4431100	but my hope is to put out this Q and A episode Friday, April 3rd.
4431100	4435540	So post those questions on the thread in the subreddit ASAP and as for our patrons
4435540	4440060	over on Patreon, I will make an announcement once all our equipment is in and we have everything
4440060	4446020	set up and we know what we're actually doing, but we are so looking forward to making your
4446020	4449500	patronage really worth its belt size.
4449500	4454840	For those of you who don't know, I work as the director of human resources and community
4454840	4460880	outreach for a small business that owns five bars and I bartend a couple nights a week
4460880	4463680	as well for extra money.
4463680	4469800	The main thing I did was plan big events.
4469800	4474460	But even with all this shit, I'm not as worried as I probably should be.
4474460	4481640	These moments of crisis bring out a compassion and empathy in people that is so heartening.
4481640	4485040	So if you have the ability, please take this time.
4485040	4490280	Reach out to an elderly neighbor, Venmo a friend who's in the service industry, Zoom
4490280	4495720	with your family and friends and let them know how much you love them.
4495720	4503040	There are three more story arcs left in this campaign, and I am so absolutely fucking stoked
4503040	4504440	to see what happens.
4504440	4509040	I love you all, thank you so much for listening and supporting the show.
4520280	4545040	Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
