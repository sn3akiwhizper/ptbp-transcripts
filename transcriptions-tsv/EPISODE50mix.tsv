0	8160	Greetings, friends of all shapes and sizes, especially those that are octagonally inclined.
8160	13200	This is Wolf from the past, hitting you in the present, so that you can have a brighter
13200	14200	future.
14200	23440	And the future is always looking bright here on 694.2 PTBP, contentions only time travel
23440	25560	and pirate radio show.
25560	31800	Squares need not apply, because only the dopest geometry is invited to listen in on
31800	34240	this week's Howlin' with Wolf.
34240	40720	This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Matt in Singapore, aka at taffysaint, who tweeted
40720	44020	about the show and tagged that pretending pod.
44020	45020	They write,
45020	51000	Wolf, since the advent of digital radio and interwebs, we've been able to tap into your
51000	55440	dulcet-toned broadcast all the way out here in Singapore.
55440	61760	The trouble in contention sounds troubling, but I am sure what people remain are pleased
61760	65960	that you are there to recap the tragedy on a weekly basis.
65960	72160	I know when I am facing supernatural terrors from beyond time and space, it's useful to
72160	79080	have someone remind me what just happened, just in case there is a tentacle or proboscis
79080	81040	that escaped my notice.
81040	85960	Anyway, impending apocalypse aside, I hope all is well with you.
85960	91200	Your broadcasts have inspired me to seek a group of plucky idiots of my own out here
91200	97840	to help, ineptly, continue the fight for all that is right in the world, or at least some
97840	99720	unclaimed drug money.
99720	101520	Either or is fine.
101520	104880	Well, thanks for writin', Matt in Singapore.
104880	109560	All is well with your number one slime puppy, Wolf the dog.
109560	115080	I'm always gonna be here to remind y'all about all them tentacles that can creep up
115080	116080	on ya.
116080	117440	Y'all like hentai?
117440	119000	I certainly might.
119000	124760	But anyway, I'm glad to hear you are takin' up arms with a new crew out of the blue.
124760	127440	I got a couple tips for y'all.
127440	135120	Make sure you get eight hours of sleep, focus on work-life balance, and eat as much trash
135120	136960	meat as you can.
136960	142280	Remember, if you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to how, tag at PretendingPod

173400	178200	The sixth one comes out this week, and it's straight up some BTS action.
178200	186280	It may be the sixth Patreon exclusive episode, but it's our session zero for this whole campaign,
186280	191000	in which we discuss PC creation and fleshed out the town of contention.
191000	196080	Speaking of this campaign, what also has a shitload of gas in the tank and isn't slowin'
196080	198220	down anytime soon?
198220	201160	It's the news.
201160	208360	Last time, Jeremy Pettymore pacified a tied-up, bloody, muddy, naked man with teeny meat cylinders.
208360	213520	Ash took off back down the trail to tell Buzz, the ranger from the state, they had found
213520	215640	one of the missing persons.
215680	221760	Ken Krinklehoff met up with Jeremy after not running into Ash on the trail, and he takes
221760	224960	issue with Jeremy's new friend Rusty.
224960	233200	After being spooked by Woodrow, Judy Krinklehoff, Sharon Shadow Berryman, and Liz Lonklin answered
233200	235880	the ranger from state's questions.
235880	241480	Judy doused her arms in hand sanitizer and is deeply worried about her mother, Krista
241480	246240	Krinklehoff's minivan in the parking lot of the contention woods.
246240	253760	Liz tried to, down low, too slow, Woodrow's hand sanitizer squirt and failed, while Shadow
253760	259360	decided hand sanitizer would skewer her connection with the earth and the moon and such.
259360	265200	The three then saw dripping of blood from the back of Woodrow's neck, staining his shirt.
265200	271160	Ash Hornbeam got lost in the woods, saw Tree with a bright light shining from a forearm
271160	277320	sized hollow, and avoided a hidden tripwire before sticking his arm right on in that there
277320	279280	tree hollow.
279280	283260	This was a pretty alarming decision.
283260	286720	He seems to have risked his life with this one.
286720	291520	He'll have to take on any monsters in the woods single-handedly.
291520	292520	You hear that?
292520	300560	That's the sound of one hand clapping for Blue False Indigo with Moon Dance.
301160	305360	She runs.
305360	307360	She runs.
307360	309360	She runs.
309360	311360	She runs.
311360	313360	She runs.
313360	316360	The sun.
316360	318360	The sun.
318360	327360	The sun is sleeping soon.
327360	329360	She knows.
329560	344560	She knows that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance beneath the shadow of the
344560	354560	moon.
354560	357560	I'm just like, uh, dude, did you know that you're bleeding out of your head?
357760	359760	Oh, goodness gracious.
359760	364760	I lent my first aid kit to some nice young gentleman earlier and I wish they would have
364760	365760	left it with me.
365760	370760	So I actually have a first aid kit in my Lamborghini.
370760	377760	I call it my Lamborghini.
377760	380760	I could patch you up if you let me use your machete.
380760	383760	Oh, that is an interesting trade proposition.
383960	389960	I will give you a roll of persuasion with a plus 40 since you're trading such an enticing
389960	393960	offer.
393960	395960	25 on a 60.
395960	397960	Congratulations for passing.
397960	400960	I will absolutely take you up on that offer.
400960	404960	So he grabs the machete off the back wall and he hands it to you.
404960	408960	Now, I'm really hoping that you never use this.
408960	410960	I'll use it if I want to use it, but thank you.
411160	414160	If there's any brush in your way, it's likely to be mint there.
414160	415160	All right.
415160	416160	Yeah.
416160	417160	I'm going to file that away.
417160	418160	Okay.
418160	432160	So I go grab my first aid kit from my Lamborghini and I also grab one extra vial for his blood.
432160	433160	Interesting.
433160	434160	All right.
434160	436160	So as you patch him up, are you taking a sample of this blood?
436160	437160	He can't tell though.
437160	438160	It's on the back of his neck.
438160	439160	All right.
439360	440360	I'm going to do it for me.
440360	441360	10%.
441360	442360	All right.
442360	443360	A three.
443360	444360	Wow.
444360	445360	That's dope.
445360	446360	Means good.
446360	447360	Yeah.
447360	448360	Dope means good, Allie.
448360	449360	Unless it's drugs, which are also good.
449360	450360	Just kidding.
450360	451360	Don't you judge?
451360	452360	Yeah.
452360	453360	We're an anti-drug podcast.
453360	454360	Everybody knows that.
454360	455360	For all the 13 year olds and below.
455360	456360	Also the ones about drugs.
456360	457360	The ones about drugs.
457360	458360	I'm just kidding.
458360	459360	I'm just kidding.
459360	460360	I'm just kidding.
460360	461360	I'm just kidding.
461360	462360	I'm just kidding.
462360	463360	I'm just kidding.
463360	464360	I'm just kidding.
464360	465360	I'm just kidding.
465360	466360	I'm just kidding.
466360	467360	I'm just kidding.
467360	468360	I'm just kidding.
468560	469560	We're also the ones above 13.
469560	470560	Yeah.
470560	473560	I was going to say, I think our main listener group is like 45-ish.
473560	474560	Don't do drugs, dads.
474560	476560	If you're 14, you're in.
476560	478560	If you're 14, you're in.
478560	479560	Yeah.
479560	483560	Dads, wait till your kids are 14 until you start doing drugs again.
483560	486560	Taylor's coughing like so much.
486560	488560	It's like she's trying to sabotage us.
488560	492560	I'm just like trying to make this about me.
492560	494560	All righty.
494760	501760	So, with all of that taken care of, what are you bringing with you into the woods?
501760	503560	Did you bring any camping gear?
503560	507160	Were you planning on spending the night or are you just out here to do this and then
507160	508160	go back home?
508160	509160	We have some blankets.
509160	514360	I was told that this was a sleepover at Shadow's, so I just have my footie pajamas and my sleeping
514360	515360	bag.
515360	516360	I have no other thing.
516360	517360	And my toothbrush, obviously.
517360	518360	Obviously.
518360	521560	I have a lighter, obviously, and cigarettes, and a pocket knife.
521560	522560	Naturally.
522560	523560	Notch.
523960	534660	I have some crystals and a first aid kit, and I would definitely have other helpful
534660	535960	and useful items.
535960	540160	Well, you would certainly have the left pinky of a deceased squirrel.
540160	541160	Correct.
541160	542160	A...
542160	543160	A vial of my own blood.
543160	544160	Correct.
544160	547160	A vial of Woodrow's blood.
548160	555460	A bucket full of the soil from underneath a calf that was menstruating.
555460	556460	That's correct.
556460	557460	And...
557460	558460	Some bird poop.
558460	559460	Peat.
559460	560460	Yes.
560460	561460	Some strained out bird urine.
561460	562960	Did we use a sieve?
562960	563960	Yeah.
563960	564960	100%.
564960	565960	Yes.
565960	568360	Is Judy into gold digging?
568360	569360	Is that what a sieve is?
569360	570360	I don't know what a sieve is.
570360	575360	A sieve is not for gold digging.
575360	576360	Okay.
577360	581360	And I'll leave it at that.
581360	582360	Okay, so sifter...
582360	583960	Alright, let's get you guys into the woods.
583960	587660	You take everything that you brought with you into the woods, and you head down to a
587660	590360	designated camping spot.
590360	596460	The camp spots in the Woods of Contention traditionally have wood and a fire pit built
596460	601660	up and ready to go for each individual spot to make it easy for anyone who's spending
601660	604360	time there to immediately start a fire.
604360	610160	However, when you get to yours, you see that there are no rocks surrounding your fire
610160	611160	pit.
611160	612160	There's plenty of wood.
612160	614260	However, no rocks to speak of.
614260	619560	So if you were to start a fire, you think it might catch the woods on fire.
619560	620560	All of them.
620560	621760	Judy's very concerned about that.
621760	626060	I'm just going to start looking around for some bigger rocks to see if I can make some
626060	627060	kind of barrier.
627060	633260	Well, I just normally want to understand the soil below me because I don't really feel
633260	639060	like I can be a part of our ritual unless we're all in this together, meaning the earth
639060	642060	and the trees and the sky and the moon.
642060	652060	So I'm doing a little bit of swaying in the wind.
652060	653460	And Judy, what is Judy doing?
653460	655060	Just staring at where rocks were?
655060	660660	Yeah, Judy's just desperately looking for something to cling to as far as emotion.
660660	662960	She's really terrified already.
662960	665960	She's coming to grips with the fact that she's going to be out in the dark.
665960	667960	And Liz is already left to go look for rocks.
667960	668960	Yeah, Liz is gone.
668960	672360	So yeah, Judy's just standing around looking for comfort.
672360	675360	And I keep being like, Judy, sway with me.
675360	676360	Shadow?
676360	680360	Maybe we should just find a nice place to brush our teeth?
680360	683160	Maybe in a pond somewhere that is nice?
683160	685360	You're going to brush your teeth with pond water?
685360	686360	Oh, you're right.
686360	687360	Why would I do that?
687360	688360	That's so stupid.
688760	692760	Maybe we should go look for your mom, Judy.
692760	697160	Okay, Shadow, I really need you to stop saying that because you know how nervous that makes
697160	698960	me think that my mom is out here.
698960	702660	Someone definitely stole her car like Elizabeth said.
702660	705360	From like forever away, I'm like, Judy, your mom's fine.
705360	706360	Yeah, you're right.
706360	708360	Anything you say is right and always.
718360	731960	Lindsay, Liz is walking up out of your little camping spot and looking for these big rocks.
731960	737260	So first, I am going to request a sanity roll.
737260	738260	First one.
738260	739260	That means something's coming.
739260	740400	You've played D&D before.
740400	742360	You ain't rolled a sanity check.
742360	743360	Oh, fuck.
743360	744360	What'd you roll?
744360	747360	If I roll a double zero and eight, that's 100.
747360	748360	That's a pass.
748360	749360	All right, all right, all right.
749360	750360	So you rolled an eight.
750360	751360	I rolled an eight.
751360	752360	Yes.
752360	753960	Under your sanity, which your sanity is?
753960	755960	My sanity is 50.
755960	762660	Okay, so you're going to change your current sanity to 49 because you lose one sanity as
762660	767820	the world around you begins to kind of warp and change.
767820	772580	You were just looking through these woods for rocks and you could not find any and then
772580	776760	all of a sudden you are seemingly standing in a different spot in the woods.
776760	777760	All right.
777760	781760	Roll a surge for me.
781760	782760	21.
782760	783760	On?
783760	784760	On.
784760	785760	A 50.
785760	786760	Oh, congratulations.
786760	787760	All right, thank you.
787760	790480	So you're going to find a couple of things.
790480	797100	So you turn back and you don't recognize the path that you just took to walk out here,
797100	803240	but looking forward, you do see a few rocks, big rocks, and next to them, even bigger rocks.
803240	810640	And these bigger rocks have a cleavage that you can see right over.
810640	821820	And you see there's an extremely fit man in his mid 40s and he is bald and he has a super
821820	830280	cut jaw line, like a big jaw line with some one day scruff, single day scruff.
830320	836960	And he is walking around in circles with his hands just like waving all about and he seems
836960	839280	to be like talking to himself.
854280	856080	Judy Krinklehoff.
856080	857360	Hello.
857360	863800	You are standing near Shadow who is swaying and staring up at the moon and digging her
863800	870800	toes into the dirt beneath trying to become a moon baby.
870800	871800	A maybe.
871800	872800	A maybe.
872800	873800	Is what it's called.
873800	874800	If you won't.
874800	881160	And as that happens, I need you to roll a sanity check at a negative 40.
881160	882160	What is your sanity?
882160	883720	My sanity is at a 40.
883720	884720	Oh, right.
885080	887960	So if you roll a zero zero one, that would be a success.
887960	890640	But if your dice match, then it'll be a critical failure.
890640	893400	Sounds great.
893400	894400	I rolled a 98.
894400	899000	Oh my God, that's incredible.
899000	900120	So that's terrible.
900120	901120	And you failed miserably.
901120	902120	Cool.
902120	906680	I'm going to need you to roll a D six, which is the normal die in order to see how much
906680	908280	sanity you lose.
908280	909280	Okay.
909280	910640	I roll a five.
910640	911640	Okay.
911640	914760	You're going to go batshit crazy.
914760	921280	So when you lose five or more sanity in one go, you automatically will have a bout of
921280	924960	insanity is how we're going to play it for this little story.
924960	930040	That means that you will either have a faint, flight, or flight.
930040	931480	Did I say flight twice?
931480	932480	Who knows?
932480	936320	Flight, fight, or faint are the three options for your character.
936320	941160	So let's rank them in most to least likely for Judy.
941160	944960	So what would be the most likely thing for Judy to do in this situation?
944960	945960	Judy would faint.
945960	946960	Faint.
946960	949840	So if you roll a one, two, or three on the D six, then Judy will faint.
949840	953240	And what would be the second most likely flight that makes sense.
953240	956120	So if you roll four or five, she'll run away.
956120	959280	And then if you roll a six, she will get extremely aggressive.
959280	960280	Okay.
960280	961280	Sounds great.
961280	962520	Go ahead and roll that D six.
962520	964840	I got a five.
964840	970920	So Judy is going to freak out and take off running, but you look over and you see shadow
971320	978160	swaying and her swaying begins to become one with the trees behind her and the trees are
978160	985520	swaying and then the ground starts moving from underneath you and you lose touch with
985520	991920	your own sense of direction and the sky above you turns into the ground and everything is
991920	997440	upside down and the ground underneath you is above you in the sky and your feet are
997440	1005760	on top of your head playing patty cake with your hands and you cannot tell what is reality
1005760	1009320	and you need to get away from this place.
1009320	1011320	So won't Taylor come back in?
1027440	1033560	Hey Taylor, Hey.
1033560	1041920	So shadow is swaying in the wind and trying to become a maybe a maybe a moon baby.
1041920	1042920	Yeah.
1042920	1043920	Mm hmm.
1043920	1044920	Yeah.
1044920	1045920	That's a term I made up and I knew it already.
1045920	1046920	Yep.
1046920	1047920	Yep.
1047920	1048920	Everyone knew it.
1048920	1049920	Duh.
1049920	1052880	You look over and you see Judy and Judy doesn't look like Judy.
1052880	1053880	Like her normal.
1053880	1054880	Judy.
1054880	1055880	Hey Judy.
1055880	1056880	Hi.
1056880	1057880	How are you doing?
1057880	1058880	Don't talk to me.
1058880	1059880	You look like a tree.
1059880	1061360	How long have you been a tree?
1061360	1067240	I mean in spirit I've always seen myself more like a pebble but like a tree is strong and
1067240	1068240	powerful too.
1068240	1069240	So I'll take it.
1069240	1070240	Stop talking to me.
1070240	1071240	Oh my God.
1071240	1072240	I can't do this anymore.
1072240	1073240	I have to go right now.
1073240	1074240	Oh my God.
1074240	1075240	I have to run to safety.
1075240	1076240	Wait.
1076240	1077240	Where is safety?
1077240	1078240	I don't know.
1078240	1079240	Just don't talk to me.
1079240	1080240	You're a freaking tree.
1080240	1081240	And then Judy runs off into the woods.
1081240	1082720	I sigh heavily.
1082720	1085480	I say pardon me moon.
1085480	1086480	Just give me a minute.
1086480	1088280	I grab the machete and I run after her.
1088280	1092000	I should also add that Judy has put on her footie pajamas at this point.
1092000	1093280	Oh of course.
1093280	1095160	So she's wearing those as she's running off.
1095160	1097040	Does she have her toothbrush in her hand?
1097040	1098040	Oh it's in her pocket.
1098040	1099040	In her hand.
1099040	1100040	Oh and cute.
1100040	1103040	It's a zip up pocket so it'll stay in no matter what.
1112720	1120240	Shadow.
1120240	1124260	You were talking to Judy and she called you a tree.
1124260	1126120	If you were a tree what kind of tree would you be?
1126120	1130480	I would be a strong cherry oak elm.
1130480	1131480	Wow.
1131480	1133980	And suicide.
1133980	1134980	Tree form.
1134980	1135980	All mixed together.
1135980	1139160	For those of you who don't know.
1139160	1141160	What do you do when Judy just takes off running?
1141160	1144520	I'm used to Judy being a little bit erratic.
1144520	1148260	I'm also up for a little bit of adventure in the night.
1148260	1153120	I just sort of assume that like the forest will take us where it wants to take us.
1153120	1157960	And so I follow suit to find our destiny.
1157960	1163240	Oh okay so are you going to follow her in the same direction at the same clip or are
1163240	1164380	you just walking?
1164380	1165800	How are you doing about this?
1165800	1168800	I would say it's somewhere in between.
1168800	1170760	I'm definitely not walking.
1170760	1175160	I'm kind of I'm like leaping through the forest.
1175160	1176200	I love it.
1176200	1181360	And I have like these attached veils they attach to my thumb and they're almost like
1181360	1184440	these wings but just of like meshy material.
1184440	1185440	What?
1185440	1191120	So when I leap through it's almost like I'm a dancer but they kind of like float like
1191120	1207560	little ribbons out.
1207560	1208560	Lindsay.
1208560	1209560	Yes.
1209560	1214880	Liz is standing at a bit of a clearing here and she's looking at these big rocks and in
1214880	1221600	between a nice cleavage of rocks you have seen this man who is waving his arms about
1221600	1229680	and talking to himself and he is bald and has some scruff and a big jawline seems to
1229680	1236800	be in his mid-40s and I need you to roll an alertness check for me.
1236800	1241400	49 on a 50.
1241400	1243360	Congratulations.
1243360	1245640	So you're gonna see a couple things.
1245640	1251480	The first thing you are going to see is that the trees directly in the area that seemed
1251480	1259720	to be making a circle around this clearing all have a very specific sigil carved into
1259720	1260720	them.
1260720	1265760	It is like a single line with three lines coming off the top and two lines coming off
1265760	1271600	the bottom and it looks like kind of a like a branch of some sort and you would also notice
1271600	1278400	inside the clearing where this man is he is surrounded in a circle of a white substance.
1278400	1282840	Are we talking like coke or like liquid white?
1282840	1283840	Not liquid.
1283840	1284840	All right.
1284840	1295080	I know we were both thinking milk but it is a powder of some sort so that is what you
1295080	1296080	see.
1296080	1297520	What action would you like to take here?
1297520	1301200	I think as Liz, okay Liz.
1301200	1302200	You do think as Liz.
1302200	1306800	I think as Liz, yeah that's not how I'm thinking.
1306800	1310360	I think I'm gonna try and get the fuck out of there I don't think I'm gonna want to mess
1310360	1311360	with any of it.
1311360	1315320	Okay then let's roll a check against each other real quick you're gonna roll stealth
1315320	1321080	I'm gonna roll his alertness and we'll see if he sees you.
1321080	1324000	Okay all right I'm ready I'm rolling for stealth.
1324000	1325000	That is correct.
1325000	1328200	85 on a 50.
1328200	1330120	That is a fail.
1330120	1337360	That is a fail and so you are staring at him and then you take a step backward and just
1337360	1341720	crunch down on a big old stick, crack!
1341720	1346200	And it echoes throughout this little clearing that he's in and he immediately looks over
1346200	1352920	makes direct eye contact with you and he's waving you forward and he wants you to he
1352920	1356800	wants you to join him and he's like oh you gotta get around from over there you know
1356800	1363520	you gotta use a bit of my shiver in the woods you know it's not gonna find you if you didn't.
1363520	1369160	All right Liz finds this guy attractive so I mean he's talking to me now I'm gonna go
1369160	1376240	towards him okay okay probably mistake you are approaching the white powdery line and
1376240	1381920	he's like oh hey if we're gonna stop before you touch on it if you don't you step right
1381920	1386640	over it instead of messing but all right she steps over it and walks over to him and he
1386640	1391760	immediately like runs up to you and is and is like what are you doing out here if it's
1391760	1395040	not a problem in the night it's the sky's about to turn.
1395040	1397400	What the fuck are you doing out here also where are you from?
1397400	1401260	I you know across the sea came over for a bit of business but a lot of shit's happened
1401260	1406160	since then you gotta keep safe gotta keep safe there's nothing about the fish out here
1406160	1410640	so we gotta find it if it's not here then she can't find us and and if she can't find
1410640	1411640	us then it's safe so.
1411640	1413560	Who is she what are you talking about?
1413560	1414560	The lady in the wood.
1414560	1415560	Oh fuck.
1415560	1420920	Oh fuck is right oh fuck is damn right if you can't come around here yeah I've set up
1420920	1425560	a bit of a perimeter so if you stay here with me you're gonna be safe but if you leave it's
1425560	1426860	over.
1426860	1433100	And he walks back towards his campsite and you see on the back of his neck he has a tattoo
1433100	1439720	and it is like a stylized H so the two sides are kind of like curved in so it'd be like
1439720	1444960	a backwards C and then a normal C with a line going through the middle of them.
1445440	1451240	He doesn't have much with him he's set up like a little camp but he doesn't even have
1451240	1452720	like a bag with him.
1452720	1454960	Is his camp like within the circle of this white powder?
1454960	1460840	Yes and the circle of white powder is probably 50 feet diameter 25 feet radius.
1460840	1465880	Can I can I ask you do I trust this person?
1465880	1467520	Go ahead and roll humant.
1467520	1477200	I got a 41 on a oh shit.
1477200	1478680	That's a fail I bet.
1478680	1480800	Yeah I mean it's marked out so.
1480800	1481800	So how do you feel about it?
1481800	1483200	Wait wait wait wait on a 30.
1483200	1488160	On a 30 so that is a fail yes and how do you personally Lindsay outside of the game feel
1488160	1489160	about this character?
1489160	1495200	I'm feeling kind of sketchy I mean I just walked away from people that I've known and
1495200	1501040	there's a strange man he's attractive so there's like 10% 10% wanting I want to trust
1501040	1502040	him.
1502040	1503040	Sure.
1503040	1504040	Yeah but I don't.
1504040	1507680	Attractive people do have it easier in life just in general true it is a privilege especially
1507680	1513600	for people like Liz I wake up every day and I'm just like oh thank you so much lord and
1513600	1521040	savior same yeah so you you feel however you want to feel about him and he's like oh you
1521040	1526240	have to stay here it's nightfall at this point and if you leave you'd absolutely get
1526240	1531520	in thought so there's there's no way around here you know it's got to be with the fishes
1531520	1537600	and we've got to keep it left right upside down sideways I mean your feet might be where
1537600	1544200	my head is but we can't see it anywhere and there's accent changes all right so what if
1544200	1549200	I try can I just try and run back in the direction that I came yeah absolutely I'm gonna try
1549200	1550520	and do that what do I roll for?
1550520	1555560	You don't have to roll anything he's gonna call after you and he's just like oh no no
1555560	1561280	you got oh god damn you gotta fucking get got there's not a chance that you're not gonna
1561280	1572680	get got okay cool but I'm out of there right yeah you're out there now what roll a survival
1572680	1585480	check to see if you can make it back to your campsite 91 on a 40 hell yeah hell yeah dude
1585480	1591400	all right am I out now yeah you lost you're done uh bye dead yeah okay bye you're dead
1591400	1597440	you're not dead you're still alive you're just lost okay as Liz Lonklin is walking through
1597440	1605560	the woods desperately trying to find her campsite she loses track of where she is and the sun
1605560	1614940	is starting to go down you see through the trees this brightly colored vest almost cheetah
1614940	1621840	print but more of a cheetah print houndstooth mix what the hell and uh Luke if you want
1621840	1628120	to describe the predicament Ash is currently in Ash currently has his arm almost up to
1628120	1634640	his elbow in a tree and you can see around kind of shining out of the tree of very bright
1634640	1642160	light you can also as you get closer about an inch of my skin below my elbow is completely
1642160	1646920	ripped off down to the hand no like my whole hand is in the tree but about this much of
1646920	1655080	it is is ripped off okay like just muscle and fat fibrous blood you guys remember that scene in
1655080	1661600	127 hours when James Franco like cuts his nerve didn't watch it yeah that was hard to watch shits
1661600	1667400	fucking nuts dude one thing about that is if he was a true actor he would have actually cut his
1667400	1673120	arm oh you didn't hear about that yeah really he did so the whole thing off it's prosthetic now
1673320	1680360	just like everyone in Hollywood's teeth are fake right he has a fake arm cool so Liz that's what
1680360	1686960	you see as you approach you can also see Ash has tears streaming down his face from pain but you
1686960	1692880	he's not outwardly panicked but inside he definitely is Ash hornbeam I'm like startled
1692880	1699840	and I'm like oh hey Liz what are you doing out here me and the guys are well we're on a
1699960	1705520	camping trip but I kind of got lost I don't something really weird happened I don't know
1705520	1712640	where the hell I am and my arm is stuck in this tree yeah what's wrong with your arm what happened
1712640	1718440	to you I don't know if I can pull it out anymore because it feels like there are razor blades on my
1718440	1724600	arm in here and I was lost and I saw this tree and there's a hole in it with light coming out
1724600	1733000	and I I just stuck my arm in it and now it's stuck and it hurts really bad and I don't I drop
1733000	1738440	my axe back at the campsite so I don't really have anything to get out of here with do you have any
1738440	1742240	idea how you could help me I don't do I have any weapons or anything I don't have anything on me
1742240	1747720	I don't think you brought anything yeah I mean I would say go back to the campsite but I don't
1747720	1752240	know where that is yeah I'm also lost I don't know I just came from a place with some crazy
1752360	1757000	bald man surrounded in coke the reason that I got lost I was going back to the shack because there
1757000	1763000	was a crazy naked man that was all cut up and we tied him up and he also couldn't talk and he tried
1763000	1767280	to eat our food and he sounded like an animal what the fuck is going on out here I don't know
1767280	1773360	but my main priority right now is to get out of this fucking tree and I pull my arm about half an
1773360	1781840	inch out a little more lose another hit point and you feel your skin rip off the first three layers
1781960	1789080	of your skin are completely gone and blood begins running down your elbow and dripping onto the
1789080	1797400	ground and as you look down you see that the grass where it's dripping is dead can I like look around
1797400	1804160	and try oh by the way watch out for that trip wire there is there it is that's what I was about to
1804160	1812280	implement if you say that in time then I won't have her hit it so he calls out about a trip wire
1812280	1819000	and looking down right where you were about to step mm-hmm there is a wire that is running across
1819000	1828120	from a tree to a post in the ground I feel helpless that is part of the game yep can I go ahead and
1828120	1832000	roll a sanity check for me both of you because you do not know how to get out of the situation
1832400	1839280	and helpless is the exact word that I could use to describe this sanity check I got a 93 that is a
1839280	1847240	failure 34 on 44 so you're good so you're gonna keep a level head because your arms not trapped
1847240	1852640	in this tree yeah and you're starting to realize that yeah you might have to be the one to leave
1852640	1859840	and call for help Luke you are going to lose a single sanity putting your sanity down to 37 and
1859840	1867680	ash starts to freak out a little more and Liz can tell that I am very panicked I you freak out
1867680	1875080	enough to wear a little fun rule about this game is that when you lose sanity the handler can make
1875080	1880720	an action for you awesome so it'll be helpful and my arm will be out of here after that when you
1880720	1888280	lose that sanity you freak out enough to rip at your arm and try to pull it out without bracing
1888280	1897040	yourself and you pull your arm out another like three inches and you lose three hit points putting
1897040	1904840	your hit points at two Luke ash hornbeam needs to roll a constitution check in order to stay
1904840	1916240	conscious here 29 on a 45 oh you are allowed to keep your head however you are not allowed to keep
1916240	1922440	your cool I throw up yeah out of pain and panic calm down please stop pulling your arm out of the
1922440	1929800	tree hang on hang on just a second hang on just stay still and then I'm gonna be like help
1932360	1940600	anyone around you laugh maniacally after yeah I'm a bitch remember now that my arm is probably
1940600	1951720	there's more room around it right yet it is still just as as well as early pinched I really I don't
1951720	1956320	have any idea what to do right now okay I'm just gonna I'm just gonna like start looking for help
1956320	1960720	help help I start like running away I'm looking for somebody I'm gonna leave them cuz I can't do
1960720	1967000	anything yeah I like I've almost forgot that she's even here cuz I'm just looking at six inches of
1967000	1973840	my arm completely shed of skin oh what is that that's that's a nerve you can see it uh-huh it's
1973840	1979720	like just like in 127 hours it's like 127 hours yeah so I'm just standing here just staring at
1979720	1984800	it like in shock like look off I've started to say something to Liz but she's gone I'm out
1998000	2006160	Judy Krinkelhoff is running sprinting through the woods trees are lashing her body but she's paying
2006160	2013080	it no mind as the world around her is melting and contorting and convulsing all at the same time the
2013080	2019440	earth seems to be pulsating but the ground is the sky and you have no idea what's going on so I'm
2019440	2025640	gonna have you roll either which is higher your survival or your alertness my alertness is higher
2025640	2032040	and what is your alertness I have a 70 so you are going to be rolling at a negative 40 so you
2032040	2037880	need to roll a 30 or under in order to pass this alertness check go and roll those dice for me I
2037880	2048520	got an 11 that is a critical success and the world immediately all at once becomes normal to you as
2048520	2056600	you stop dead in your tracks because right in front of you is very clearly a pile of leaves
2056600	2063800	that is wholly suspicious as if beneath it lies some sort of trap but Judy notices this and stops
2063800	2074480	just before falling prey to this sham leaf pile however Judy is not alone in these woods Sharon
2074480	2083280	shadow Berryman as you are sashaying through the woods chasing after your dear friend Judy
2083280	2093560	crinklehoff I need you to roll an alertness check for me what's your alertness 40 okay I got a 61
2093560	2102640	all right so you do not see Judy teetering on the edge of destruction as you nonchalantly dance
2102800	2108520	burst onto the scene Ally I want you to roll dexterity and because you crit earlier there's
2108520	2113880	no chance you'll fall into the leaves so you're just rolling to grab shadow and throw her off her
2113880	2127960	path okay I got a 15 whoa so you I already had plans but so shadows like barreling toward you
2128000	2135880	in a very whimsical manner and you see her just in time to grab her and pull her to the edge and
2135880	2141400	the two of you fall and hit the ground and as you do that one of your arms flings out and hits this
2141400	2149400	pile of leaves and immediately the entire pile falls and you look down and you see that there
2149400	2169560	is a 10-foot drop into a pit below Judy oh my god you saved my life I just sort of thought that
2169560	2178360	maybe fate could take us together down that hole um shadow I am really trying to lose trust in you
2178360	2184040	right now because first you turn into a tree and then you chase me through the trees and try to
2184040	2191880	push me let's talk about that Judy like why am I no no I can't do this right now because I feel
2191880	2198680	like my mind is down that hole right now and I'm just up here without my mind right now do you want
2198680	2208160	to do some breathing exercises with my crystals okay let's go back to the camp and maybe on the
2208160	2213800	way we can pick some flowers and put them in your hair and you'll feel a little better would that
2213800	2224120	make you feel better Judy it would not who has a better survival check I have 50 I also have 50
2224120	2234240	okay then who wants to roll some dice I really wanted to find a way in this game to use my bird
2234240	2239240	calling sure so I thought maybe now would be a good time I could be like and then the birds
2239240	2249480	would lead us to the camp interesting and how might that work well I would go and they would
2249480	2255360	swoop down and like slowly flap their wings as we danced behind them shadow like knew which
2255360	2261920	birds were like closest to her campsite earlier so you could listen for those bird sounds as
2261920	2266840	opposed to earlier one well okay when I think of bird calling I think of like bird communicating
2266840	2272480	like it's a back-and-forth sure because I'm in that forest all the time 100 and so I have like
2272480	2279840	five bird friends so I would like to use my bird calling and my very accurate and reasonable
2279840	2289360	explanation is that I noticed that there were a line of oak trees right by our campsite and I
2289360	2298200	happen to know that there is a regional canary by the name of Churchill that's its bird species
2298200	2307600	of course yeah and it only nests in oak trees of that age and so I'm listening and right now it's
2307600	2317840	pretty faint but it's coming from the West so we're gonna head west three that's a good rule
2318680	2326400	listening for the sounds of the what was it church an airy yeah the bird which is in the
2326400	2336000	Oaks of a certain age you make your way back and you find your campsite however you do not find a
2336000	2346000	Liz waiting for you at said campsite but what you do notice is a raccoon a raccoon a raccoon that is
2346000	2352520	sitting on a log that is around the fire like a person might just like cross-legged and it is
2352520	2358320	using its tiny little fingers to eat food any food that you guys might have brought with you
2358320	2364920	it is chowing down on look at that little trash panda oh my god he's so cute I love him so much
2364920	2379440	Oh shadow what is that trash panda that you said um he our good friend really pretty friend Liz
2379440	2389920	what I mean I really love the idea that maybe Liz died and reincarnated very quickly into this
2389920	2397160	little raccoon maybe we should ask it some questions as you guys approach it you see this
2397160	2403800	raccoon it makes eye contact with you and it immediately perks up puts the food down looks
2403800	2409680	at you and then runs over to your bag and starts like throwing shit out of your bags and it's
2409680	2416840	clearly like looking for something I'm gonna watch it because I'm curious to see what it wants oh
2416840	2422400	wait is that the bag that has our potion in it yes whose bag is it who would have brought the most
2422400	2428840	food shadow I feel like shadow did yeah so then it's also the bag with the ingredients for the
2428840	2436400	ritual okay well I still want to kill Brittany just for my own curiosity yeah absolutely so I'm
2436400	2440640	gonna take off my jacket and I'm gonna walk over there and I'm gonna try to like jump on it and
2440640	2447200	like hold it down with my jacket oh hey what are you doing Judy Judy is pretty fucking anxious
2447200	2452680	right now so she has taken her arms put them inside the sleeves of her onesie that she's
2452680	2458280	wearing in the head crouched down and is just sitting there rocking back and forth saying Liz's
2458280	2472440	name over and over again and shadow I need you to roll an unarmed combat for me I fail and the
2472440	2479200	raccoon succeeds as you attempt to throw your jacket over on top of it it dodges nimbly out
2479200	2486600	of the way and it is holding a bottle of hand sanitizer that I believe Judy brought with her
2487080	2494000	you guys grabbed the hand sanitizer from yeah and the raccoon is holding it and it points at the
2494000	2502080	hand sanitizer and then it like does a thumb underneath its chin and swipes across like cut
2502080	2508240	throat and then it like throws the hand sanitizer on the ground and backs away from it and puts its
2508240	2514280	hands up and then falls over backwards like it's playing dead Judy didn't you use that hand
2514280	2524240	sanitizer maybe half the bottle on my body but I didn't eat it or anything so I probably am fine
2524240	2532600	or am I gonna die maybe we should use the water canteen and you should take off all your clothes
2532600	2539840	and we can pour the water all over you um shadow I really want to stay in my onesie right now I feel
2539840	2546960	really scared uh maybe we can just wash my hands really good when you say that the raccoon gives
2546960	2553920	you a thumbs up and then motions back down the trail toward the trailhead with its thumb go
2553920	2563640	ahead and roll sanity both of you is that a fail or success it's a success Oh congratulations I
2563640	2571600	got a 63 on the 35 so you Judy are gonna lose one sanity taking you down to 34 dang you have such low
2571600	2580320	sanity thank you for pointing that out I have 75 listen I'm insane so nothing messes with shadow
2580320	2588040	everything is already messed up in her head and like I'm mighty fine with that absolutely and so
2588040	2595040	Judy you were looking at this raccoon and you do not see a raccoon Taylor go ahead and take your
2595040	2601880	headphones off and plug your ears for me and just wiggle your fingers around in your ears don't get
2601880	2609920	in fact she's already not listening so Ally Judy sees this raccoon and looking in its eyes you see
2609920	2617760	a human soul okay I just see like looking at its motions and his activities you're like that's a
2618000	2624040	person I don't know why that I'm seeing it as a raccoon but that's a person okay all right Taylor
2624040	2630840	and the raccoon is like actively pointing down the trail and is staring at both of you and then
2630840	2640440	starts like using both thumbs in a like let's get out of here kind of motion please go with the
2640440	2647600	raccoon please I think we should really trust him he seems like a trustworthy animal but as an
2647640	2655480	animal and that I could trust Judy I know you've really been through a lot and I'm just not sure I
2655480	2662960	can trust your judgment right now but lucky for you I really like that little raccoon because he
2662960	2672040	reminds me of my mother or so let's go I like jump up I'm still like cradling my own body at
2672040	2676960	this point but I jump up and I'd start following the raccoon well I'm pretending to be the raccoon
2677000	2682800	as well so I'm kind of like I'm walking on my hearing legs but I kind of keep like little T
2682800	2688200	Rex arms yeah I'm kind of waddling a little yeah just exactly like the raccoon is doing that's
2688200	2712200	correct Liz lonklin you're walking through the forest through the trees trying to get back to
2712200	2721920	the trail and you come to a spot where you can hear some people talking and as you're walking up
2721920	2732000	you hear a couple voices and then you see hey what are you guys doing right now you're are you still
2732000	2744720	talking to rusty I'm freaking out yeah it's the it's the GM's job to paint a picture we're waiting
2744720	2753120	Liz lonklin you're walking through this massive trees and you are all alone as the Sun is going
2753120	2759400	down it is almost pure darkness and at that point it's a clear sky and the only thing you'll be able
2759480	2765760	to see by is moonlight and you know that and time is running out and you are freaking the fuck out
2765760	2772480	but as you make your way back to the trail you finally find it and as soon as you do you see a
2772480	2780800	campsite just off to the right in which you see Jeremy Pettymore and can clink it crinkle crinkle
2780800	2789160	ha and they are two freshmen from Silas Cole K through 12 Jeremy Pettymore you would know only
2789320	2798680	by name as the whole Pettymore clan is just a full big old family of rust abouts and and there do
2798680	2806120	wells and can clinkle ha fuck me you can call me whatever you want it's crinkle ha can crinkle
2806120	2815200	ha is a freshman as well at Silas Cole K through 12 and he is the star sport athlete at Silas Cole
2815240	2821200	K through 12 he is the future of this school the two of you would know that Liz lonklin is a total
2821200	2828360	badass always wearing her Doc Martens always disrespecting anyone who steps to her and as the
2828360	2833560	two of you are trying to calm each other down essentially well more so Jeremy is trying to
2833560	2842160	calm down Ken as you're talking to this man who is cut up and bloody and muddy and almost feral
2842160	2848360	but you're you're treating him with some with some nice little winkies and Liz you see this
2848360	2857080	as you approach their campsite winky wanky wanky terrible they're little Smokies thank you that's
2857080	2864480	different yeah oh is it yeah what way with little well this is like a feral man you guys don't like
2864480	2869000	it when I describe it in depth you don't like it when I describe it vague no I don't like you
2869000	2879960	describing little Smokies is like little ding dongs little Johnson's small meat fellas there
2879960	2889120	thank you I hear Liz approach and I should ash ash is that you ash no but ash is in trouble who
2889120	2897200	are you wait I would know them you just said that but you might definitely say who are you I'm Liz
2897240	2902280	Laughlin who the hell are you I see that it's not ash and I go oh fuck and I try to kind of block
2902280	2909680	her view from seeing the tied-up bloody man I think Liz would be one of the few like Jeremy
2909680	2913840	would probably definitely know her from school and the town and she's probably one of the few
2913840	2919600	people he like looks up to and respects absolutely he's a little wannabe Punk too well you are a punk
2919600	2926760	he wants to be a punk all right cool oh hey hey we got this wild man you want to feed him a smoky
2926760	2934800	why the hell do you have a guy tied up over here what the fuck are you guys doing out here he was
2934800	2941600	just out here kind of screaming and you know acting a fool so ash wrestled him into the ground and I
2941600	2948400	I tied him up but then he it just seems like a little some kind of dog man so I was gonna give
2948400	2953080	him Smokies and try to try to pacify him well why are you guys worried about this guy when like your
2953080	2957800	friend it ashes over there stuck in a tree you know that right no he took in a tree ash is stuck
2957800	2966400	in a tree his arms stuck in a tree I can't get him out oh his arm is stuck in how far away is

2978800	2994440	of tree is it we need to know what we're dealing with what kind of tree I don't know just like a
2994440	2999920	trade is like a normal tree I don't know evergreen or deciduous I don't fucking know it's just a tree
2999920	3005120	his arm is stuck in a tree was he trying to climb it he got wedged in a branch he didn't tell me his

3076640	3082640	Ken sometimes you have to do what's right and not what's gonna look good to a college admissions
3082640	3088640	board well all right I know associated with wild men ain't the kind of thing that you want to be
3088640	3094360	seen around cuz you're you're some kind of fucking you know achiever now and you're better than the
3094360	3099560	rest of us but once you was down in the muck covered in in scratches just like rusty here I
3099560	3104440	don't know what you guys are going through but I ran into some wild man out there in the woods
3104440	3109400	there's more wild man yeah surrounded by like a line of like some kind of white powder and he
3109400	3113720	was telling me that if I leave by myself something will get me so I don't want to leave this guy by

3436840	3447680	guys make your way back down you see the Sun is setting and it will be very dark very soon what
3447680	3453320	are your guys's hopes and intentions with this trip I hope to look death in the face that's
3453320	3458720	about it that's like my primary goal in life and Ali what about Judy Judy is just really worried
3458720	3465800	right now because she typically brushes her teeth at sunset and she has not been a she can feel like
3465800	3472160	the plaque but she does just like running over her toothpaste if you'll remember in her pocket
3472160	3476440	yeah she has never oh she does have her toothbrush toothpaste in her toothbrush but she's still
3476440	3480400	really nervous about the hand sanitizer on her hand so she doesn't want to touch are you gonna
3480480	3490080	use lake water to brush your teeth Judy she doesn't know she's very uncertain right now she also is
3490080	3495720	very concerned about Liz but more concerned about her teeth her teeth okay how concerned is she
3495720	3504960	about shadows well-being very little little to none I think about as much as shadow is worried
3504960	3513840	about her so as you guys make your way back down you see the back of the little shack that is where

3532960	3541160	would recognize it as your mom's voice is it coming out of her mom it is coming out of the
3541160	3553160	little shack at the trailhead okay shadow I don't want to freak you out but that is my mom yeah
3553160	3558280	that's what I was expecting I really hope that she brought her water bottle so that I could use
3558280	3565160	some of it to brush my teeth we should probably go up there and find her mom mom wait wait wait
3565160	3571160	wait wait Judy I listen to the racoon and I just look over at the racoon and the racoon throws its
3571160	3577760	hands up in a I don't know kind of situation can I pick up the racoon when you try to pick up the
3577760	3583360	racoon it like backs away from you stands its ground gives you a thumbs up okay I return the
3583360	3591520	thumbs up okay it reaches out for a high five I reject the racoon hangs its head and walks back
3591520	3596000	toward the parking lot Judy's starting to get pretty freaked out she really wants she really
3596000	3604400	wants that water bottle for my mom so mom mom mom hello hello is who is that who is there and you
3604400	3611040	see as you turn the corner that Krista Krinklehoff is poking her head out the little window of the
3611040	3617120	shack and is looking around and sees the two of you with a raccoon what are you what what are you
3617120	3626320	guys doing Krista have you used the hand sanitizer um yes as everyone should and then she like grabs
3626320	3633640	a thing of hand sanitizer from behind the bar if you will and puts it up on the little shelf the
3633640	3640600	little little ledge of the shack everyone should be washing their hands as opposed to you know
3640600	3647120	getting all higgledy-piggledy or anything else like you you must use hand sanitizer and not you
3647120	3653200	know bark at knots and you know it's the important thing to do her Krinklehoff household tradition
3653200	3657960	when Judy sees a bottle of hand sanitizer she runs to it and puts it in her hands she's already
3657960	3664920	forgotten that the raccoon told us not to use it and the raccoon will try to stop you from doing
3664920	3676240	this so let's roll a unarmed combat against each other here I got a five on a thirty the raccoon
3676240	3682320	got a four which if we play prices right rules so the highest number wins as long as you stay
3682320	3688920	under your staff so you fight this raccoon off to get some hand sanitizer and you put a bunch
3689000	3695880	in your hands yes that is absolutely right young miss you should definitely be using this I I don't
3695880	3701480	understand why what it is that uh brought made you bring a raccoon with you back out into the
3701480	3712360	parking lot of the woods it's okay it's fine you don't need to look at him or think about him at
3712360	3721560	all or you even be here even you could why why are you here I would like to humant Krista sure to
3721560	3729640	see if like she's a little brainwashed from the hand sanitizer okay roll a human for me I passed
3729640	3738840	34 and a 40 34 on a 40 would tell you that she is not in the same state that Judy was earlier when
3738840	3745760	she seemed to lose her shit okay daughter I am here because the man who was here earlier asked
3745760	3753800	me to watch his stead for the time being because he heard that there were some some folks out there
3753800	3759040	just wobbling jaws and and and he was afraid that they might you know get their barking irons out
3759040	3766120	and take care of business and we can't have anyone shooting guns and making mayhem out here in the
3766120	3771120	woods with all these missing people Judy is no longer listening to her mom she's digging in her
3771120	3774840	mom's purse to see if she has any water that she can use to brush her teeth she does have some
3774840	3781800	water and she will you can brush your teeth Judy brushes her teeth do you just do it like standing
3781800	3787000	out yeah she's like hanging her head out the door like ravenously brushing your teeth like it's been
3787000	3797160	years like it's been years so I taught her over to the raccoon mm-hmm and the raccoon like throws
3797160	3806240	its thumb again to the exit of the woods Judy I think that we should go back and get Liz Judy
3806240	3813480	looks up and she has toothpaste all over her mouth she says I really don't want to go back
3813480	3819360	into the woods right now I just want to stay with the raccoon probably you could go maybe
3819360	3825800	alone Judy I'm not sure that anyone could comfort Liz the way that you can you know about your
3825800	3834680	special connection Judy you left your friend Liz out in the woods all alone oh mom you don't need
3834680	3848240	to worry about that everything is fine Liz is probably just skinny dipping oh my goodness what
3848240	3855440	was your name again mom this is my very best friend shadow so sorry of course shadow shadow
3855440	3862440	you should go back into the woods and grab Liz I will wait here and Judy you can wait here with
3862440	3869600	me and then we will all leave together so Krista as much as I would love to do that because I feel
3869600	3876000	very comfortable and one with everything in nature I'm a little confused as to why you the
3876000	3882160	mother of my best friend would want me to go back into the woods by myself where several people have
3882160	3888200	gone missing okay well I will go back in with you if you would like and Judy you can stay here and
3888200	3893560	wait for us to come back that's a really good idea maybe probably the raccoon should stay with me
3893560	3898640	yes I completely agree okay that's great also could you leave your purse so I could have some
3898640	3905840	of those breath mints I really absolutely okay all right Krista let's have some real bonding time so
3905840	3912320	that maybe for once in your JD life you can remember my name oh you are a little firecracker
3912440	3920360	aren't you thank you Judy wait will you just watch it until the man comes back who's here he's the
3920360	3929440	what was he the the Woodrow fella the the whatever what was his thing he was the Ranger yes until the
3929440	3935080	Ranger comes back if you could stay here and the raccoon friend I suppose can can stay here as
3935080	3941280	well with the breath mints and then she leaves back up the trail with shadow I grab her hand
3941280	3947800	and kind of force her to skip with me into the forest she will reluctantly join you and said
3947800	3956880	skipping okay I might also sing a song oh what would that song be death is all around us just
3956880	3968520	look at its unrelenting eyes something like that something like that it's unrelenting eyes
3986880	3995840	Judy you've got your breath mints your teeth are brushed you've got your mom's water I need you to
3995840	4006840	roll a sanity check for me I got a 34 on a 34 oh that's a success congratulations you hold it
4006840	4013200	together even though your vision is starting to blur you're still going to lose one sanity okay
4013200	4020720	but that is just going to make the world around you slowly it's as if it's going to turn the way
4020720	4028320	it did earlier but it doesn't quite make it fully you just see your vision is rippling and the raccoon
4028320	4035920	is walking back from around the side of the building and it looks at you with these dead
4035920	4043760	eyes that are just like horrified and scared and it motions for you to follow it okay and I do it
4043760	4050680	leads you to the small restroom attached to this Rangers welcome shack and as you approach the
4050680	4058840	heavy metal door the Sun finally finishes its shift from the inside of this trailhead restroom
4058840	4068200	we see the scratched up brown door open and Judy Krinklehoff is backlit only by the single
4068200	4074760	flickering light illuminating the contention woods parking area I'm gonna need a sanity check here
4074760	4086160	yeah 26 on a 33 even with the success you lose one sanity as your mind tries to comprehend what
4086160	4091840	you are seeing she's starting to go a little numb so she's obviously she's freaked out her
4091840	4097080	hands are shaking a little bit and she's breathing a little heavy but she doesn't want to run she's
4097080	4103760	she just keeps staring at it she can't look away and we zoom up to Judy's shaking hands and her
4103760	4116240	dead stare from her eyes we see the body of Ed buzz Woodrow still in his state ranger uniform
4116240	4126360	but his limp body is on the dirty bathroom floor and it's been folded neatly like a freshly pressed
4126360	4156240	shirt. She runs. She runs. She runs. The sun is sleeping soon. She knows. She knows.
4156360	4172720	She knows that the time has come to dance beneath the dance beneath the shadow of the moon.
4186360	4213720	She moves. She moves. She moves with the howling wind. The sun. The sun. The sun has come again.
4213720	4235560	Her eyes have seen it all. The wonders of the wonders of the shadow of the moon.
