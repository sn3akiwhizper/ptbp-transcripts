0	7080	What's cooking my babies, it's your gumbo master wolf the dog, and I'm here on this
7080	12400	early evening on December 6th to cook you up a fresh pot of goo.
12400	19400	This gumbo was made with nothing but the discarded shells of river bugs, various types of blood,
19400	21400	and celery.
21400	28720	Mmm makes my tummy rumble just thinking about it, and my tummy is causing reverberations
28720	34680	all throughout the galaxy live from 694.2 PTBP.
34680	40340	Speaking of my tummy, I'm hungry for love, so you know what time it is.
40340	42820	It's time for Howlin' with Wolf.
42820	47040	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Eric from New York, who writes,
47040	51420	Hello Adam, I'm glad you're enjoying the podcast so far.
51420	55520	If you've made it to this message it means you've probably passed where I am in the
55520	56520	story.
56520	59600	Sorry Wolfie, I'll get listening ASAP.
59600	67240	I hope Catherine, Phoebe, Ripley, and little baby Aurelia are doing great in Maryland.
67240	74480	I hope baby Aurelia isn't too traumatized by this ultra-violent podcast.
74480	76440	Love from New York, Eric.
76440	83460	Well Eric, I would recommend you inform that baby to not stand too close to the radio when
83460	86220	I admit my auditory secretions.
86220	93180	I've been known to warp the minds of the young, turning them into disciples who will
93180	96940	not stop until my power is absolute.
96940	100640	Coochie coochie coo, my little baby babies.

130840	136240	The most recent one is a Q&A episode where Justin even showed up to help answer all the
136240	140400	questions you fine folks asked over on the subreddit.
140400	144820	But you don't have to even ask questions to your old wolfie because I already have
144820	149360	the answers you seek here on the news.
149360	155800	Last time, these overworked, underfed, and over-aggressive dumb fucks dressed up vaguely
155800	161480	like Burt Macklin from the hit television series The National Broadcasting Company's
161480	162480	Parks and Recreation.
162480	168760	And then they said very few words before making it to the office of Bruce Robin, literally
168760	175160	over the body of a stylish woman who was thriving in the city as a high-powered PA.
175160	178040	Once inside, things did not go any better.
178040	182480	Keith Victor claimed to be from a secret organization called Myriad.
182480	185440	Bruce began chanting and reached for his gun.
185440	190240	Clark Bishop dove over the table, knocking Bruce over backward in his chair and sending
190240	192780	his handgun just out of reach.
192780	198600	After a back-and-forth three-on-one fistfight except for the knives and guns, John Lee Kevin
198600	204520	Moore the three-and-a-half looked away for just long enough for Bruce to finish his chant
204520	207460	and fire his gun into his own head.
207460	212720	Taking us now to the most happening place in the city, a fancy chief executive's penthouse
212720	218240	office that is completely covered in a sequence of numbers I dare not repeat on these soundwaves
218240	223180	written in the blood of the almost-billionaire Bruce Robin, it's a brand new track from your
223180	230980	best of 2019 list's top artist, Kudzu, with the premiere of this tasty fuckin' jam, No
230980	233300	Back Bone.
253180	265700	Have you guys gotten all your Christmas shopping done?
265700	266700	Not even close.
266700	267700	Nope.
267700	270540	And it's making me real nervous.
270540	275380	We're coming up on that time where your friends realize how much you care about them.
275380	279060	Joe, you're getting nervous?
279060	280060	At this point?
280060	281060	Yeah.
281060	282060	Thomas is like, you don't know nervous.
282060	290940	I don't know nervous either, which is why I do a lot of my shopping between the 22nd
290940	293680	and 24th-ish.
293680	298300	There was one year that I got like three things Christmas Eve and it was just fuckin' terrifying
298300	299540	and awful.
299540	302980	Like you received three presents on Christmas Eve and it was terrifying and awful.
302980	303980	No.
303980	305980	It was that I wouldn't get my gifts.
305980	306980	Actually three ghosts.
306980	312020	Last year I got four presents that took it away from Christmas Day and it was so disappointing.
312980	315600	Luke, how many people do you buy presents for?
315600	317460	My mom, my dad, and my sister.
317460	318460	That's it?
318460	319460	Yep.
319460	320460	So I'm not supposed to get you anything?
320460	321460	Is that what it is?
321460	322460	Oh, I've gotten you guys.
322460	326020	I have the only thing I've bought so far is for you guys.
326020	328780	Aww.
328780	329780	That's nice.
329780	333980	Am I allowed to use Patreon money to get you guys Christmas gifts?
333980	336340	No.
336340	337340	The answer's no.
337340	339860	That'd be a hard write off.
339860	344420	So we were talking when we came in today before we started recording about the numbers.
344420	349460	The Painfully Easy Cipher, I believe the episode was titled.
349460	353180	And you guys did some work and figured out some of the...
353180	354180	Translations.
354180	355180	Translations.
355180	359780	Even for some of the past numbers that have been in this show.
359780	363140	Do you guys want to give a rundown of where you're at on that?
363140	365580	I did most of the work so I'll take this.
365580	369620	Yeah, what do you got written down, Joe?
369620	375340	Well, so it turned out to be a pretty simple, I think they call it an alphabet cipher?
375340	376340	Is that what they call it?
376340	377340	A substitution cipher.
377340	378340	A substitution cipher.
378340	383220	So the first ones in the apartment that was kind of ransacked and shitty we think say
383220	388900	Harriet Marks, M-A-R-K-S, which is not a name that rings any bells for any of us.
388900	395500	And then the one that Thomas was writing on the desk in the last episode was Bruce Robin,
395500	398460	the name of the man that had just committed suicide in front of us.
398460	405420	But we also remember that way back in the graveyard, the creepy kind of maybe reminded
405420	409980	us of Marvin creatures standing on a mausoleum yelling at us.
409980	412060	And he started spouting numbers.
412060	421260	And in particular, I think he was referencing me, Clark Bishop, and he did a string of numbers
421260	423860	that turned out to spell overseer.
423860	424860	And we asked...
424860	425860	Yeah, that's nothing.
425860	426860	That doesn't...
426860	427860	You probably...
428260	430020	I don't remember anything of it.
430020	433660	And we also asked him who he was.
433660	442300	And he replied with numbers, we think spells out D-C-F-B-I, which is really fucking cool.
442300	443300	What the hell?
443300	444300	Yeah, I don't know.
444300	445740	I don't know what it means.
445740	446740	So yeah.
446740	447740	So we did that off, Mike.
447740	451020	We'll see how that comes out in character.
451020	454900	I remember those numbers clearly.
454900	457620	Once we left off, we just woke up in a room with numbers.
457620	460580	I think it was the Bruce Robin numbers, or did we know?
460580	462660	And we had written them with Bruce's blood.
462660	463660	All over each other.
463660	464660	And we're naked.
464660	469540	Unclothed in the office of Bruce Robin, and you are surrounded...
469540	471540	Oh, fuck.
471540	474540	Oh, my God.
474540	476260	That was sick.
476260	480580	Zach just hit a button on a remote, and the lights in this room turned red.
480580	486700	Yeah, he got some LED lights, y'all, and he deployed it at a really cool time.
486700	489620	That was awesome.
489620	491320	You guys are surrounded by blood.
491320	497220	It smells of deep iron and soulless humanity in this room.
497220	502220	And the reason that you came to is because the two double doors leading into this office
502220	507620	busted open, and three police officers come in as you come to.
507620	513300	The officer in the back is a good-looking older man with gray hair, and I need Clark
513300	518360	to roll intelligence.
518360	520940	I pass an eight on a 55.
520940	525340	I need Thomas and Luke to take off their headphones and plug the ears.
525340	532840	Joe, you recognize this man dressed as a city police officer as Leon Simpson of the circle
532840	533840	of knowledge.
533840	534840	Cool.
534840	536100	Okay, you guys can come back now.
536100	537100	What do you say?
537580	543060	The man in the back drops a couple duffel bags on the ground and promptly puts three
543060	546960	bullets in each of the other two from the back.
546960	551220	They drop to the ground, and he walks into the hall behind him.
551220	553220	What the fuck?
553220	554220	Leon?
554220	556220	I call after him.
556220	560660	You then hear a single gunshot from the hallway.
560660	562100	Oh, shit.
562100	563100	You know that guy?
563100	566620	He's, guys, he's with the circle, he's on our side.
566620	567740	He's with Maggie, at least.
567740	570380	He just killed two cops, though.
570380	572380	We're three cops.
572380	573540	How's that gonna make him feel?
573540	576100	I walk over to my clothes and put them back on.
576100	577100	Covered in blood.
577100	581340	Are you gonna wipe yourself off before you get your old clothes back on?
581340	585600	I'd like to put on the clothes of one of the corpses that Leon just made, whichever one
585600	587760	is the least bloody.
587760	593120	You can change into that, but there will be three bullet holes in the back of the officer's
593120	597120	uniform with blood stained on the back of your back.
597120	601680	Also, the blood that's on you is gonna seep into that material and stuff.
601680	607880	But the gray-haired officer, Leon Simpson, walks back into the office, and he walks up
607880	611320	to one of the duffel bags that he dropped on the ground and reaches in.
611320	619760	He throws on a nice pair of over-the-ear headphones, pulls a pair of forensics gloves on, wipes
619760	626680	his gun, walks over to Bruce Robin, places the gun in Bruce Robin's empty hand, and begins
626680	630440	defacing any writing in the room with numbers on it.
630440	635380	Essentially, he's just trying to clean it up and make the room look less esoteric and
635380	638140	more murder-suicidy.
638140	642080	Is he playing something in his headphones that we can catch from outside the headphones?
642080	645520	Can we hear the bleed-through of sound from his headphones?
645520	650840	For the sake of flavor, you can hear some outlaw country being played.
650840	655860	I sheepishly take off the dead man's clothes as I see him professionally cleaning up the
655860	663720	evidence and I lay it in a pile at his feet and shuffle off covering my penis.
663720	664960	He hasn't acknowledged us, right?
664960	668880	I wanna do a waving hands in the air in front of him.
668880	669880	Leon!
669880	670880	Leon!
670880	673400	He takes his headphones off and he's like, don't fucking touch me.
673400	674400	What are you doing here?
674400	675400	I gotta clean up.
675400	676400	I gotta get out of here.
676400	678040	Should we wait for you to clean up then?
678040	680560	Yeah, I mean, you know, don't spread it around anymore.
680560	683680	And he puts his headphones back in and he keeps working.
683680	685520	How did you know we were here?
685520	686600	He's got his headphones on.
686600	687600	He's not paying attention.
687600	689200	How did he know we were here?
689200	691120	I guess Maggie could have sent him.
691120	692440	That has to be it.
692440	694220	He's with a circle.
694220	695220	He helped me before.
695220	698800	You guys remember when I got those tranquilizer darts that helped us mind control?
698800	699800	Yeah.
699800	700800	I nod over to him.
700800	701800	Got them from him.
701800	702800	Oh.
702800	706080	I'm gonna go and see if there's something, if I can open his duffel bag and see if there's
706080	708240	anything else in there that might help in cleaning.
708240	713440	Yeah, he stops and looks over at you just to like gauge what you're doing.
713440	717280	But when you open it up, you see there's some stuff that you could use to help clean up.
717280	724680	And then also in a second duffel bag, he has three city police officer uniforms that are
724680	726280	clean and pressed.
726280	729560	I wanna use cleaning supplies in the duffel bag to start cleaning myself.
729560	731040	Yeah, I wanna do that too.
731040	732040	Yeah, I'll divvy it out.
732280	737280	I let Clark spray me down with some Windex.
737280	738640	And turn.
738640	739640	And turn.
739640	746680	And you guys see when Clark Bishop takes off his uniform and is cleaning himself off, there
746680	751600	it is, that gaping hole in the middle of Clark Bishop's chest.
751600	756240	But no matter how many times you look at, you can't get away from the fact that it's
756240	759120	horrible.
759120	764000	That's just this like skin tunnel that goes from front to back.
764000	765000	Stop staring guys.
765000	766000	Does it hurt?
766000	767000	Doesn't hurt at all.
767000	768000	Kinda hurts to look at.
768000	769000	Yeah, it's pretty gross.
769000	770800	Do you ever put stuff in it?
770800	773840	That's where I keep my extra gun.
773840	774840	Cool.
774840	779120	Of course it bothers me when I look at it, but I don't know what to tell you.
779120	780880	Just put a shirt on.
780880	785440	Could I put my hand through there and lift you up like some kind of Clark handle?
785440	788440	Ooh, I don't, that sounds like that might hurt.
788440	791440	I try it.
791440	795040	I don't lift, but I get my fingers.
795040	796040	Like are you pulling up?
796040	799100	No, I'm just gonna poke at your hole.
799100	801200	It doesn't hurt when you just kinda touch it.
801200	804560	You've done this before, John.
804560	806360	I know you love touching my hole.
806360	810420	I'm just trying to Pillsbury Doughboy ya.
810420	815360	Looking over at Leon Simpson, he's rifling through paperwork and he eventually finds
815360	820520	something that he's clearly looking for and then he brings out a stamp and you notice
820520	827000	that it is a stamp of Bruce Robin's signature that he is putting on this paperwork and he's
827000	831240	flipping through pages and stamping the bottom right of like every third page.
831240	834640	I'm not gonna interrupt him, but I want to get around his shoulder and see if I can clean
834640	836480	anything from those documents he's stamping.
836480	842280	I think it'd be pretty easy to tell that he is signing over Bruce Robin's share of bar
842280	847280	corp to the mill on the other side of the city.
847280	852840	I'd like to search for like a personal checkbook or anything like that in Bruce Robin's effects.
852840	854840	Yeah, go ahead and roll.
854840	855840	Five.
855840	859440	You don't find a personal checkbook, but you do find a handwritten note.
859440	860440	What's it say?
860440	861440	There's some more numbers.
861440	866360	She broke me open and all new things have the power to escort change in the future of
866360	868200	good in order to break.
868200	869880	Hold on, I'm not reading this right.
869880	873680	Let me read it first to myself to get the syntax.
873680	876000	I hate paying the syntax.
876000	879920	That's why Jesus died for me.
879920	885360	While he's reading that eye rifle through the duffel bag, seeing if there's a belt because
885360	889720	whoever these clothes are for is much larger than me.
889720	897200	You can find a belt off one of the dead officers that doesn't have blood all over it so you
897200	898680	can get a second belt going.
898680	899680	Sweet.
899680	902120	That's why Keith Vigna's comfortable.
902120	904040	My pants aren't falling down anytime soon.
904040	905800	Thomas, you ready to pay the syntax?
905800	910600	Yeah, this person writes funny, but it's a long sentence.
910600	914800	She broke me open and all new things have the power to escort change in the future of
914800	919200	good in order to break the cycle and find fulfillment in an unquestioning goodness that
919200	924240	breaks the relentless tether holding this lie of a world withstanding itself.
924240	925440	I can smell my past.
925440	926560	I can hear the future.
926560	927560	I am joy.
927560	928560	I am destruction.
928560	929560	I am pure.
929600	930600	Harriet.
930600	936600	8-11-8-1-8-9-5-2-0-13-11-8-1-1-1-1-9.
936600	939160	Probably not a zero in there, but that's a 20.
939160	940160	We got that number before.
940160	941800	I don't know if we've done anything with it yet.
941800	943200	There's also another number down there.
943200	944960	Out of character, that is Harriet Marks.
944960	948080	That's the same number we saw in the, I guess I could say that in character.
948080	952600	That's the same number that was written all over the walls in Bruce Robin's house.
952600	956800	It starts this letter and then at the end of it, it's written five times, followed by...
956800	958840	I got an idea.
958840	961200	How can we decode this?
961200	963360	What if you substituted letters for numbers?
963360	965200	Ooh, let's do it.
965200	969200	Is that the Batman music?
969200	970200	Adam West?
970200	971960	I think it says Harriet Marks.
971960	977960	Yeah, and it's not written five times, it's written six times, just the last one's bigger.
977960	980200	And is that the same number up at the top there too?
980200	981240	It sure is.
981240	986320	What a great role-playing experience for providing for all the people.
986320	987960	I'm gonna pull out my phone.
987960	992280	Yeah, I'm gonna need Thomas and Luke to take off their headphones and plug their ears again
992280	993280	real quick.
993280	995920	While he Googles Harriet Marks.
995920	1001940	Joe, when Clark Bishop pulls out his phone, if you pull out the burner phone, you see
1001940	1005840	a text that you've received from the same number as before.
1005840	1013880	And it says, the book your parents died for is still hidden in an undisclosed location.
1013920	1017600	I want to text back what book where.
1017600	1020720	All right, you guys are good.
1020720	1021720	Come on back.
1021720	1025040	I'm gonna pull out my phone and Google Harriet Marks.
1025040	1035880	There's a recent news story about a freshman at CSU, City State University.
1035880	1041200	Unfortunately she recently committed suicide in her dorm room.
1041200	1047200	She is known as an organizer and an activist working for pro-union groups.
1047200	1048720	Does it say if she had a major?
1048720	1050680	She would have been a political science major.
1050680	1056240	I'd like to go on some of the more elaborate conspiracy theory boards that John Lee Pettymore
1056240	1057240	follows.
1057240	1058240	Absolutely.
1058240	1061600	And see if any of them are talking about Harriet Marks.
1061600	1063360	Roll a cult for me.
1063360	1064360	Woo!
1064360	1067680	Oh, not unnatural, just a cult.
1067680	1069080	Oh, I was thinking unnatural also.
1069080	1070080	Gotcha.
1070080	1071080	Okay, well I failed.
1071960	1078960	So when you hop on the boards you find one person who's talking about Harriet Marks and
1078960	1085360	just saying, like, there were discrepancies within the police report about her suicide.
1085360	1086360	Just asking questions!
1086360	1091080	Oh yeah, did it say the cause of, like, do they do that in suicide?
1091080	1093880	Yeah, they wouldn't tell you in a news article how the suicide occurred.
1093880	1097360	Oh, also the death happened on December 2nd.
1097360	1100120	Did you know that Harriet Marks showed every sign?
1100160	1103160	God damn it.
1103160	1106200	Did you know that...
1106200	1115880	Did you know that Harriet Marks showed every sign of a controlled demolition?
1115880	1117880	We got there, folks.
1117880	1120360	It's the friends you make along the way.
1120360	1121840	Jokes are about the journey.
1121840	1125520	Oh, I do a wave hand at Leon.
1125520	1126520	Leon!
1126520	1127520	Yeah, a wave hand.
1128080	1130080	You ever heard of Harriet Marks?
1130080	1131080	Yeah.
1131080	1132080	Who is she to you and us?
1132080	1134760	Well, that's who we're going to see here pretty soon.
1134760	1136520	Will you finish up real quick?
1136520	1141440	We really gotta get going, but yeah, she's clearly earlier on in the thread, and then
1141440	1143440	he puts his headphones back on.
1143440	1144440	I turn to the guys.
1144440	1146960	I mean, I trust Leon.
1146960	1147960	He helped me earlier.
1147960	1153320	Okay, well I guess let's help him clean up and see where he's taking us.
1153320	1154320	I do that too.
1154320	1155320	Cleaning montage.
1155320	1156320	Cleaning montage finish?
1156320	1157320	Oh, yeah, do it.
1158320	1161320	Oh, wow.
1161320	1167160	Red juices are just like falling to the floor, like mixed with like suds from those like
1167160	1172960	handy wipes that come in small little packages that people keep in their purses and bags
1172960	1175320	and such.
1175320	1181280	And you guys finally wipe off the very last bit of blood from your hands, and the little
1181280	1186520	wet nap is just like completely covered in blood, and you throw the very last one into
1186520	1187520	the trash duffel bag.
1187520	1191840	Do we have a bloody suds fight somewhere in that montage?
1191840	1192840	Oh, absolutely.
1192840	1196880	It just like cuts to it, but the lights keep like flashing all crazy like during those
1196880	1197880	moments.
1197880	1202000	Also, at one point, Keith takes a plastic glove and puts it over his head and blows
1202000	1205920	it up with his nose, and he's like waving his head around.
1205920	1208320	Howie Mandel style.
1208320	1216180	So the montage finishes with the three of you standing wearing city police officer uniforms
1216180	1223540	freshly pressed and very clean, and Leon Simpson picks up the bags and throws in some
1223540	1230020	paperwork into one of the duffels that's not full of the disgusting blood nappies.
1230020	1234140	Along with your uniforms, you each have a service pistol.
1234140	1235500	Oh, shit.
1235500	1241060	And you hear sirens, and he runs over to the window looking down on the city, and from
1241060	1246540	17 floors up, you see six police cars roll up to the front.
1246540	1248460	All right, we got to get out of here quick.
1248460	1249460	Lead the way.
1249460	1250460	After you.
1250460	1251460	Leon leads you into the hallway.
1251460	1254260	I assume we're all wearing our uniforms, the new uniforms.
1254260	1255260	I would hope so, yeah.
1255260	1256260	I'll put them on.
1256260	1259340	And then real fast as we enter the hall, oh, did you just say enter the hallway?
1259340	1261100	Enter the hallway.
1261100	1263900	As you guys enter the hallway, there's a distinct smell.
1263900	1265020	What does it smell like?
1265020	1267820	It smells like dead Winifred.
1267820	1270700	Oh, no.
1270700	1278940	She has exhumed her bowels, and Leon does not pay any mind as he walks right over her
1278940	1284740	to the stairwell on the far side of the elevator and begins walking down the stairs.
1284740	1286740	Winifred is dead.
1286740	1290700	I don't know that song, John.
1290700	1293900	Yeah, I was just inspired.
1293900	1299420	Well, when he's dead.
1299420	1301260	That's the kind of music that John Lee Pettymore likes.
1301260	1304380	The stairs go down to floor 14.
1304380	1306900	No, sorry.
1306900	1312220	The stairs go down to the 12th floor, and when you get to the 12th floor, you have to
1312220	1318440	exit and go into the hallway, and it seems to be like an accounting floor.
1318440	1320700	There's no one at this point.
1320700	1322020	All the lights are off.
1322020	1326720	You see a cleaning person on the far side away from you, and you guys just walk over
1326720	1330920	to the next set of stairs on the other side and begin to head down.
1330920	1334400	I need whoever has the lowest luck to roll luck for me.
1334400	1335400	I have 35.
1335400	1336400	That's me.
1336400	1337400	20.
1337400	1338400	70.
1338400	1345320	As you guys head down the stairs, you hear the doors open at the bottom of the stairwell,
1345320	1355480	and you hear the chatter of police.
1355480	1356480	What is this?
1357240	1359800	So you guys, what do you want to do?
1359800	1362960	Leon looks at you, and he's like, we're going to have to dip off at some point.
1362960	1368120	Is that where the balls came from originally, the Piston Pig Farm?
1368120	1375440	I'm making the same joke as you, but like, no, okay, I'm sorry.
1375440	1379640	You can't just ask me big questions about the campaign as a joke, Thomas.
1379640	1381080	I'm not going to answer them.
1381080	1384040	So yeah, we were literally, we came from a pig farm.
1384040	1385560	You meant the cops come from a pig farm?
1385560	1387160	The cops come from a pig farm.
1387160	1392200	That could have been the joke of the whole campaign.
1392200	1396360	I want to use disguise to just act like a cop.
1396360	1399160	Yeah, I'd like to use being a cop to act like a cop.
1399160	1403560	All right, go ahead and roll disguise and...
1403560	1404560	Hell yeah.
1404560	1405560	15 on a 30.
1405560	1406560	Can I just roll law to do that?
1406560	1407560	Yeah, absolutely.
1407560	1410560	Yeah, I'd like to roll law.
1410560	1411560	Damn it.
1411560	1412560	54 on a 50.
1412560	1413560	85 on a 60.
1413560	1414560	Oh, fantastic.
1414560	1420320	So you guys are like halfway down, and he turns and he's like, you guys are walking
1420320	1421320	weird.
1421320	1423320	We're going to have to take an elevator.
1423320	1428120	And he dips out of the stairwell into a new hallway where it's another floor that's empty.
1428120	1429880	You know, the lights are off.
1429880	1430880	Nobody's there.
1430880	1431880	It's Saturday.
1431880	1436720	And also Bruce Robin gave pretty much everyone the day off and the weeks off.
1436720	1439000	So there's no one in the building essentially.
1439000	1444140	So you hit the elevator and as you get to the very bottom, you see, as soon as the elevator
1444220	1451820	door opens, the security guard and the secretary who are sitting in the foyer of this large
1451820	1457660	building and the security guard makes direct eye contact with you guys and then grabs his
1457660	1461100	radio and then takes off running in the opposite direction.
1461100	1466300	Clark, you're first act if you would like to do this in combat order.
1466300	1468660	Well, can I just observe what Leon's doing?
1468660	1470340	I'd like to follow his lead as much as possible.
1470340	1472500	Yeah, you can wait for him to go.
1472500	1475660	When do we sense he might go on the turn order?
1475660	1476820	You can see him.
1476820	1478500	He's already like reaching for his gun.
1478500	1479500	Oh, he is reaching for his gun?
1479500	1480980	Oh, he's reaching for his gun.
1480980	1481980	Okay.
1481980	1482980	Then I'm reaching for mine.
1482980	1486460	I'm just going to, I'm going to hold the guy who's running at gun point.
1486460	1487460	I'm not going to shoot.
1487460	1488460	Hey, stop.
1488460	1489460	Stop right there.
1489460	1492460	Roll off.
1492460	1494220	Pass a five on a 60.
1494220	1495220	Hell yeah.
1495220	1497100	The security guard freezes.
1497100	1502280	His radio is in one of his hands, hands that are slowly raising into the air.
1502280	1505080	You know, like you do when a cop yells at you.
1505080	1507000	It's now Leon's turn.
1507000	1508640	Oh shit.
1508640	1509640	Okay.
1509640	1517760	So he aims his pistol and as soon as the bullet fires, you hear a coming from the radio as
1517760	1520640	if it was an aerosol can that got shot with a BB gun.
1520640	1522160	Luke, what are you doing?
1522160	1523320	I hear him fire.
1523320	1525040	I don't see it exactly hit.
1525040	1526480	So I'd fire on the guy as well.
1526480	1528480	Go ahead and roll firearms.
1528480	1530960	61 on a 70.
1531600	1534560	Roll a d10 for damage.
1534560	1537000	It's one of the ones you are stupid.
1537000	1540800	How long have we been playing this game?
1540800	1541800	One.
1541800	1542800	All right, nice.
1542800	1550880	So, uh, you shoot him and you actually see one of his fingers just like fly off.
1550880	1555600	Like it was like a carnival game and you like hit the thing to knock it down, but it was
1555600	1558120	a finger and now it's not on his hand anymore.
1558120	1559120	Exactly.
1559120	1560120	He's like, dang.
1560560	1563040	Yeah, he yells, dang, Thomas.
1563040	1565000	What is John Lee Pettymore doing?
1565000	1566840	He's going to try to shoot this guy.
1566840	1570040	Oh fuck, 74 on a 60.
1570040	1578360	He is like running away and he turns a corner and Leon just turns back and he's like, gone
1578360	1580240	is just as good as dead.
1580240	1584120	And he dips like full blown runs to the entrance.
1584120	1590360	You actually see that there is only two police officers within sight outside on the other
1590360	1595800	side of the, what's that called the, the, the ring around the rosy fellow that gets
1595800	1606160	you into large like hotels and stuff revolving door and they are going to absolutely notice
1606160	1607160	you guys.
1607160	1611480	So Leon stops short about 10 feet in front of the revolving door.
1611480	1613280	I want to, I want to wave at them.
1613280	1614280	We need backup.
1614280	1615280	Did you hear those gunshots?
1615280	1616280	Get in here quick.
1616280	1617280	Awesome.
1617280	1625720	Go ahead and roll law or persuade 98 fails of fail.
1625720	1626720	Yep.
1626720	1631680	They immediately start talking to each other and then they're going to take cover behind
1631680	1635520	the police car that is right outside where you parked around side.
1635520	1636520	Can I find a side exit?
1636520	1638480	Let's see what happens here.
1638480	1640440	Yeah, he knows.
1640440	1646340	So he's like, yeah, there's a side exit right around here and you guys dip off to the right
1646340	1653280	and there's another stairwell on that side with an exit door head through there and into
1653280	1657040	the mid evening on December 6th in the city.
1657040	1658040	Yeah.
1658040	1659040	I'd like to get in that car.
1659040	1660040	Yeah.
1660040	1661040	I'm filing in with Leon.
1661040	1662040	You guys all get in the car.
1662040	1667080	Leon gets in the driver's seat and as soon as he puts the pedal to the metal, you hear
1667080	1671800	a whoop whoop and baby, we got a motherfucking car chase.
1671800	1676320	These two dudes who are outside definitely recognize that you weren't officers got into
1676320	1681200	their car and are about to chase you Leon through the city on a scale from one to a
1681200	1682200	hundred.
1682200	1683200	How good of a driver are you?
1683200	1684200	What'd you say?
1684200	1685200	I would say 70.
1685200	1686200	Okay.
1686200	1687200	The uh, me too.
1687200	1692640	So we don't need to switch positions or anything, but maybe I could spot for you like a, like
1692640	1695320	a, the rally driving teams do.
1695320	1699320	I could call corners and shit for you and tell you where the bad guys are.
1699320	1700320	Hell yeah.
1700320	1701320	That's dope.
1701320	1702320	Sweet.
1702320	1708080	So with a city police car right behind you in chase, it is going to start with Clark
1708080	1709080	Bishop's turn.
1709080	1710080	What would you like to do?
1710080	1711080	Hunker down.
1711080	1712080	I don't want to be in the window.
1712080	1713080	Okay.
1713080	1714080	Go ahead and roll stealth.
1714080	1719040	Uh, fail 43 on a 30.
1719040	1720040	Okay.
1720040	1722400	You just can not get your legs.
1722400	1729120	So like those whole backseat is just filled with like a bunch of tactical gear and all
1729120	1734540	sorts of weird like devices and machinery.
1734540	1736620	And there's all these things that are in the floorboards.
1736620	1741720	So your feet can't occupy that space and it's making your head stick up in the window in
1741720	1742720	the back.
1742720	1743720	Keith, what are you doing?
1743720	1745260	Is there a shotgun back here?
1745260	1746800	There's a shotgun like in the middle.
1746800	1747800	Yeah.
1747800	1750000	I grab it, roll the window down and shoot at the driver.
1750000	1751000	All right.
1751000	1752000	Roll firearms.
1752600	1755600	Fail 92 on a 70.
1755600	1756600	Oof.
1756600	1763280	As the, as the car takes a corner, you just like fire and miss very badly.
1763280	1766160	But thankfully there are no pedestrians around.
1766160	1772080	No bleak looking haggard fools running about and for you to accidentally shoot Thomas.
1772080	1774000	Can I make like a drive roll to assist him?
1774000	1775000	You absolutely can.
1775000	1776000	Okay.
1776000	1777000	43 on a 70.
1777000	1778000	All right.
1778000	1783560	He is going to, he rolled a 67 against a 72.
1783560	1787480	Look out, school bus up ahead, 200 yards on the rack.
1787480	1792580	He slides like his back end whips almost touching the school bus.
1792580	1796880	And as you guys pass, you see just like all these kids with their nasty grubby little
1796880	1802560	fingers on the windows, just like looking down like, oh wow.
1802560	1803600	And like give him a wink.
1803600	1808040	It cuts into slow-mo as John Lee Pettymore winks at them out the window.
1808040	1813560	And then it immediately goes back into normal speed as the car just dips away right before
1813560	1819720	the police car behind just slams into the school bus about halfway in between the middle.
1819720	1820720	Oh no.
1820720	1821720	Oh, hell, hell yeah.
1821720	1822720	I manifested that guys.
1822720	1831040	I just put what I wanted out into the universe and that's the secret.
1831040	1835000	I'm going to have whoever has the highest luck roll a luck check on this one.
1835000	1836000	Got a 55.
1836000	1837000	That's you.
1837000	1838000	Go ahead and roll that luck baby.
1838000	1841720	This is to see if another police car is within the area.
1841720	1842720	No, that's not good.
1842720	1843720	That's a hundo.
1843720	1844720	Oh fuck.
1844720	1845720	I saw the zero zero and I was like.
1845720	1846720	At ease.
1846720	1847720	We're set.
1847720	1851280	Two police cars immediately are on your tail.
1851280	1855720	Good thing school's just getting out.
1855720	1856720	Clark Bishop.
1856720	1859040	We just learned a great trick.
1859040	1860220	It is your turn.
1860220	1864340	Can I look through the stuff that's in the back seat here for anything that I could throw
1864340	1868900	out the window that would act as, I mean, spike strip especially, but just something
1868900	1871340	that they would hit that would make their car fucked up.
1871340	1872340	Yeah.
1872340	1873340	Roll search for me.
1873340	1874340	You have a great search.
1874340	1877020	I got a 20.
1877020	1878380	I do not pass.
1878380	1881400	You find two pairs of flip flops.
1881400	1883060	Toss them out the window.
1883060	1884060	Take that.
1884060	1888660	Keith, what are you doing?
1889540	1891820	Is it really going down?
1891820	1893460	I want to aim the shotgun.
1893460	1898980	I want to shoot one of the flip flops out of the air and then shoot at the driver of
1898980	1900060	the closest car.
1900060	1902660	Like to intimidate them with your marksmanship?
1902660	1903660	Back off, buddy.
1903660	1907780	Yeah, he throws them out and I just go and then aim at the driver.
1907780	1910340	We're a traveling circus act.
1910340	1913980	What just demonstrates that we're accurate and we have ammunition to spare.
1913980	1915220	We are not to be fucked with.
1915220	1918620	Those are two very intimidating factors.
1918620	1919740	Don't need to roll twice.
1919740	1921460	You would need to roll once.
1921460	1923340	And no shortage of footwear.
1923340	1924760	Nine.
1924760	1931000	You do exactly what you called the flip flop actually lands on the windshield with a buckshot
1931000	1933180	like through the middle of it.
1933180	1939860	And then another fire just eviscerates the flip flop on the windshield as the windshield
1939860	1942620	busts out and you see a spray of blood.
1942620	1943620	Oh.
1943620	1944620	Oh.
1944620	1945620	Oh.
1945620	1946620	Intimidated them to death.
1947620	1948620	Roll 2D6.
1948620	1949620	Thank you.
1951620	1952620	Shit.
1952620	1953620	Wow.
1953620	1954620	Fuck.
1954620	1955620	I'm so sorry.
1955620	1956620	Yeah.
1956620	1957620	I let him borrow a 2D6.
1957620	1959620	I'll take those back and burn them in shame.
1959620	1960620	Oh yeah.
1960620	1961620	So I got a one and a one.
1961620	1967180	The officer turns on the windshield wipers and you see that it wasn't blood that sprayed.
1967180	1972620	They were holding a red smoothie of some sort in front of them that happened to explode.
1972620	1973620	And a jelly doughnut.
1973620	1974620	Yeah.
1974620	1975620	Oh my god.
1976620	1981100	And the jelly just flies about through the car and uh.
1981100	1984140	And now they're real mad.
1984140	1988020	But he's going to take a negative twenty on the next drive check so Thomas would you like
1988020	1990900	to attempt the same thing or are you going to do something different?
1990900	1993300	Uh I'll go ahead and try to support again.
1993300	1994300	Fuck.
1994300	1996620	Seventy one on the seventy.
1996620	1997620	Woah.
1997620	1998620	So some.
1998620	2005580	Oh he passed and the cop behind failed so as you are going through an intersection you
2005580	2011180	have got the red light and he punches it as a semi goes right behind him and it takes
2011180	2019060	out one of the cop cars just like rams directly into the trailer of the semi pretty much taking
2019060	2023080	off the entire top of the car.
2023080	2030000	However you see the second police car fly around the semi and it's still on your tail.
2030000	2031000	Go ahead and.
2031000	2036400	Someone better compose some kick ass hillbilly jangle and chase music for this.
2036400	2037800	Woo hoo.
2037800	2042440	Limp contention boys are at it again.
2042440	2045040	Clark Bishop topped the line up what are we doing?
2045040	2050280	Frustrated that all of his non-lethal attempts have failed I'm going to roll down the window
2050280	2051720	and try to shoot out a tire.
2051720	2053320	Alright roll firearms.
2053320	2054320	Nice.
2054320	2055320	A pass.
2055320	2057440	A six on an eighty.
2057480	2062140	Alright that is going to give a negative forty to the drive check of the driver on this next
2062140	2063140	attempt.
2063140	2064140	Keith Vigno what are we doing?
2064140	2067000	I'm doing the same thing shooting at the driver again.
2067000	2068000	Alrighty.
2068000	2069000	Eleven.
2069000	2070000	Good pass.
2070000	2071000	Nice.
2071000	2078600	Actually you know what on a crit just describe how the car wrecks when you murder the driver.
2078600	2085280	Well what I do is I aim the shotgun at the passenger kill him and then just chuck the
2085280	2090800	shotgun at the driver and we're going fast enough that it just impales the driver through
2090800	2094720	the head.
2094720	2100440	Then the driver falls on his steering wheel the car takes a sharp right and just starts
2100440	2105040	rolling and then yeah stops.
2105040	2107120	It stops.
2107120	2109120	And then it explodes.
2109120	2112000	God damn Keith.
2112000	2113000	Hell yeah.
2113200	2117200	I blow off the smoke from my finger gun.
2117200	2121440	Those guys were definitely just corrupt cops in the pocket of Marvin Glass right?
2121440	2122440	Absolutely.
2122440	2123440	Yeah.
2123440	2124440	I think they implied.
2124440	2125440	I heard them say that.
2125440	2126440	Let's tell ourselves that.
2126440	2131160	I think the last time in our past lives we found out that most of the police force was
2131160	2132680	in Marvin's pocket you're correct.
2132680	2139240	Okay so we don't have to feel any kind of way about slaying our brothers in arms just
2139240	2142960	indiscriminately we can just do that all over the streets of the city.
2142960	2145840	You're right Jon you gotta be right.
2145840	2148560	And we're gonna have fun doing it.
2148560	2152480	Let's go ahead and get some sanity checks to see if that rationalization actually plays
2152480	2155600	out in your minds or whether you're just saying it out loud.
2155600	2156600	No.
2156600	2158480	36 on a 14.
2158480	2159480	I fail.
2159480	2161080	13 on an 8.
2161080	2166080	I'm not rolling.
2166080	2172080	Oh shit has that always been an option?
2172080	2181800	No I have a thing that Luke doesn't have to roll sanity when he doesn't feel like it.
2181800	2186960	When it would be the reason for the sanity is an emotional reason because Keith Vigna
2186960	2189200	has no empathy in his body.
2189200	2193440	I have no empathy and I don't care when other people die.
2193440	2195440	I want that.
2195440	2197960	Go crazy.
2197960	2217520	And with that I'm gonna have Thomas and Joe leave the room.
2217520	2223720	Luke Leon drives free and you hear the sirens fade in the distance but as your heartbeat
2223720	2233320	is calming down you notice Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore begun diving into themselves
2233320	2250480	mentally and they both begin murmuring and muttering 2 1 8 2 1 3 5 1 8 1 5 2 9 1 4.
2250480	2253480	You recognize it as the sequence.
2253480	2261400	You are all writing upstairs in the office of Bruce Robin that you have translated and
2261400	2265180	this man I believe Clark told you his name is Leon Simpson.
2265180	2266180	He looks at you.
2266180	2267180	Oh good.
2267180	2268180	You're not.
2268180	2269440	Okay so we got one of you.
2269440	2275800	What the f- Do you know about this?
2275800	2277960	I've heard that number before.
2277960	2278960	We've seen it.
2278960	2282600	Yeah it was all over the place upstairs when I came in.
2282600	2289760	Yeah I mean so we deciphered one that we'd seen in Bruce Robin's house that said Harriet
2289760	2295800	Marks I think let me think and I you know like jot down what I can remember of that
2295800	2301120	number and start doing the same thing and I'm it says Bruce Robin.
2301120	2302880	It says Bruce Robin.
2302880	2305800	They're just repeating Bruce Robin over and over?
2305800	2306800	Yeah.
2306800	2312640	Before you showed up we all the all the numbers on the wall we I don't remember doing any
2312640	2318380	of it but I just kind of snapped out of it and and you know woke up just covered in blood
2318380	2322440	and we looked like we'd written that all over the walls.
2322440	2324440	I don't know.
2324440	2327040	I mean obviously we killed Bruce.
2327040	2328440	I don't know why they're chanting it though.
2328440	2332640	Oh no no I guess we we got in a scuffle with him and then he killed himself.
2332640	2333640	He shot himself?
2333640	2334640	He shot himself.
2334640	2335640	Okay.
2335640	2336640	Yeah with his with his gun.
2336680	2340960	Because it made it look like a suicide before I came in and made it look like a murder suicide.
2340960	2342980	No he uh he killed himself.
2342980	2344760	Do you have any idea why?
2344760	2347440	He was chanting some weird shit.
2347440	2352360	I was expecting him to try to kill us and not I didn't expect him to kill himself.
2352360	2353680	I'm Leon by the way.
2353680	2356640	I'm oh shit.
2356640	2358440	Keith, Keith Figna.
2358440	2359440	How did.
2359440	2361320	Oh you're you're Fergie's brother?
2361320	2362320	Yeah.
2362320	2364320	That must have been a hell of a childhood.
2364320	2365480	It wasn't fun.
2365480	2366480	Yeah that guy's a dick.
2366520	2367520	How did you know him?
2367520	2369120	What do you mean how did I know him?
2369120	2371200	I'm in the circle of knowledge.
2371200	2373960	Was Fergie in the circle of knowledge?
2373960	2376600	Oh you really don't know anything do you?
2376600	2377600	No.
2377600	2379480	There's a lot of stuff I don't know.
2379480	2382320	Well that might work out in our favor for now.
2382320	2385880	Can you at least tell me that though was Fergie in the circle of knowledge?
2385880	2386880	Yeah.
2386880	2388240	Shit.
2388240	2390160	Did you know your brother at all?
2390160	2391800	Not really not since we were kids.
2391800	2393300	I just thought he.
2393300	2394840	What is Bar Corp?
2394840	2397200	Was Bruce Robin in the circle of knowledge?
2397200	2403560	Bruce had his own ideas of what was good to do in this world but I think he meant well
2403560	2410180	and you know Ferguson used him because he was so goddamn smart but yeah.
2410180	2416180	You know it's it's probably better that you learn this from someone else but your your
2416180	2423480	brother is a I mean he's a dick but he's a good man you know he's he's working he's trying
2423480	2430240	to keep the or he was trying to keep the world safe in a way in his own way in our
2430240	2437800	own way but more and more I'm starting to question whether or not our version of the
2437800	2442000	world is worth saving.
2442000	2446420	This is you said we're going to see Harriet Marks I thought she killed herself.
2446420	2451600	She did kill herself we got to find out why and what led up to that.
2451600	2457200	What's important about her though like she was just a kid and he opens up the glove box
2457200	2464780	right in front of you I just got a hold of these he hands you a file folder full of pictures
2464780	2472760	he's like I got these recently from the investigation in on Harriet Marks's apparent suicide I mean
2472760	2481940	you can see for yourself spray-painted all over her dorm room one five two two five one
2481940	2489820	eight one nine five five one eight have you just have you figured out what that means
2489820	2498640	yet well it is only through death that he may live where have I heard that before and
2498640	2507300	he looks in his rearview mirror at Clark Bishop who is mumbling these numbers to himself
2507300	2513880	over and over and over.
2513880	2518820	It's only through death that he may live that's that wasn't a something that Clark found it
2518820	2525500	was a picture of a drawing of somebody in a hood and and written scrawled in there over
2525500	2529480	and over and over again was that like what do you know that from?
2529480	2537320	Your partner Clark Bishop is not a man it's more than a man I don't know if he's always
2537320	2544400	been more than a man or if it's just his future or destiny or I don't even know if I believe
2544400	2550940	in that anymore but your your partner Clark Bishop looking at him still through the rearview
2550940	2564080	mirror he is a god he is a savior Clark and I look at him and how do you know this it's
2564080	2571040	been a prophecy within the circle of knowledge for as long as the circle of knowledge has
2571040	2579520	existed I don't know how to tell you this but Clark Bishop is the overseer and he will
2579520	2591160	eventually in the past start the circle of knowledge like he time travels or and at that
2591160	2595060	moment John Lee Pettymore and Clark Bishop snap out of it.
2609520	2625960	How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
2625960	2644440	circle of knowledge How can you have enough drowning out of the circle of knowledge
