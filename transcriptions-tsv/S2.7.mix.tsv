0	4400	Welcome, brothers, sisters, and siblings.
4400	8200	It's your ethereal pup god, Wolf the Dog.
8200	11400	Blessings to you all, my children.
11400	19600	And I'm hollerin' from the heavens and the hells at you live from 694.2 PTBP.
19600	21800	A station of radio.
21800	25700	It's definitely somewhere at some time.
25800	31200	You know how most companies exclude their employees for participating in drawings,
31200	35200	so they can't be accused of manipulating the outcome?
35200	40900	Apparently that's not the case here at 694.2 PTBP,
40900	46000	cuz this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Joe Terry in Springfield, Missouri,
46000	49900	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,
49900	52400	which is self-promotion when he does it,
52400	55600	but it's super fuckin' cool when y'all do it.
55700	58000	Joe Terry writes,
58000	59200	Hey, dog.
59200	63200	You know how companies exclude their employees from drawings?
63200	65400	I don't think they're doin' that here,
65400	69900	so I want you to say Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip
69900	74600	is an underrated Aaron Sorkin show that I wish more people saw.
74600	79100	Bradley Whitford and Matthew Perry turn in electric performances
79100	84100	as co-showrunners of a Saturday Night Live-type program.
84100	86000	It got one season.
86000	87600	I want more.
87600	89000	Love ya, dog.
89000	92000	Hope the slop is sloppy.
92000	93900	You will, Joe.
93900	95600	Sweet Joe.
95600	97800	I love you too, buddy.
97800	102100	One day we shall frolic in the slop together as one,
102100	104900	but you shall feed me your life force
104900	110000	so that I may continue to live on and grow in power.
110000	114300	Do not worry, dear sweet delicious Joe.
114300	118800	Do not tremble when the darkness fills your vision,
118800	120600	surrounding you,
120600	125000	when you feel fangs scraping along the back of your neck,
125000	128500	when all of your senses start to fail you
128500	135400	and you feel yourself slowly but surely dissolving from this time.
135400	139900	We will become one, Joe.
139900	145700	And you start to think maybe we always were.
145700	148500	Welcome back, Joe.
148500	151300	The links are in the damn show notes.
151300	152400	The news.
152400	155600	Last time, the City Action News field team
155600	158700	took a single simple steel train car
158700	161500	across an awe-inspiring bridge
161500	165300	that ran over an unnaturally smooth chasm
165300	169700	filled with fog and an upside-down church.
169700	174400	A pre-recorded Fred Godel from the TVs in the train car
174400	178400	welcomed them to Godel's Gate to Grover's Gorge.
178400	181500	Through the next Spongebob-y hatch door
181500	187300	was a town ripped from futuristic concept art of the 1950s.
187300	192700	The first thing Julius wanted in Grover's Gorge was an interview.
192700	197300	And while they talked to a great employee of the Godel Company,
197300	200300	a GE of the TGC,
200300	205500	they noticed hopping along the synthetic track they all stood on,
205500	206900	a jackalope,
206900	209800	taking you back to this mythical critter.
209800	213500	It's a whimsical tomb and it's time to get litter.
213500	219900	It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My False.
219900	223900	And it's all my fault
223900	228900	Cause my life is great
228900	231900	And it's all mine
238400	243400	Cause my life is great
243400	246900	And it's all my fault
249900	255900	And it's all mine
255900	258100	Welcome back to Pretending to Be People.
258100	262000	You are now listening to what I think is probably episode 7.
262000	265400	Mr. Joe Terry, tell me what's a weird dream that you've had?
265400	265900	Ever?
265900	266900	Yeah.
266900	268700	What's like the weirdest dream that you've had?
268700	270200	I don't have a good answer to this.
270200	273300	Oh, I mean, there's one I've remembered for some reason since I was a kid.
273300	274100	Awesome.
274100	277900	I'm running down the hillside and it's like the Windows XP background,
277900	280800	like beautiful lush green hills and beautiful clouds,
280800	287500	and I'm leading an army of giant ants toward like a hole at the bottom of the ground.
287500	288300	Are you an ant?
288300	289000	I hope that's a prophet.
289000	290700	I'm like running fast.
290700	294100	I'm not an ant, no, but I'm like running fast and it's like joyous.
294100	296300	Like it's not scary or dangerous or anything.
296300	298300	We're like a stampede of giant ants running toward it.
298300	299700	It's like the most joyous dream I've ever heard of.
299700	302100	Yeah, that's so cool.
302100	305100	I don't know if that's weird though.
308900	311900	What do you guys remember from where we left off?
311900	312900	Where are we at?
312900	313800	What are we doing?
313800	315000	Are we in the normal world?
315000	317200	Are we just like hanging out at the news station?
317200	317700	No, man.
317700	318300	Are we in the city?
318300	322100	No, we're out on assignment and shit is not normal, Zach.
322100	323100	We're not in the city.
323100	325000	We're in Walmart country.
325000	326500	Where the shit is really real.
326500	331700	We're out in the boonies and we are in an impossible town that should not exist,
331700	334300	surrounded by impossible geography,
334300	339100	and we just saw a fucking Jackalope and news team is going to get some goddamn
339100	340000	answers for the people.
340000	340700	I can tell you that.
342500	342900	Awesome.
342900	344000	So, uh, Luke,
344000	348300	can you describe the landscape in which you are standing currently?
348300	350900	Yeah, Grover's Gorge.
350900	351300	Nice.
351300	351800	Got it.
351800	352400	Nailed it.
352400	355000	You can describe the city in one word.
355000	356500	I would say weird.
356500	358700	The landscape weird.
358700	359800	The people weird.
359800	364200	It's a huge space age city with bouncy colorful synthetic walkways.
364200	364700	Awesome.
364700	365500	Nice notes.
365500	366400	Very good notes.
366400	367400	Do you have luck right now?
367400	368500	Uh, I don't think so.
368500	368900	Actually.
368900	369700	You have luck now.
369700	370300	Oh, sweet.
370300	370800	Sick.
370800	371400	I like those.
371400	373100	I like those thorough notes.
373900	374700	There's two statues.
374700	375400	Joe's like,
375400	376500	what the fuck?
383000	384200	No, I was trying to find a clip.
384200	385200	Do you guys remember,
385200	385900	um,
385900	390000	Dave Coulier hosted a show that was kind of like America's home videos,
390000	391500	but it had a Jackalope.
391500	392300	Do you remember this?
392300	396200	You're thinking of Bob Saget hosting America's home videos.
396200	398900	Are you throwing us off because Thomas took good notes?
398900	399400	Oh shit.
399400	400200	No,
400200	401600	this is just his little tantrum.
403400	404000	I have no,
404000	405600	I have no recollection of this.
405600	406900	Coulier time.
406900	407700	Yeah.
407700	407900	Um,
407900	410500	I'm going to start taking notes once I use my point of luck.
410500	412300	Just when you thought it was safe to check the mailbox,
412300	413300	Jackalope 3,
413300	415600	tower came COD.
419600	421800	So Dave Coulier does the Jackalope's voice
421800	424100	and it's just a rabbit that they've tied horns to
424100	425200	and they do bits with it.
425200	426000	It's a real dead rabbit.
426000	429000	It's like a taxidermy rabbit that they've attached horns to.
429000	430000	That's awesome.
430000	430100	Well,
430100	434600	the one that you guys are looking at here in Grover's Gorge is alive
434600	438200	and it is just kind of hopping on this synthetic walkway
438200	440600	that people are jogging and walking on.
440600	440900	Zach,
440900	443400	where is it between us and the massive square park?
443400	444200	Ooh,
444200	444700	nice.
444700	448700	I would say that it is in between you in the massive square park.
448700	448900	Oh,
448900	451000	you can't have more than just luck,
451000	452600	but I'd give it to you again.
452600	452900	Ooh,
452900	454100	I'd give it to you again.
454100	454200	Oh,
454200	454400	no,
454400	454600	no,
454600	455200	I just want,
455200	456100	I just want your praise.
456100	460600	And what's across that massive square park where people are hanging out
460600	465300	in either green or yellow tinted or accented uniforms.
465300	466600	What's on the other side of that park?
466600	467600	I bet Joe knows.
467600	469000	Is it two big statues?
469000	471300	It is two big statues.
471300	471600	Yeah,
471600	474500	they're about twenty six point three meters tall.
474500	475100	In fact,
475100	477400	and they're made of green rock.
477400	479800	I've already said that.
479800	481200	What's on the other side of the statue,
481200	485100	labs?
485100	485400	Yeah,
485400	491300	it's a building that is made of glass and marble.
491300	495300	It rhymes ass.
495300	496500	Brass.
496500	497700	Brass.
497700	498600	Grass.
498600	502000	Grass and ass.
502000	505500	Ass glass of grass.
505500	508200	Off to your left side from your current view,
508200	509900	you see housing,
509900	510500	beautiful,
510500	510900	beautiful,
510900	512200	gorgeous housing.
512200	513300	And then off to the right,
513300	521800	you can just barely make out some buildings that are poking over some perfectly cylindrical trees.
521800	522100	Beck,
522100	524000	what do you think that to the left is?
524000	526000	What would you say those buildings look like?
526000	526300	I don't know,
526300	526600	Zach,
526600	527000	what are they?
527000	534200	And you see a whole line of beautiful homes that are like beautiful suburban homes.
534200	536100	They're all unique to each other though.
536100	544300	They all have their own special flair to them and they're enough apart to where you think it wouldn't be an issue to like hear your neighbors or anything.
544300	545600	There's definitely privacy.
545600	548900	Do I get a vibe of like the decade that these are?
548900	552100	Space age was the word you used to describe this place.
552100	555000	And so those are to the west.
555000	556100	Those are to the west.
556100	557800	If you came from the south,
557800	558200	to the west,
558200	560200	to the west.
560200	562900	Headin' west like you're blowing Kanye.
562900	563300	Oh,
563300	565000	nice.
565000	568500	Childish Gambino line for you there.
568500	569800	They both like oohed and aahed.
569800	571300	You should have just said it was yours.
571300	572300	I thought it was yours.
572300	574600	I'm Donald Glover.
574600	576900	Donald Glover.
576900	577100	Oh,
577100	578400	dong lover?
578400	578600	Oh,
578600	579000	dong lover?
579000	580300	Dong lover.
580300	580600	Okay,
580600	581300	these statues,
581300	584900	how are their dongs?
584900	586500	From this distance,
586500	598100	you would assume you're not sure how big they are proportionally based because you're just too far away to make out the subtleties of these statues.
598100	598700	However,
598700	605400	you can assume based on the enormity of the statues that the dongs might have a similar weight to them.
605400	605800	Interesting.
605800	608800	The dongs weigh as much as the statues or at least a similar amount.
608800	609900	They've got dense dongs.
609900	612400	The dongs take up.
612400	615900	I feel like my words are being misunderstood here.
615900	616200	What?
616200	616500	No,
616500	620500	not deliberately.
620500	623000	So two giant dong statues.
623000	624900	Remind me what the statues look like.
624900	626100	They're big penises.
626100	626500	Men.
626500	627800	They are two men.
627800	628800	Are they doing anything?
628800	635900	One is standing with hands in his pockets and the other one is standing with hands kind of on his hips.
635900	639100	We're kind of familiar with what the more famous Godels look like.
639100	639900	Yeah.
639900	640700	Are these the Godels?
640700	641900	These are these the Godels.
641900	647300	The one with the hands on the hips is Frank Godel Grand Granddaddy Godel.
647300	657200	And the one playing pocket pool with his statue hog is Fred Godel who you saw in the video in the train on the way into Grover's Gorge.
657200	658400	Which is his son.
658400	659300	Which is his son.
659300	659700	Yes,
659700	668500	and you would just know from general worldly knowledge that Fred Godel does have both a daughter and a son.
668500	674800	Fox and the Hound.
674800	675100	Yeah,
675100	679500	Fox and Faith Fox and Faith Godel.
679500	679800	F.
679800	680100	Yeah,
680100	682400	dude.
682400	683900	Some people do that.
683900	686000	Frank Godel.
686000	690000	This Frank Godel that did all the mythological fighting.
690000	690800	That is correct.
690800	691000	Yes,
691000	693200	according to the story told on the train.
693200	696900	Some people name their kids mostly like their sons like the same name.
696900	699000	It's fucking weird as hell,
699000	699500	dude.
699500	700600	Must be confusing.
700600	703600	I would never name an NPC with the same name as another NPC.
703600	703800	No,
703800	708500	you wouldn't ever do that.
708500	711400	So you guys are all standing on this.
711400	714000	It's kind of a bouncy pathway.
714000	716700	You're talking to Jennifer who is from here.
716700	717400	She's a GE.
717400	718600	She's a great employee.
718600	721800	She said for the Godel company here in Grover's Gorge.
721800	726800	She was born and raised here and has worked for the Godel company for a few years now.
727100	729500	She's in her like early to mid 20s.
729500	731900	And now the corner of your eyes,
731900	741000	you all noticed a Jackalope kind of hopping across this bouncy walkway that others are exercising and jogging on.
741000	743100	Some people are paying it a little bit of attention,
743100	743500	you know,
743500	749900	pointing at it going woo woo.
749900	753000	Classic reaction to an animal.
753000	757700	And you see that it has a yellow ribbon tied around its head around its antlers.
757700	758200	Cal says,
758200	765000	what the hell is even that?
765000	768700	Woo woo yeah go GE's hungry for points.
768700	772200	And she kind of like motions with her hand to a couple others
772200	778100	and they all kind of run around and make a circle around this Jackalope that's sitting on the ground
778100	780600	and they hold each other's hands and they go,
780600	783800	I'm a GE of TGC.
783800	786500	I'm a GE of TCG.
786500	790000	Hey, I'm a GE of TGC.
790000	793100	I'm a GE of TGC.
793100	796700	And then she kind of like laughs and Saunders back to you guys.
796700	798400	Well, so as as they're like doing that,
798400	803600	I'm Cal is like motioning back and Julius forward to like run up to the circle and get a shot.
803600	804500	Definitely doing that.
804500	804800	Yeah.
804800	810200	Yeah as they part do we see a real Jackalope or is there visibly like glue on its fucking head
810200	817400	or no, but you would notice that I yeah looks like these antlers are tied on with a yellow ribbon.
817400	824400	Seemingly the question I had was like when they're chanting the that stuff are you on purpose saying?
824400	825000	No, sorry.
825000	826000	That was my question also,
826000	828400	so we should always hear it as TGC.
828400	828700	Yeah.
828700	832200	Okay, my bad because you consistently were doing it the second time you were saying it.
832200	833700	So I thought you were saying oh my god.
833700	836800	That's because I typed it wrong.
836800	840100	No, it's because I'm an idiot.
840100	852100	Same thing I was like I was like we need to ask about what what is GTC.
852100	855100	I knew you were just fucking up.
855100	856800	Thank you Thomas.
856800	863800	Thanks for not reading into that look double luck.
863800	866700	I just can't take that back baby when I think of you.
866700	871100	I think of you like your freaking mastermind that has every single detail planned out.
871100	873300	So I'm like you're hiding something from us you fucker.
873300	877000	He's got you so fooled.
877000	883700	Julius is definitely recording on his phone like trying to get up as close to the Jackalope as possible.
883700	885300	Is it does it seem scared?
885300	887700	No, it does not seem scared.
887700	890700	It is very very calm Beck wouldn't want to break the circle,
890700	894300	but he would want to put his camera between the heads of two people to film directly down.
894300	896100	Do they react to me doing that at all?
896100	897100	No, not at all.
897100	897900	That's a great shot.
897900	900700	What are you guys?
900700	903000	What are you guys doing?
903000	905500	I've asked the people around the Jackalope.
905500	907400	Oh, hey, what's up?
907400	907900	Oh, hi.
907900	909000	Hey, how's it going?
909000	910000	Uh, oh, yeah.
910000	912200	No, we're just celebrating our points.
912200	914600	Hey hungry for points.
914600	917500	Do you eat the Jackalope?
917500	922300	Oh, do you eat Jackalope?
922300	926600	No, rabbit stew.
926600	928600	I oh goodness.
928600	931500	No, I have you ever been to Charlie's next to the foundry.
931500	936100	They all kind of laugh at each other and are giggling amongst themselves and in unison.
936100	939200	They say we don't need to eat.
939200	946100	Uh, how does this Jackalope signify your points or why are you celebrating around it?
946100	947800	Why you are all wearing yellow?
947800	949400	Why is it got a yellow ribbon?
949400	951800	What?
951800	954200	What?
954200	955600	No, that's a great question.
955600	955800	Yeah.
955800	961300	No, so the Jackalopes, they run free and they're not actually Jackalopes.
961300	968800	Yes, I noticed I thought there might be but then the last little part of me that believed in magic died.
968800	970300	That's so sad.
970300	979100	They all kind of laugh like we still have magic here and they kind of laugh some more and she's like earlier this morning.
979100	992400	We had a little contest where we let some rabbits run free and whoever could wrap their ribbon around the the rabbit's head and tie on the antlers to make a Jackalope got points.
992400	993700	I didn't tell you about the points.
993700	995000	The points is the best part.
995000	997400	Well, yeah, we asked but you never quite explained.
997400	998400	What do the points are in you?
998400	999700	Of course I get ahead of myself.
999700	1002000	I'm just so excited and happy to be here.
1002000	1004000	Well, Jennifer, we can certainly see that.
1004000	1008900	No, so I'm so hungry for points because when we get points we could win.
1008900	1010600	Win what?
1010600	1013300	Oh, the prize at the end of each quarter, there's a prize.
1013300	1014500	The fiscal quarter?
1014500	1016100	Yeah, of course.
1016100	1017100	What is the price?
1017100	1019900	Whether the GEs or the EEs win.
1019900	1020900	I'm sorry, EEs?
1020900	1022400	Yeah, excellent employees.
1022400	1024900	There's great employees, there's excellent employees.
1024900	1033300	Those are the green ones and she kind of points around and you see some people who are wearing the same like similar really nice kind of athleisure.
1033400	1037000	But their accents are green as opposed to yellow, which is what?
1037000	1038500	What does green sound like?
1038500	1039000	What?
1039000	1039800	It was a bad joke.
1039800	1041200	Their accents are green.
1041200	1042000	Like Ireland.
1043700	1050600	Excellent employees, are they somehow higher in rank or superior to the great employees?
1050600	1053300	Oh, no, it's just a different word that also means great.
1055000	1057000	It sort of means better than great.
1057000	1058600	Not around here, it doesn't.
1058600	1059300	Okay.
1059300	1061200	How are like teams chosen?
1061200	1067600	Oh, well, when you get hired, you just kind of become either a great employee or an excellent employee.
1067600	1069300	But do you like have a say in it?
1069300	1071200	No, it's just kind of where you fit.
1071200	1075000	Do different departments have different designations?
1075000	1079300	Yeah, the excellent employees work in the lab and the great employees work in the factory.
1079300	1088000	And she points to the lab when she says the lab and the lab is the glass and grass building behind the statues on the north side.
1088000	1092700	And on the east side, just above some perfectly cylindrical trees,
1092700	1101500	she points to the top of a massive greenhouse that is peeking out above these cake pop like trees.
1101500	1104400	Jennifer, you told us earlier you were born here.
1104400	1105300	Born and raised.
1105300	1108000	Were your parents on teams as well?
1108000	1111800	Yeah, my mom was a great employee and my dad was a great employee.
1111800	1117000	Is it typical for the children of great employees to wind up on the same team as their parents or?
1117800	1120000	Not always, but in my case, it worked out.
1120000	1124000	Are you friends with any excellent employees?
1124000	1126800	Not really. We, you know, kind of work in separate places.
1126800	1129700	You know how I assume you guys all work together?
1129700	1132400	Yes, in a small van.
1132400	1138600	Well, then you're probably very close to your co-workers and less close to people you don't work directly with, right?
1138600	1141000	No, I mean, not not like as a rule.
1141000	1145600	Sometimes people you once worked closely with can stab you in the back.
1145600	1147100	Oh, with what?
1147100	1148600	Corporate politics.
1148600	1151700	Wow, that sounds really hard and sad.
1151700	1153800	Like your dad.
1160800	1162400	Are you okay?
1162400	1164400	Yes, yes, but we're not here to ask about me.
1164400	1165400	I'm just fine.
1165400	1168700	We want to know more about you, Jennifer, and what you do here.
1168700	1174900	And as you're kind of looking to Julius, you see a man wearing well-fitted athleisure,
1174900	1182500	monochromatic with green accents, approaches your group confidently with a hand outstretched.
1182500	1185900	Well, hello there, you fine interlopers.
1185900	1189900	What a coincidence indeed to run into you here.
1189900	1192400	My name is Fox Godel.
1192400	1199300	I am the son of my father, Fred Godel, the grandson of my grandfather, Frank Godel,
1199300	1202900	and the future CEO of the Godel company.
1202900	1204800	It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.
1204800	1209300	Would Julius know, has he like seen Fox outside?
1209300	1211000	Like does he go into the real world?
1211000	1212400	Oh, great question.
1212400	1218200	No, you would only know Fox Godel from some pictures that have been on like magazine covers
1218200	1222800	where he's just like posing on a sound stage with his dad just within the past year.
1222800	1223800	How old is he?
1223800	1224800	Yeah.
1224800	1228600	Fox Godel, he seems to be in his mid twenties.
1228600	1231000	Oh, and Zach, last question.
1231000	1235600	How can someone have a monochromatic outfit with colorful accents?
1235600	1236800	Oh, well that's easy.
1236800	1243000	It's just like white, gray, a few different shades of gray, black, and then has like green
1243000	1245000	accents on the side.
1245000	1246000	Not monochromatic.
1247000	1248000	Oh, fuck.
1248000	1250000	It's pretty, it's pretty.
1250000	1251000	Gray scale.
1251000	1252000	Gray scale.
1252000	1253000	Okay.
1253000	1254000	Gray scale.
1254000	1258000	Gray scale with green accents.
1258000	1260000	Monochromatic gray scale with green accents.
1260000	1264000	He got it on the bio farm.
1264000	1266000	Mr. Godel, it is a pleasure to meet you.
1266000	1272400	And he shakes your hand, but then when he goes to shake the hand of Mr. Beck Wilder,
1272400	1279000	he looks up at you, notices the headphones on your head and immediately his eyes glaze
1279000	1284120	over and he gets this horribly tortured look on his face.
1284120	1286600	Was the last person that did that a farmer?
1286600	1287600	Yeah.
1287600	1288600	He was.
1288600	1289600	Yeah.
1289600	1291400	It was the lemon or just some other guy.
1291400	1292400	It was.
1292400	1293400	It was the ticket guy.
1293400	1294400	Right.
1294400	1295400	It was actually, it was Jesse Lemon.
1295400	1296400	Okay.
1296400	1301200	It was the farmer who sold his property to Fred Godel.
1301200	1305300	Zach, can you remind me, did I know, did I figure out that that's what he was looking
1305300	1306520	at at the farm?
1306520	1308600	Did Beck know that it was his headphones?
1308600	1309600	You'd even try it.
1309600	1310600	You even took them off and stuff.
1310600	1311600	Yeah.
1311600	1312600	Yeah.
1312600	1315920	I need everyone to real grip as the look of this man who was just completely normal
1315920	1323800	a moment ago as clearly gone somewhere else inside of his own mind and is trapped seemingly
1323800	1325920	with the disturbing.
1325920	1328600	The lonely stoner seems to free his mind tonight.
1329600	1332000	Yeah, I definitely do not pass.
1332000	1333000	I crit fail.
1333000	1334000	Oh.
1334000	1337000	Oh, I crit failed too, dude.
1337000	1338000	99.
1338000	1339000	It was an 88.
1339000	1341400	Oh, I'm going to spend luck and the other luck you gave me.
1341400	1346000	You can't spend luck because it would just be 99 to switch.
1346000	1348000	Oh, that's right.
1348000	1350000	Well, fuck.
1350000	1352000	You just spent your luck.
1352000	1355000	No, I made it 99.
1355000	1356000	It was the luck.
1356000	1357000	It was and it is.
1357400	1358400	No, I made it 9.9.
1358400	1359400	Oh.
1359400	1362400	Julius, you are going to lose one grip.
1362400	1367400	Beck Wilder, Cal Colorado, you're going to lose two grip each.
1367400	1368400	Well, that's not so bad.
1368400	1370400	Because we saw his face.
1370400	1374400	And I think everybody recognized it was the same thing.
1374400	1376400	It was the headphones that freaked him out.
1376400	1380400	Yeah, that's what's freaking you out is that now you've run into a second person
1380400	1383400	who has had the same reaction to your headphones.
1383800	1388800	Okay, so but it's not like an intrinsic fear like I saw the face of pure evil terror.
1388800	1390800	No, it's not pure evil terror.
1390800	1392800	It's simply just...
1392800	1394800	It's wrong for someone to be scared of a headphone.
1394800	1396800	So afraid of headphones.
1396800	1399800	And then not only that, but unnaturally with the snap of a finger.
1399800	1401800	But there is no snap of any fingers.
1401800	1406800	But if you were to, just he's right back to normal looking at you smiling,
1406800	1408800	going in for a handshake.
1408800	1409800	Nice.
1409800	1410800	What the...
1410800	1411800	What was that?
1412200	1416200	I don't shake his hand because I've now critically failed this grip loss.
1416200	1417200	I think that he...
1417200	1418200	Awesome.
1418200	1419200	What are you doing?
1419200	1420200	If you fail grip, you can't shake his hand.
1420200	1422200	That's the rules.
1422200	1423200	And he kind of...
1423200	1425200	You awkwardly grab too soon and grab his fingers.
1425200	1427200	No, I don't even make a move.
1427200	1431200	And I'm just kind of like startled kind of by how scared he was of me.
1431200	1435200	And maybe I go up like, is there something on my neck?
1435200	1437200	And then I feel the headphones.
1437200	1438200	Oh, fuck.
1438200	1439200	Who is this guy?
1439200	1440200	What's going on here?
1440600	1442600	You know, he pokes you in the belly a little bit.
1442600	1443600	Uh, Julius, like...
1443600	1444600	Like Tife.
1444600	1445600	Definitely...
1445600	1446600	Oh, shit.
1446600	1447600	Yeah, like Tife.
1447600	1451600	Is there somebody in your life who's not respecting your personal boundaries?
1451600	1455600	Because poking people in the belly sucks.
1455600	1456600	That's not a cool thing to do.
1456600	1458600	I guess we just had a couple...
1458600	1459600	Is Taylor...
1459600	1462600	Real rude people on the NPCs so far.
1462600	1466600	Julius is freaked out by that, but not like a crazy amount,
1466600	1469600	but enough that he wants to like address that...
1470000	1472000	But I would like you to...
1472000	1474000	Because you just failed, you didn't critical fail,
1474000	1477000	I'm going to let you roll an alertness check here.
1477000	1479000	But again, because you did fail that check,
1479000	1481000	you're going to be at a negative 20.
1481000	1482000	Pass.
1482000	1485000	A 32, which makes it a 52, on a 70.
1485000	1486000	Fantastic.
1486000	1490000	If I could have Thomas and Joe remove their headphones in La La La,
1490000	1492000	but don't La La La, because you're in the same room.
1492000	1494000	La La La!
1494000	1496000	So what happens?
1496000	1498000	So next, they can't hear,
1498400	1501400	but the next thing that happens
1501400	1505400	is that you actually, you notice that Stevie,
1505400	1509400	her eyes are welling up with tears
1509400	1513400	as she's staring into the face of Fox Gothel
1513400	1516400	as he's having this strange experience.
1516400	1519400	Like, do I recognize that it's from his...
1519400	1522400	I mean, he's doing a real weird fucking thing here
1522400	1525400	and her eyes weren't full of tears a second ago.
1525400	1526400	Gotcha, okay.
1526800	1527800	And then you're back.
1527800	1531800	We all give him the bird.
1531800	1533800	You know what we mean.
1533800	1535800	Julius looks at Fox.
1535800	1537800	What was that...
1537800	1538800	Stevie?
1538800	1540800	Oh, you're Stevie?
1540800	1541800	It's nice to meet you.
1541800	1542800	He puts out his hand and is like,
1542800	1543800	Fox Gothel.
1543800	1544800	And you.
1544800	1545800	So what is your name?
1545800	1548800	Why did you have that look on your face?
1548800	1551800	What, this beautiful grin of mine?
1551800	1554800	So sorry if it was too charming for you.
1555200	1558200	I like point at Beck's headphones.
1558200	1561200	Yeah, and when he looks back, he breaks again
1561200	1564200	and he's just like making this really strange face.
1564200	1567200	It's just pure terror is across
1567200	1570200	and you can just see his lips quivering.
1570200	1573200	His eyes are kind of like darting back and forth.
1573200	1575200	He's not looking even at the headphones anymore
1575200	1578200	and just as soon as you notice it, he's done.
1578200	1580200	But because this just happened
1580200	1583200	and you kind of have a bit of a grip on yourselves this time,
1583600	1584600	the two of you,
1584600	1586600	because you didn't roll alertness last time,
1586600	1588600	you get to roll alertness this time,
1588600	1590600	but because you critically failed last time,
1590600	1592600	I'm going to put you at a negative 20.
1592600	1594600	Real quick, we said Jesse Lemons did sell his farm, right?
1594600	1596600	Jesse Lemon did sell his farm.
1596600	1597600	Yes.
1597600	1599600	I've got a theory, guys.
1599600	1601600	Oh my God.
1604600	1605600	I rolled a hundred.
1605600	1607600	Oh my God.
1607600	1608600	I rolled a one.
1608600	1610600	Oh my God.
1611000	1614000	What the hell is going on tonight?
1614000	1615000	Okay.
1615000	1617000	First, we are going to do Thomas
1617000	1619000	because I don't know what to do with you.
1619000	1621000	I saw your zeros.
1621000	1623000	I was like, hell yeah, dude.
1623000	1625000	So, fuck.
1625000	1628000	Zach, can you take your headphones out and rub your ears?
1628000	1630000	I don't want to have to change shit if we get it right,
1630000	1633000	but I think people are getting Clockwork Orange here.
1633000	1635000	Like, God has some kind of device.
1635000	1637000	Headphones are a major part of it.
1637000	1638000	Yeah.
1638000	1640000	So I'm sure he's done it to control his son.
1640400	1643400	He did it to convince the farmers to sell to him.
1643400	1644400	I like that idea.
1644400	1646400	But it's in some way that they don't remember
1646400	1648400	because they seem kind of aware of themselves.
1648400	1649400	Yeah.
1649400	1651400	Do they have to put ear drops in?
1651400	1653400	Zach?
1656400	1658400	Oh, that was scary.
1658400	1659400	When you were rubbing your ears like that,
1659400	1661400	did you feel like you were back at the big boy show?
1661400	1663400	Oh, dude.
1663400	1665400	Yeah, but my heart wasn't thumping
1665400	1668400	to the point of actual anxiety.
1668800	1670800	It was so fucking great.
1670800	1672800	We were so close and so loud.
1672800	1674800	Absolutely rattling my chest cavity.
1674800	1676800	Yeah, like the way it does
1676800	1678800	when you're fucking 10 years old and you get to go to a show.
1678800	1680800	It was so cool.
1680800	1682800	It was absurd.
1682800	1684800	And we were so close to the front.
1684800	1686800	It was fucking awesome.
1686800	1687800	I had never felt this before,
1687800	1689800	but when I would breathe in through my nose,
1689800	1691800	I could feel it vibrating.
1691800	1693800	It was so weird.
1693800	1695800	So the story behind this is that I was sitting on my couch
1696200	1698200	on Saturday and Luke calls me
1698200	1700200	and says,
1700200	1702200	He's like, hey, what are you doing right now?
1702200	1704200	Well, you're about to edit the podcast.
1704200	1706200	I was about to edit, yeah.
1706200	1708200	I'm like, okay, you're going to Bentonville with us
1708200	1710200	to see Big Boy and Run the Jewels.
1710200	1712200	And then he said he'll be at my house in 10 minutes.
1712200	1714200	So I hung up and changed clothes
1714200	1716200	and then we drove to Bentonville
1716200	1718200	and watched Run the Jewels and Big Boy.
1718200	1720200	It was fucking sick as hell.
1720200	1722200	It was incredible.
1722200	1724200	That venue was pretty cool too.
1724600	1726600	No, it sucked. Walmart sucks.
1726600	1728600	Walmart does suck.
1728600	1730600	The venue sucked. The whole thing sucks.
1730600	1732600	The vans were great.
1732600	1734600	Terrible art. Yeah, the art sucks.
1734600	1736600	That coffee shop blows.
1736600	1738600	Well, it's confusing.
1738600	1740600	It is. There's seats that
1740600	1742600	doesn't look like you're supposed to sit in.
1742600	1744600	It's extremely confusing seating, Joe.
1744600	1746600	It's so confusing.
1746600	1748600	And what's also confusing
1748600	1750600	is the look on Fox Gottel's face.
1750600	1752600	Oh wait, but not to me
1753000	1755000	Oh, that's right. Joe, if I could have
1755000	1757000	you and Luke take your headphones off here.
1757000	1759000	Thomas, you're going to see
1759000	1761000	a couple things here.
1761000	1763000	First off, Stevie
1763000	1765000	is staring directly
1765000	1767000	into the face of Fox
1767000	1769000	Gottel with just
1769000	1771000	this wild sadness.
1771000	1773000	Just this deep
1773000	1775000	struggling pain.
1775000	1777000	Her eyes are welling up with
1777000	1779000	tears. So much
1779000	1781000	so that the wall is about
1781000	1783000	to break, but
1783000	1785000	the dam stays and no
1785000	1787000	tear actually rolls down her face.
1787000	1789000	How old is Stevie? Stevie looks
1789000	1791000	to be maybe in
1791000	1793000	her late 20s, early 30s.
1793000	1795000	Okay, what is the second thing I see?
1795000	1797000	The second thing isn't what you see.
1797000	1799000	It's what you remember.
1799000	1801000	You remember
1801000	1803000	yeah, this is Fox Gottel
1803000	1805000	but it's like a little piece
1805000	1807000	of trivia that you remember.
1807000	1809000	Probably from reading the news.
1809000	1811000	Or even saying it. Exactly.
1811000	1813000	Literally saying it on the news when
1813000	1815000	Fred Gottel had his second
1815000	1817000	born child
1817000	1819000	Greg.
1819000	1821000	That's kind of washing over him
1821000	1823000	but he turns around and looks at
1823000	1825000	Stevie and he mouths
1825000	1827000	Faith?
1827000	1829000	Her eyes
1829000	1831000	get fucking huge.
1831000	1833000	Fucking Gottem.
1833000	1835000	Gottel!
1835000	1837000	Gottel!
1837000	1839000	Sweet.
1839000	1841000	The way that I was rubbing my fingers in my ear
1841000	1843000	most of the time it was
1843000	1845000	but my finger slipped once and I heard
1845000	1847000	Thomas go MOUTH!
1855000	1857000	I bet he just said like mouth but because
1857000	1859000	you were rubbing, it was just like so
1859000	1861000	loud coming through. That's so great.
1861000	1863000	I was doing it to the beat of
1863000	1865000	My House by Flo Rida.
1867000	1869000	So I was going to say to add some character
1869000	1871000	flavor to it I was trying to think why would he fail
1871000	1873000	this alertness role and it's because
1873000	1875000	all Beck's life he's been
1875000	1877000	a goofball and
1877000	1879000	maybe the worst he's ever gotten
1879000	1881000	in response to that is disappointment
1881000	1883000	and maybe some disgust sometimes when he's
1883000	1885000	like a slob. To see
1885000	1887000	himself elicit like
1887000	1889000	carnal fear in somebody
1889000	1891000	he's like what the fuck?
1891000	1893000	There's something wrong with me all of a sudden.
1893000	1895000	I'm broken. Right. Holy shit.
1895000	1897000	Which makes you trip backwards
1897000	1899000	squishing the
1899000	1901000	rabbit underneath your
1901000	1903000	feet and falling
1903000	1905000	directly on the
1905000	1907000	antlers impaling
1907000	1909000	your upper thigh.
1909000	1911000	Fuck dude. I guess that is
1911000	1913000	a fucking crit fail.
1913000	1915000	Holy shit. You lose four
1915000	1917000	hit points as you
1917000	1919000	start bleeding out.
1919000	1921000	Get a doctor. Mr. Gothel.
1921000	1923000	Get a doctor immediately.
1923000	1925000	Fuck.
1925000	1927000	I don't actually
1927000	1929000	oh right a doctor
1929000	1931000	right. Damn it man.
1931000	1933000	Move. Thankfully someone else
1933000	1935000	comes up it's one of the people
1935000	1937000	in yellow athleisure
1937000	1939000	comes up and is like
1939000	1941000	oh my goodness do you need a doctor?
1941000	1943000	Okay right away and they pull
1943000	1945000	out this device out of their
1945000	1947000	pocket and it looks like a futuristic
1947000	1949000	like Star Trek
1949000	1951000	speaker system it's actually
1951000	1953000	you know what it's um they're called
1953000	1955000	tricorders in Star Trek. Okay no I'm not
1955000	1957000	going to do that. Does it have like a big
1957000	1959000	talkie grill kind of thing? Yeah it's

1965000	1967000	wah wah wah wah. Yes exactly.
1967000	1969000	Like a CB radio thing. Yeah almost like a
1969000	1971000	CB radio and she grabs it and
1971000	1973000	and clicks in and is like doctor
1973000	1975000	I need a doctor to the south side
1975000	1977000	of the park immediately
1977000	1979000	immediately we're on the track yeah we're

2029000	2031000	Fox immediately whips back around and is like

2241000	2243000	having this conversation this early
2243000	2245000	but Zach's like
2245000	2247000	fuck there's just some really
2247000	2249000	fucked up shit okay do you trust me
2249000	2251000	Beck looks to Cal
2251000	2253000	Stevie you are the finest
2253000	2255000	gopher we've ever had
2255000	2257000	on this crew thank you can we
2257000	2259000	trust these people with our Beck
2259000	2261000	is he safe in their hands in their
2261000	2263000	medical care yeah he'll get the best
2263000	2265000	medical care available we'll
2265000	2267000	be allowed to go with him I bet well first of all
2267000	2269000	we will not be separated
2269000	2271000	from Beck sure yeah I don't
2271000	2273000	think that'll be a problem Beck is looking
2273000	2275000	really pale and he's
2275000	2277000	slurring even more than he usually does
2277000	2279000	cause there's a thin yellow like fucking
2279000	2281000	wrapping paper ribbon
2281000	2283000	laughter
2283000	2285000	laughter
2285000	2287000	this may be like the most
2287000	2289000	fortuitous of things because this
2289000	2291000	like it is into like their like
2291000	2293000	medical facilities and
2293000	2295000	once you're there it seems like you'd have access to
2295000	2297000	a lot of things like hospitals
2297000	2299000	are like centrally located in most
2299000	2301000	facilities yeah if they
2301000	2303000	let us out it'll be at the lab so
2303000	2305000	it'll be fine Stevie
2305000	2307000	were you born here yeah
2307000	2309000	when you yeah dude when did you
2309000	2311000	get out or were the Godel children
2311000	2313000	always allowed out no I got out like a
2313000	2315000	year ago my god that's
2315000	2317000	when I think when um
2317000	2319000	I think that's when Greg got got
2319000	2321000	Beck is now thinking about
2321000	2323000	it to himself and then makes eye contact
2323000	2325000	with Stevie and then
2325000	2327000	wiggles his headphones at her
2327000	2329000	yeah
2329000	2331000	you can probably answer this
2331000	2333000	what's the deal with the food
2333000	2335000	on the train why can't any outside food
2335000	2337000	come in oh yeah that's why I got you guys
2337000	2339000	all amped up on caffeine before we
2339000	2341000	got in it's uh
2341000	2343000	you can't have any caffeine or drugs
2343000	2345000	in here all the stuff that they
2345000	2347000	have doesn't actually have caffeine in it
2347000	2349000	it's just like if you have caffeine
2349000	2351000	in your system you won't
2351000	2353000	be able to
2353000	2355000	get got
2355000	2357000	that's fucking dark
2357000	2359000	Beck is gonna be bulletproof here he
2359000	2361000	drank like 40 of these
2361000	2363000	so the people
2363000	2365000	here are all under some kind of control
2365000	2367000	yeah and that's what we're trying
2367000	2369000	to show I'm assuming it's some kind of
2369000	2371000	you've fucking seen it you've all seen it
2371000	2373000	kind of headphone device no
2373000	2375000	it's just and then Fox walks up and he's like
2375000	2377000	hey what are you guys talking about
2377000	2379000	I punch him in the face
2379000	2381000	headphones headphones headphones headphones

2385000	2387000	oh my god
2387000	2389000	I just lift one of Beck's
2389000	2391000	earphones like away from his ear
2391000	2393000	and let it fall back and like point at it
2393000	2395000	when he comes to you guys are like walking
2395000	2397000	and we're whistling
2397000	2399000	at this point
2399000	2401000	Fox comes up and he's
2401000	2403000	kind of talking to you guys and you see
2403000	2405000	that the medical staff has
2405000	2407000	arrived and they came on

2419000	2421000	Beck situated on this
2421000	2423000	on this stretcher kind of situation
2423000	2425000	comfortably sitting and
2425000	2427000	they begin walking everyone
2427000	2429000	kind of down the trail
2429000	2431000	along the west
2431000	2433000	walkway up toward the lab

2447000	2449000	medical nonsense and

2477000	2479000	I can take credit for that I believe I
2479000	2481000	dreamt it as a child and made a
2481000	2483000	drawing that my father made a reality
2483000	2485000	that's rad
2485000	2487000	could we take a rain check on

2497000	2499000	much care for that one and he points at Cal
2499000	2501000	he's like you had a nice handshake too
2501000	2503000	but you're a bit of a dick
2503000	2505000	sir you have ignored
2505000	2507000	the medical emergency of our co-worker
2507000	2509000	you tried to
2509000	2511000	refuse a medical service
2511000	2513000	and now you seem to want to
2513000	2515000	separate us from our friend
2515000	2517000	now I assure you I could be very nice to you
2517000	2519000	and very beneficial
2519000	2521000	for your business if we
2521000	2523000	perhaps get the message you want
2523000	2525000	on the air but you have
2525000	2527000	to talk to us first why don't you come
2527000	2529000	along with us dude I can like totally
2529000	2531000	film the interview from the bed
2531000	2533000	I would like to be on camera
2533000	2535000	okay you got me there
2535000	2537000	and he continues walking alongside
2537000	2539000	of each of you
2539000	2541000	looks over at Beck and Cal
2541000	2543000	you're also very handsome
2543000	2545000	I deeply appreciate that
2545000	2547000	of course I do
2547000	2549000	wow Julius
2549000	2551000	very kind
2551000	2553000	very kind indeed
2553000	2555000	I was trying to just
2555000	2557000	write quickly down what has happened so far
2557000	2559000	and one of my favorite things I think I've ever
2559000	2561000	written in my notes is I fell on a
2561000	2563000	jackalope
2563000	2565000	it's not at all
2565000	2567000	what I expected to happen tonight
2567000	2569000	I fell on a jackalope
2571000	2573000	and we passed up a chance to see jizz
2573000	2575000	Beck fell on
2575000	2577000	a jackalope is honestly someday
2577000	2579000	how I expect to hear that actual
2579000	2581000	Beck died
2583000	2585000	holy shit
2585000	2587000	where do Scientologists go when they die
2587000	2589000	hell
2593000	2595000	on the way there you guys all see a woman
2595000	2597000	who is kind of turning the corner
2597000	2599000	she's coming from the lab
2599000	2601000	statue area right
2601000	2603000	turning the corner heading down the walkway
2603000	2605000	toward you and you see that she is
2605000	2607000	a pencil of a woman
2607000	2609000	with bouncy spiky
2609000	2611000	hair on top of her head
2611000	2613000	Mr. Gotl you have pencil people here
2617000	2619000	roll grip
2619000	2621000	yeah
2623000	2625000	literally imagining that's my number two
2629000	2631000	just about to say
2631000	2633000	I'm imagining a number two like
2633000	2635000	bouncing down the road
2635000	2637000	fresh shape
2639000	2641000	this total beaker of a woman
2641000	2643000	is just like
2643000	2645000	notices you all and then
2645000	2647000	bounces away
2647000	2649000	yeah just gonna
2649000	2651000	running though
2651000	2653000	back from whence she came
2653000	2655000	so wait wait
2655000	2657000	did she just come towards us and turn around
2657000	2659000	yep she came out
2659000	2661000	turned the corner saw you guys
2661000	2663000	immediately started running in the
2663000	2665000	opposite direction and
2665000	2667000	Fox is like oh Barbara
2667000	2669000	off to go run
2669000	2671000	and see her old husband
2671000	2673000	probably freaking out that he didn't
2673000	2675000	meet you guys at the gate huh
2675000	2677000	who is that
2677000	2679000	oh Chuck Bidwell
2679000	2681000	Chuck Bidwell and Barbara Bidwell
2681000	2683000	Chuck is our well he's not the mayor
2683000	2685000	but he's
2685000	2687000	no no of course not
2687000	2689000	I'm not the mayor but you know
2689000	2691000	Chuck is the guy who kind of
2691000	2693000	does everything that the mayor should do
2693000	2695000	yeah like a city manager
2695000	2697000	yeah kind of like that yeah
2697000	2699000	and you're saying he should have met us at the gate
2699000	2701000	well I would assume that that's why
2701000	2703000	Barbara was running off like that
2703000	2705000	she's kind of his keeper
2705000	2707000	I suppose
2707000	2709000	Cal glances back to make sure
2709000	2711000	he's been rolling this whole time
2711000	2713000	Mr. Gottle
2713000	2715000	what would a city manager handle here
2715000	2717000	do they handle taxes
2717000	2719000	well yes of course I would assume
2719000	2721000	yeah they would handle all sorts of business
2721000	2723000	sides of things but of course
2723000	2725000	taxes because of course you
2725000	2727000	pay these employees
2727000	2729000	well obviously we have to
2729000	2731000	pay our employees in
2731000	2733000	money? uh yeah
2733000	2735000	US dollars
2735000	2737000	or points which one would you
2737000	2739000	like to hear I actually
2739000	2741000	I'm a bit of
2741000	2743000	afraid to say I don't know the answer
2743000	2745000	to that question I am a bit
2745000	2747000	more of the hang out in my
2747000	2749000	GIZ and kick it kind of guy
2749000	2751000	so to your knowledge sir you
2751000	2753000	do not pay your employees anything
2753000	2755000	well I wouldn't be the one paying him now
2755000	2757000	would I I'm the future CEO
2757000	2759000	of the Gottle company but not the
2759000	2761000	current CEO as he points up at the statues
2761000	2763000	ahead he says see uh
2763000	2765000	not a statue up there yet but
2765000	2767000	sir how much does a gallon of milk cost
2767000	2769000	commissioning it
2769000	2771000	a gallon of milk
2771000	2773000	god I don't know um
2773000	2775000	pffff
2775000	2777000	seven
2777000	2779000	seven
2779000	2781000	seven dollars
2781000	2783000	dammit he's right
2783000	2785000	is everyone here
2785000	2787000	vegan or vegetarian
2787000	2789000	well no one eats meat or meat
2789000	2791000	byproducts uh I
2791000	2793000	guess that's what you might call vegan yeah
2793000	2795000	pretty rough move when he came in there
2795000	2797000	Beck stepping
2797000	2799000	on an animal like that that's uh
2799000	2801000	not a way to make a good impression around here
2801000	2803000	this rings true for
2803000	2805000	Beck he's kind of feeling bad that he
2805000	2807000	fell on a jackalope
2807000	2809000	was the rabbit okay
2809000	2811000	I didn't even check sure
2811000	2813000	Beck yeah cool
2813000	2815000	it wasn't oh
2815000	2817000	I think he killed it it was at least
2817000	2819000	a swift end
2819000	2821000	I saw it cry
2827000	2829000	I've never like
2829000	2831000	killed an animal before
2831000	2833000	and at this point you guys have kind of made your way up
2833000	2835000	to the front here and it's a sight
2835000	2837000	to behold this is a massive
2837000	2839000	glass building
2839000	2841000	three stories tall
2841000	2843000	but extremely wide
2843000	2845000	taking up the whole north side of this
2845000	2847000	park square and
2847000	2849000	in front of it massive
2849000	2851000	26.3
2851000	2853000	meter tall statues
2853000	2855000	of this green rock
2855000	2857000	and up close you see
2857000	2859000	an immense amount of detail
2859000	2861000	hey Zach would that happen to be 69 feet
2861000	2863000	no
2863000	2865000	it does seem like
2865000	2867000	I literally just did the math in my head at 78.9
2867000	2869000	but I
2869000	2871000	did the math because I was like that's probably
2871000	2873000	69
2873000	2875000	we covered a lot
2875000	2877000	we got a lot of fantastic
2877000	2879000	footage of
2879000	2881000	Godel just being just incriminating
2881000	2883000	himself really
2883000	2885000	oh are you still filming from the
2885000	2887000	I never
2887000	2889000	got the camera hand off to
2889000	2891000	Stevie
2891000	2893000	but I think that made it more
2893000	2895000	a little more discreet
2895000	2897000	it's all like the cover of
2897000	2899000	Rubber Soul where it's all kind of looking up
2899000	2901000	at everybody's faces and just swiveling
2901000	2903000	it's a really rad dolly shot there
2903000	2905000	it's a walk and talk
2905000	2907000	yeah it's a total walk and talk
2907000	2909000	down low angle
2909000	2911000	Joe loves his sorkin
2911000	2913000	you know it
2913000	2915000	fuck
2915000	2917000	and as you guys are walking down at the very end
2917000	2919000	you see a
2919000	2921000	maybe not yet
2921000	2923000	pterodactyl
2923000	2925000	another jackalope
2925000	2927000	oh god
2927000	2929000	it's gonna haunt me for the rest of my life
2929000	2931000	this one has a
2931000	2933000	purple ribbon
2933000	2935000	never mind it's not the same one
2935000	2937000	Cal leans over at his TV
2937000	2939000	hey what
2939000	2941000	there's purple
2941000	2943000	is there a purple team?
2943000	2945000	Fox you notice kind of runs over
2945000	2947000	to it removes the ribbon
2947000	2949000	puts the ribbon in his pocket
2949000	2951000	and then starts walking away
2951000	2953000	from you all back
2953000	2955000	toward where you came from
2955000	2957000	kind of toward where you
2957000	2959000	he's kind of pointed at his house
2959000	2961000	he's just kind of walking away
2961000	2963000	whistling with his hands in his pockets
2963000	2965000	once again
2965000	2967000	Mr. Godle, Mr. Godle
2967000	2969000	Fox
2969000	2971000	I throw some headphones at him
2971000	2973000	roll athletics
2973000	2975000	to see if you can throw
2975000	2977000	at a negative 20
2977000	2979000	to see if you can throw a pair of headphones
2979000	2981000	and I assume you grab
2981000	2983000	I've got a 10% chance
2983000	2985000	you grab Bex
2985000	2987000	98
2987000	2989000	so you grab Bex
2989000	2991000	headphones from off his head
2991000	2993000	and you throw them without
2993000	2995000	unplugging them from the cord at all
2995000	2997000	and they just kind of immediately
2997000	2999000	swing into the ground
2999000	3001000	and
3001000	3003000	Fox turns around as he's whistling
3003000	3005000	and is kind of like you guys
3005000	3007000	and he's not looking he's just
3007000	3009000	yelling over his shoulder you said
3009000	3011000	you wouldn't leave your friend right?
3011000	3013000	bye it was nice to meet you
3013000	3015000	continues kind of whistling
3015000	3017000	Mr. Godle wait where are we supposed to go?
3017000	3019000	and one of the people walking
3019000	3021000	with you is like
3021000	3023000	oh we'll take care of it
3023000	3025000	and then they notice the headphones on the ground
3025000	3027000	and they're like
3029000	3031000	we just like look at our watches
3031000	3033000	and tap our feet
3035000	3037000	Bex calls after Fox also
3037000	3039000	no interview then or
3039000	3041000	and with that he's gone
3041000	3043000	you guys are now walking past
3043000	3045000	where there's this rabbit
3045000	3047000	just kind of hopping along
3047000	3049000	with a spare pair of antlers
3049000	3051000	hanging out on the ground

3170000	3172000	down on the stairs to where it can slide
3172000	3174000	gently up the stairs and you're walking
3174000	3176000	up the stairs and
3176000	3178000	all of the stairs that you're walking
3178000	3180000	on are grass

3242000	3244000	absolutely not other than
3244000	3246000	perhaps the powdered wig might
3246000	3248000	make her not so much

3250000	3252000	I'm sorry British yeah are you aware of

3294000	3296000	fucking screaming in the back

3298000	3300000	wouldn't pick up on this sir who a judge
3300000	3302000	surprised I didn't have you rolling a negative

3306000	3308000	and you're just like ahhhh
3308000	3310000	the
3310000	3312000	adrenaline has started to wear off a little bit
3312000	3314000	I'm going in and out of consciousness sometimes
3314000	3316000	you look back and my eyes are closed
3316000	3318000	so I passed my ass off
3318000	3320000	who is this judge?
3320000	3322000	both you and Julius notice that
3322000	3324000	the eyes of this judge
3324000	3326000	and Stevie
3326000	3328000	meet
3328000	3330000	like physically touch
3330000	3332000	laughter
3332000	3334000	as she passes
3334000	3336000	she leans in
3336000	3338000	and touches her eyeballs
3338000	3340000	they butterfly kiss
3340000	3342000	could you touch your eye
3342000	3344000	to somebody else's eye couldn't you?
3344000	3346000	yeah you can it's not
3346000	3348000	pleasant probably hurt
3348000	3350000	feels weird we'll try it later
3350000	3352000	I have contacts in then yeah it's protected
3352000	3354000	so you guys see this judge and she is
3354000	3356000	making eyes right they lock and
3356000	3358000	you notice a
3358000	3360000	strange look
3360000	3362000	come over the judge's face but
3362000	3364000	because you know who Stevie
3364000	3366000	is you see
3366000	3368000	a look of recognition
3368000	3370000	on the judge's face as she looks at
3370000	3372000	Faith Godel Stevie is
3372000	3374000	that judge going to blow your cover
3374000	3376000	no I don't think so
3376000	3378000	she knew where I was
3378000	3380000	she's been keeping me safe this whole time so I don't think
3380000	3382000	she'd fuck it up now and then who does
3382000	3384000	she work for? the Godel Company
3384000	3386000	what is your relationship to her?
3386000	3388000	she's
3388000	3390000	nice
3390000	3392000	she's understanding at least
3392000	3394000	maybe not nice
3394000	3396000	she serves as some kind of
3396000	3398000	definitely not nice actually now that I think about it
3398000	3400000	she serves as a judge for this community
3400000	3402000	yeah and at this point
3402000	3404000	you guys are walking through
3404000	3406000	these glass walls
3406000	3408000	there's seemingly no
3408000	3410000	door but the walls
3410000	3412000	kind of lift
3412000	3414000	creating an opening in the whole
3414000	3416000	front of this building and allow
3416000	3418000	you to walk through Cal says
3418000	3420000	neat you continue to walk
3420000	3422000	on grass inside
3422000	3424000	that's fucking sick there are no
3424000	3426000	stairs but suddenly there's an
3426000	3428000	incline of the same synthetic pathway
3428000	3430000	that you saw out on the track
3430000	3432000	and that incline synthetic
3432000	3434000	pathway takes you upstairs
3434000	3436000	so basically you walk up
3436000	3438000	and then you flip a yay
3438000	3440000	and you're facing back the way you came
3440000	3442000	and there's another huge wall
3442000	3444000	of glass that you're looking out and
3444000	3446000	up against that glass there are three
3446000	3448000	stools with this glass backdrop
3448000	3450000	and it faces back the way you came
3450000	3452000	looking out through the glass wall
3452000	3454000	into the beauty
3454000	3456000	and enormity of the park at
3456000	3458000	the city center of Grover's Gorge
3458000	3460000	and on the far stool
3460000	3462000	perched on its
3462000	3464000	plastron which is the belly
3464000	3466000	of a turtle
3466000	3468000	is an extremely old looking
3468000	3470000	common box turtle
3470000	3472000	its head flippers and shell
3472000	3474000	are covered in scratches
3474000	3476000	and scars
3476000	3478000	and it looks damp
3478000	3480000	a makeup artist is attempting to powder
3480000	3482000	it dry while holding
3482000	3484000	the turtle steady by its
3484000	3486000	torn up moist shell
3486000	3488000	Cal reaches a hand out to the
3488000	3490000	turtle and says, Mr. Gotle
3490000	3492000	I presume
3492000	3494000	the makeup artist is like laughing
3494000	3496000	this is just like a normal
3496000	3498000	sized box turtle or is it like big
3498000	3500000	yeah, how big is a box turtle
3500000	3502000	normally, pretty small, yeah so it's like a
3502000	3504000	big box turtle, okay
3504000	3506000	for everybody at home he was putting his hands
3506000	3508000	about this far apart, like the size of my head
3508000	3510000	not that big
3510000	3512000	yeah dude
3512000	3514000	that would be terrifying, how long
3514000	3516000	do box turtles live, oh forever
3516000	3518000	like a lobsters, and god
3518000	3520000	god was
3520000	3522000	never born though, neither were box
3522000	3524000	turtles, whoa
3524000	3526000	box turtles
3526000	3528000	yeah, you're right, box turtles
3528000	3530000	are not born, and do not
3530000	3532000	die
3534000	3536000	box turtles are angels
3536000	3538000	of our lord
3538000	3540000	and says they're right on the
3540000	3542000	wikipedia, dude
3542000	3544000	in the bible, box turtles actually look
3544000	3546000	fucking insane
3546000	3548000	you know, like a big wheel with eyeballs
3548000	3550000	god dammit, biblically accurate
3550000	3552000	turtle
3552000	3554000	its shells instead of eyes
3554000	3556000	box turtles generally
3556000	3558000	live to be about 35 years old
3558000	3560000	but some have been known to survive
3560000	3562000	for um, eternity
3562000	3564000	yeah, that's
3564000	3566000	what I thought, I say all this to the turtle
3568000	3570000	so we were led up here by this
3570000	3572000	medical staff? I thought maybe this was like a
3572000	3574000	waiting room, but then the turtle was
3574000	3576000	getting its makeup then
3576000	3578000	I thought they were
3578000	3580000	maybe disrespecting us very hard
3580000	3582000	yeah, like, we brought you to the
3582000	3584000	vet, you fucking
3586000	3588000	or just like, oh you want to interview somebody?
3588000	3590000	you want to interview, here's our employee of the month
3592000	3594000	boxy
3594000	3596000	one of the medical staff says to you
3596000	3598000	well I think you'll be doing
3598000	3600000	the interview up here and we can just have
3600000	3602000	the medical staff come up and meet you
3602000	3604000	they're based in this building, so
3604000	3606000	oh wait, the interview with mr
3606000	3608000	the mayor
3608000	3610000	oh, with the mayor, mr bidwell
3610000	3612000	no, the mayor
3612000	3614000	and they look at the turtle and they say
3614000	3616000	sandro
3616000	3618000	woah
3618000	3620000	I
3620000	3622000	hey Beck, don't step on the mayor
3622000	3624000	laughter
3652000	3654000	my life
3654000	3656000	is great
3656000	3658000	wait, Mickey Rooney Jr., Buzz Aldrin
3658000	3660000	and Neil Armstrong? and Ryan Gosling
3660000	3662000	I was saying my movie is The First Mouseketeer
3662000	3664000	which is about
3664000	3666000	Mickey Rooney Jr.
3666000	3668000	it's like the fly
3668000	3670000	but instead of a fly, it's a mouse
3670000	3672000	ew
3672000	3674000	ew
3674000	3676000	that seems like a movie they should have tried to remake by now
3676000	3678000	I wouldn't want to live in a Cronenberg
3678000	3680000	have you ever seen the first, like the original
3680000	3682000	the old, old one? no, I haven't seen it
3682000	3684000	it's not very good
3684000	3686000	the one with Jeff Goldblum
3686000	3688000	you know that really old one
3688000	3690000	let's see, the fly remake
3690000	3692000	there's no plans that I can see
3692000	3694000	but there's an article that says
3694000	3696000	the fly continues to make a strong
3696000	3698000	pro remake argument
3700000	3702000	I, oh sorry
3702000	3704000	can I get 30 seconds to sound?
3704000	3706000	and it's all my fault
3710000	3712000	oh
