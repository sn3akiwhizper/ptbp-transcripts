0	7520	Ho, ho, ho, my babies, it's your number one gift giver and home invader, Wolfy Claws.
7520	12520	And I'm here to throw copious amounts of garbage down your chimneys at night, whether you've
12520	15080	been naughty or nice.
15080	21200	Hope you put that fire out, because my gifts of garbage are good and grease-filled, baby.
21200	29920	And as always, we are delivering all that unholy holiday cheer live from 694.2 PTBP.
29920	32120	What's that smell in the air?
32120	34680	Is it holiday cheer and joy?
34680	40880	Is it the smoldering ashes of a house I accidentally ignited into flame from throwing greasy garbage
40880	42520	down their chimneys?
42520	45400	No, it's Howlin' with Wolf.
45400	49880	This week we got a new Howlin' with Wolf, and it comes from someone very close to my
49880	50880	heart.
50880	54920	Dear Wolf the Dog, You are handsome, you are beautiful.
54920	57520	When you command, people obey.
57520	65000	You are the master of trash, a savant of meat drippings, an academic of pandemics.
65000	71120	Just wanted to let you know how special you are to everyone, especially me, baby.
71120	74560	With great admiration, Wolf the Dog.
74560	77440	Now damn, that was a nice letter.
77440	79960	We should get more like that, I think.
79960	84700	This kind being must have massive intellect to compose such a letter.
84700	88600	If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, remember to hit us up on one
88600	92500	of the various forms of social media and tag us.
92500	99820	Or give us a 5 star review on iTunes and all that jazz and send us a damn email for wolf's
99820	100820	sake.
100820	104260	Pretendinpod at gmail dot com, baby.
104260	111300	Also if you love the show like I do, consider becoming a subscriber over on patreon dot
111300	114040	com slash pretendinpod.
114040	117760	We got some nice exclusives for y'all over there.
117760	121800	Speaking of transition, it's the news.
121800	126380	Leon Dunn murdered some cops while leaving Bruce Robin's office.
126380	132720	The city PD tried to catch them contention boys, but the fast and furious car chase ended
132720	139120	after Keith threw a shotgun at the lead car so hard it buried itself into the driver,
139120	144760	causing the CPD cruiser to swerve and flip an absurd number of times.
144760	151080	The wake of destruction got to John and Clark, and they dived into their own consciousnesses,
151080	156400	unresponsive and chanting the numbers that translate to Bruce Robin.
156400	161040	Right before they snapped out of their weird trance-like state, Keith learned an ominous
161040	163480	fact from Leon Simpson.
163480	169620	Apparently Clark Bishop is the overseer, and in his future he will go back to the past
169620	172320	and found the circle of knowledge.
172320	174320	So uh, that's fun.
174320	179640	Y'all it's time to introduce a new one never heard before on this station.
179640	186760	It's my favorite Christmas song of all time, one that inspires joy and happiness to all
186760	188560	far and wide.
188560	196240	No matter the dimension, no matter the timeline, it's Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas
196240	200320	Is Kudzu With No Backbone.
218560	234800	Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore, you come to and you are sitting in the car with Leon
234800	244080	Simpson and Keith Vigna, and you are in a parking lot of CSU, City State University.
244080	249760	And Leon and Keith are just, Keith especially, is just...
249760	254520	I'm staring at you, mouth agape, like...
254520	255520	Keith?
255520	256520	Um...
256520	257520	Uh...
257520	258520	Uh...
258520	259520	Where...
259520	260520	Do you know?
260520	261520	Know...
261520	262520	Know what?
262520	263520	Where are we?
263520	264800	Yeah, I'm cool.
264800	269280	Leon touches your arm, Keith, and he says, it might not be time.
269280	270280	Oh, fuck.
270280	272620	I look at Leon, time for what?
272660	274500	Time for you guys to head on out.
274500	279500	So here's what I'm thinking, Keith and, what's your name, John?
279500	284180	If Keith and John want to go in from this way, her dorm is this next one right up here
284180	292380	and he points at a building, and you see the entire campus of CSU is dripping in holiday
292380	294380	festivities.
294380	299580	Before we get out of the car, I want to hand Clark the folder with the pictures and stuff
299580	300580	in it.
300580	302060	Do you remember what you were just doing?
302060	307540	We were in a car chase, I shot out a tire, I guess I don't remember how we got here though.
307540	311860	You and John were, you were just chanting those numbers.
311860	312860	Bruce Robin.
312860	314460	Nah, that didn't sound like us.
314460	315460	Over and over and over again.
315460	317100	I don't remember saying those numbers.
317100	318540	It was pretty freaky.
318540	324300	And when you open up the envelope, you see the inside of a dorm room that is a crime
324300	325300	scene.
325300	330300	Police tape is up and there are little, like, placards, you know, for evidence all over
330340	336820	the place and spray painted all over the walls and even, like, on the bed sheets and, like,
336820	340940	pillowcases and the desk and really anything.
340940	350820	Spray painted on there is 1-5-2-2-5-1-8-1-9-5-5-1-8.
350820	351820	I decoded that.
351820	353460	What's it say, Keith?
353460	355460	It says overseer.
355460	358020	Oh, that's what they called you.
358020	360900	Remember that thing, that thing at the funeral?
360900	363100	Yeah, the creepy thing.
363100	366140	Look at those numbers and I think that's what it called you.
366140	368340	That can't be right.
368340	370460	How, that wouldn't make...
370460	375020	What's stranger about that than, you know, anything we've experienced since the start
375020	379340	of this podcast?
379340	383100	Clark and I look at Leon.
383100	384100	I look at Leon too.
384100	385100	I look at you.
385100	387860	Why won't nobody look at me?
387860	392740	Leon, can you just, can you just tell him?
392740	398100	Keith, John, if you guys take the dorm room, Clark and I will head around to the other
398100	401980	side and get into the administration building.
401980	404180	Do you think I'm the overseer?
404180	405180	Yes.
405180	408540	What does that mean to you?
408540	414140	Clark, it's better not to think about it too much right now as it seems to be...
414140	415140	I don't know.
415140	416140	I was just telling Keith here.
416140	421620	I don't know if I believe in destiny anymore, but if the prophecies are true, then you will
421620	426060	eventually start the circle of knowledge in the past.
426060	427380	That sounds right.
427380	430980	Your old wizard self is running all over the fucking place in time, so...
430980	434820	Remember that book you found that had the drawing in it?
434820	438580	If Leon's right, that's, I think that's you.
438580	444300	Clark is doing what I'm doing now, sitting in stunned silence, mulling it all over.
444300	446140	Why'd you tell that girl to kill herself, man?
446140	448020	Do you remember what was written in that book?
448020	450540	It is only in death that he may rise again.
450540	451540	Yeah.
451540	452540	Horseshoes and hand grenades.
452540	453900	What did it actually say?
453900	457100	It is only through death that he may rise again.
457100	458100	Oh.
458100	459100	Pretty much nailed it.
459100	461740	Yeah, that was real good without consulting notes or anything.
461740	464520	I don't know why you ribbed him on that.
464520	466300	So do we have to kill Clark or...
466300	467540	No, no, God no.
467540	469740	I mean, Clark is our greatest asset.
469740	473140	I didn't know anything about that starting the circle thing, but Maggie did tell me that
473140	477080	that's kind of the whole point of the circle of knowledge, wasn't it to bring about the
477080	478080	Overseer?
478080	479080	Isn't that what she told me?
479080	487740	In a way, yes, but it's a matter of the end-of-the-world scenario that we've heard is perhaps coming
487740	493980	can pretty much only be stopped by the Overseer, so we're really hoping that you show up later
493980	494980	now.
494980	498460	Clark throws up.
498460	499500	The world?
499500	500500	It's just the world.
500500	501980	Hey, you got this, buddy.
501980	505340	Leon, there's a huge flaw here in this whole thing.
505340	506340	I don't do magic.
506340	507340	I don't know how to do magic.
507340	509100	Do you know how to do magic?
509100	510100	No.
510100	512860	I didn't even know magic was the thing until I saw Old Me.
512860	516200	You obviously do in the past when your future self creates it.
516200	517620	Does the circle know magic?
517620	519700	Can you teach me to do magic?
519700	521080	It's not really magic.
521080	522080	I've never seen...
522080	524380	Where is your sense of wonder, Leon?
524380	528380	Honestly, I've seen too much to wonder about anything anymore.
528380	529880	Have you talked to the Old Me?
529880	534000	Do you know that Old Me has been sticking his hands in our daily lives for the last
534000	535000	few days?
535000	536000	No, what?
536000	539920	Have you seen the video of the monkey who sticks his whole hand up a pug's butthole?
539920	542360	Yes, but hold on, what was the other thing?
542360	543520	That's what he's been doing to us.
543520	548160	I watch that every night before I go to sleep, but I haven't seen...
548160	549160	You're saying that...
549160	553900	Like John said, like a monkey sticking its whole hand up a pug's butthole.
553900	557680	He's been messing in our business, and we jump like that pug.
557680	558680	We don't like it.
558680	571240	What rude monkey is Old Clark?
571240	574160	What do you know about that?
574160	579960	I mean, obviously I know a lot about the monkey pug asshole stuff, but I'm very curious to
579960	584800	hear about the ways in which Old Clark has put his fist inside of you.
584800	585800	Don't get weird with it.
585800	587120	No, no, no, you know what I mean.
587120	589680	Just follow along with in the game we're playing.
589680	593700	It seems as though he's been helping us in sort of indiscriminate ways.
593700	597320	He tried to warn us a long time ago when none of us were around.
597320	601240	He went and talked to Drew and told him something terrible was going to happen.
601240	602240	That was Old Clark?
602240	603240	It wasn't me.
603240	604640	I thought that was just a double.
604640	608320	Well, if he's time traveling, I guess it could be a younger but not the oldest.
608320	609400	Oh, man.
609400	610400	These are ancient mysteries.
610400	611680	I don't know how it works.
611680	614560	We saw him in the mausoleum too.
614560	616760	He did something to us.
616760	617760	What do you mean?
617760	619380	I show whichever one.
619380	620380	What's on my chest again?
620380	621380	Marvin.
621380	622380	Marvin.
622380	623380	And it's crossed out.
623380	624380	What's on my hand?
624380	625380	Tildy.
625380	626380	I'm going to show him that one.
626380	628360	He branded us with a name.
628360	633200	He branded you with a metal hot stick or like a spell.
633200	634880	And I hold out my hand too.
634880	638620	I hold out my, no, I'm not going to slap him.
638620	641240	I hold out my hand.
641240	642240	Look real close.
642240	643240	Watch the birdie.
643240	646720	I hold out the opposite hand to the one they're holding and then smack me with the other one.
646720	649440	It hurts really bad when you hit him with the one that's painted.
649440	650440	I don't hit him.
650440	652840	I just solemnly hold my hand up with the others.
652840	657040	I don't, I can't, the only thing I can assume is it was magic.
657040	658720	He held up a scroll.
658720	659720	Joe's asking that.
659720	663520	I think he held up a scroll and the words alighted and then we blacked out.
663520	668440	Yeah, he held up some kind of parchment and the words lit up and we blacked out.
668440	670440	I just assumed it was magic of some kind.
670440	674460	Yeah, I don't know what to call it, but the world definitely doesn't play by the rules
674460	680020	that we believed and were taught that it did and part of the circle of knowledge is
680020	686900	keeping that truth a secret from the general public because the minute that this goes wide,
686900	687900	chaos will ensue.
687900	691520	Not if he's like regulated, like set up a Hogwarts.
691520	694060	That is an extremely good point, Jon.
694060	695060	Thank you.
695060	696060	Maybe season two.
696060	702980	Yeah, fuck yeah, Jon as Dumbledore, right in on the discord if you want to see that.
702980	707020	If you don't think that the overseer would be Dumbledore, then I don't know what to tell
707020	708020	you.
708020	710540	Wouldn't the overseer be doing more important stuff?
710540	711540	He's Voldemort.
711540	712540	Yeah.
712540	716460	I touched your kids and I'm pretty sure they touched me too.
716460	718500	Leon, Dewey Cox.
718500	721060	We uh, that's Dewey Jack Black.
721060	722060	Dewey Finn.
722060	723060	Fuck.
723060	724060	Sorry.
724060	728820	Leon, we have other names, not embroidered, we have other names written on us.
728820	730660	Clark shoots, uh, Kila Glantz.
730660	731660	Yeah, I don't.
731660	732660	I sure don't.
733340	734340	Nevermind.
734340	739460	Well, you guys seem to be having some inner turmoil here, which will lead me to my point.
739460	740640	We are running out of time.
740640	741640	We need to get in here.
741640	742940	We need to make this quick.
742940	745420	So, my plan split up.
745420	749460	Two of you and two of us and we'll get this taken care of.
749460	756240	All right now, Keith and Jon, I think you guys have the best chance at going in and
756240	758900	figuring out what happened in the dorm room.
758900	760900	Talk to her roommate.
760900	762820	Talk to anyone who is friends with her.
762820	764200	Try to get the run down.
764200	768620	They will have already been talked to by the city police, so you're going to have to convince
768620	771980	them that there's a reason that you're re-interviewing them.
771980	778060	Clark, we're going to go ahead and sneak into the administration building and pull files.
778060	779060	All right?
779060	782140	Uh, I guess if you say so, if you think that's best.
782140	785780	That's what, I don't even know what, what are we, what are we doing, Leon?
785780	786780	What's going on?
786780	791780	We need to figure out if Harriet Marks is the beginning of this or if she passed it
791780	793780	on whatever it is.
793780	795940	Do you have an inkling on what it is?
795940	799140	Well, it seems to pass from person to person.
799140	805680	Perhaps, you know, Bruce Robin quote unquote got it, whatever it is from Harriet Marks.
805680	808300	She got it or whatever it is from the Overseer.
808300	809300	You guys.
809300	810300	Are you saying it follows?
810300	812140	I mean, it seems to pass.
812140	814940	Wait, you know that Harriet got it from the Overseer?
815180	817900	Look at the, look at the numbers all over a dorm room.
817900	820420	Any points of the pictures that are in your lap?
820420	821420	Oh.
821420	825660	So it gives the name of the last person who had it, is that the theory?
825660	827780	We were writing down Bruce.
827780	828780	What was Bruce writing down?
828780	829780	He was writing down Harriet.
829780	830780	Got it.
830780	831780	I see what you're saying.
831780	832780	And Harriet was writing the Overseer.
832780	836660	It's just a theory, but if it starts with the Overseer, we need to figure out why you
836660	837660	made this happen.
837660	839420	I mean, I didn't.
839420	843620	I understand that it's not you, but we need to figure out why future past you made this
843620	844620	happen.
845300	850580	Let's call him Clark, Clark, Clark, old, let's call him Clark old just so I don't feel like
850580	853260	you guys are accusing me of shit I didn't do.
853260	858340	No, old dick is really good, but let's stick with Clark old.
858340	861660	I mean, how do you expect us to find that out?
861660	864180	Your cops do your interrogation work.
864180	868020	From what I've heard, you guys are real good at putting guns in people's faces and making
868020	869020	them talk.
869020	870020	I point my gun in his face.
870020	872060	I'm like, you don't know a goddamn thing about us.
872060	873100	And he just keeps talking.
873140	874460	I got an idea, fellas.
874460	880180	If you take a picture of me and use a filter to oldify me, then you got a picture of me.
880180	882140	Ask if people have seen him around.
882140	883140	Face app.
883140	884140	I snap a pic.
884140	885260	I smile real big.
885260	886260	Snap a pic.
886260	890060	GRUS8 is definitely going to get in on this.
890060	892060	That's the, uh, nevermind.
892060	894740	I'm going to cut that.
894740	897300	Sorry about the Internet Research Agency.
897300	899220	Some Delta Green lore.
899220	901220	Oh, great.
901220	902220	Okay.
902340	906780	Well, I guess, uh, should we go to, go to her door?
906780	907780	You killed the vibe, nerd.
907780	908780	I know.
908780	918380	All right, get the fuck out of my, come on, let's, uh, let's, let's make this happen,
918380	919380	captain.
919380	920380	Okay.
920380	921380	I mean, I guess let's go to her dorm then, John.
921380	922380	I'm following you.
922380	923380	All right.
923380	924380	Let's split up.
932220	943140	Hey Joe, Clark is sitting in the back of the car.
943140	948820	John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna get out, start walking toward the dorm.
948820	953740	Leon puts the car in reverse and starts driving out of the parking lot.
953740	958940	I need you to roll either a human or an alertness, whichever is higher.
958940	962540	My alertness is higher.
962540	963700	I crit pass.
963700	964700	I crit pass.
964700	965700	I got a one.
965700	968860	I got a zero zero one.
968860	970660	I got a 33.
970660	972660	That's fucking wild.
972660	973660	Is a one better than a 33?
973660	974900	I think a one is better than a 33.
974900	975900	It sounds like it should be better to me.
975900	979740	I think a one is like the ultimate crit.
979740	981020	I'm so sorry, Zach.
981020	982220	I don't know how I do it.
982220	986020	You do never, hey, never apologize.
986020	987300	Never apologize, baby.
987300	988820	All right, shit.
988820	989820	Are you ready for this?
989820	992060	I know, but go.
992060	1001700	You notice Leon's free hand is reaching and he grabs a gun out from under the shotgun
1001700	1007980	seat, like in between the console and the shotgun seat, and he's moving it to aim it
1007980	1008980	at you.
1008980	1010740	And it's not a normal gun.
1010740	1013980	It looks like the tranq gun that he gave you earlier.
1013980	1021100	So instead of him just firing it into you, we are now going to roll against each other,
1021100	1022220	depending on what you want to do.
1022220	1026900	Well, I would like to kick the back of his chair to throw the aim of the gun off.
1026900	1027900	Fantastic.
1027900	1032980	So you're going to roll unarmed combat and he's going to roll at a negative 40 of firearms
1032980	1036900	and we'll see how this plays out.
1036900	1038620	He's got a 80% in firearms.
1038620	1040180	No, sorry, 70.
1040180	1042100	So he's going to go down to 30.
1042100	1048380	I'm going to use brand new dice that I've never touched before.
1048380	1052060	I got a straight 30 on a 70.
1052060	1054540	You beat him.
1054540	1061660	He fires and you see a little dart goes right into the headrest of the middle seat right
1061660	1062940	next to you.
1062940	1064500	And it is your turn to act.
1064500	1067340	I want to wrestle the gun away from his hand.
1067340	1070340	And as I'm doing so saying, what the fuck, Leon, what the fuck?
1070380	1074020	All right, let's roll an unarmed combat check.
1077020	1078020	I fail.
1078020	1079020	I failed too.
1079020	1080020	I got a 91.
1080020	1081020	I got a 94.
1081020	1083260	So that's just fail on fail.
1083260	1087220	So he continues driving without a wrecking.
1087220	1093160	However, the gun is just like being wildly moved back and forth and you've got two hands
1093160	1097380	on his arm and he is trying to muscle back on you.
1097380	1098860	It's his turn.
1098860	1102180	And he is going to try to wrestle the gun away from you.
1102180	1104180	So roll it up again, baby.
1104180	1107300	I got a five.
1107300	1110780	I crit on different dice.
1110780	1111900	These are different dice.
1111900	1113460	I don't think I've ever used these either.
1113460	1114460	It's a 33.
1114460	1115460	Okay.
1115460	1116460	You have full control over the situation.
1116460	1117460	What do you do?
1117460	1121540	I rip the gun out of his hand and I pointed at the back of his head.
1121540	1122540	Leon.
1122540	1123540	Yeah.
1123540	1124540	What the fuck?
1124540	1127780	I just thought it'd be easier if you weren't conscious for this next part.
1127780	1128780	Please don't.
1128780	1130260	Did you want me unconscious?
1130260	1131260	Yeah.
1131260	1133620	There's a star.
1133620	1134940	Is he still driving while we're talking?
1134940	1136260	He is still driving while you're talking.
1136260	1137520	Can I tell where he's going?
1137520	1138580	Has he left campus?
1138580	1139580	He hasn't.
1139580	1141160	No, it's a, it's a pretty big campus.
1141160	1145580	So he's just like driving slowly through these stop signs and stuff.
1145580	1148980	I was just doing that for the best.
1148980	1155440	So, okay, so you are, you are essentially, I know this sucks, but I've got a lot riding
1155440	1160360	on you in the future and I thought it would be safest if you weren't around for this next
1160360	1165920	little bit because what if we run into issues like the whole time we were running through
1165920	1172400	the bar court place, I was horrified that a stray bullet or something ends all of this.
1172400	1177000	And if you die, maybe the world ends like I don't know, but I need to protect you at
1177000	1178000	all costs.
1178000	1183200	But Leon, if you're saying that the overseer started the circle and I am the overseer,
1183200	1184400	that means I live through all this.
1184400	1185400	I'm untouchable.
1185400	1188120	The, I don't know if the future and the past work.
1188120	1189960	I don't know how any of this works.
1189960	1198160	Roll a human for me, I fail a 42 on a 30.
1198160	1199160	I just don't know.
1199160	1200160	I don't know.
1200160	1202320	I don't know how any of this works and I have to keep you safe.
1202320	1203320	Listen to me, Leon.
1203320	1207160	I've started to think that maybe this overseer business sounds pretty good to me.
1207160	1211660	And if you're saying that I have bulletproof armor, cause I start the circle, I'm not saying
1211660	1215360	that you are saying that I start the circle in the past.
1215360	1217080	So I think I'm going to be dandy.
1217080	1218720	I think I'm going to get out of this unscathed.
1218720	1221720	You on the other hand, might want to keep your head down, cause I don't remember Leon
1221720	1224280	being Clark Old's right hand man.
1224280	1230280	Hey, Leon, from here on out, I'm on your side, but I want involved.
1230280	1232680	You don't get to knock me out and sideline me like that.
1232680	1234160	Okay, that's fair.
1234160	1235720	Oh, Clark.
1235720	1238920	We, uh, we gotta go to the camp.
1238920	1239920	It's time.
1239920	1240920	The camp?
1240920	1241920	Yeah, we gotta go to...
1241920	1244360	Joe's gonna say, is it the calm, comfy campground?
1244360	1246480	We gotta go to the calm, comfy campground.
1246480	1247480	Yeah, boy.
1247480	1250240	Aren't you proud of me?
1250240	1251360	I'm super proud of you.
1251360	1253660	Zach, I remember that without even looking at notes.
1253660	1255320	You get 10 luck.
1255320	1260660	Yeah, that's what I was fishing for.
1260660	1265640	But first, do you actually, let's go back to what you just said a few moments ago.
1265640	1270720	Do you actually believe that you're like indestructible?
1270720	1272120	It's all I've been presented with so far.
1272120	1273440	Yeah, I think so.
1273440	1279520	How competent do you feel with these other two solving this situation here at CSU?
1279520	1286280	I mean, key's always a big question mark in my life, but maybe working together they can
1286280	1287280	figure something out.
1287280	1288480	I don't know.
1288480	1289480	You know what?
1289480	1290480	Let's...
1290480	1298800	I am curious, Clark, and he turns the car back and heads up to...
1298800	1302480	You actually see a sign on the building that you're heading directly towards and it's the
1302480	1307520	administrative building, which is where you guys were originally planning on going.
1307520	1310520	It's where he said you guys were originally planning on going.
1310520	1312720	Before he tried to kidnap me.
1312720	1313720	Uh-huh!
1313720	1314720	Yeah!
1314720	1321520	Before that happened, he's like, no hard feelings on that, by the way, I just, you know, I'm
1321520	1324080	doing my job and I...
1324080	1330920	But honestly, if you can prove what's happening here, I mean, I would be, I'll help, I'm interested.
1330920	1332000	Let's just do this.
1332040	1333520	Let's fucking go for it.
1333520	1337560	And he pulls up to the spot right next to the door and...
1337560	1341440	So you're saying we're not gonna go to the comfy campgrounds then?
1341440	1342880	No, we absolutely will.
1342880	1345660	We'll just take care of this first, because I want to see if you can.
1345660	1351240	If you can, then I, you know, that'll be just incredible.
1351240	1352240	And then we can head over there.
1352240	1354160	It's not time sensitive then.
1354160	1358560	It is, but I have a feeling that we've already got a timer on this situation.
1358560	1360920	All right, Leon, I'll follow your lead.
1360920	1361920	I like that.
1361920	1362920	How does he get out?
1362920	1367440	Yeah, and I think you might be, he relinquished the gun to you.
1367440	1368920	Well, I definitely didn't give it back.
1368920	1369920	Yeah.
1369920	1370920	He hasn't asked for it, you mean?
1370920	1371920	No, he hasn't asked for it.
1371920	1372920	Yeah.
1372920	1373920	Okay.
1373920	1374920	Yeah, I'm gonna just hold on to it.
1374920	1397360	John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna get out of the car that Clark Bishop and Leon Simpson
1397360	1398360	were in.
1398360	1403920	And you guys look out at the campus of CSU, City State University, and the entire thing
1403920	1407160	is riddled with holiday spirit.
1407160	1411880	There are decorations covering everything.
1411880	1413760	Like say a holiday decoration.
1413760	1414760	Wreath.
1414760	1419480	Yeah, there's a big wreath that's just like on the dorm building right in front of you.
1419480	1420480	Lights.
1420480	1421480	Oh yeah.
1421480	1422480	Oh, you know there's lights.
1422480	1424520	There's like an absurd amount of Christmas lights.
1424520	1429760	They're on every single building up the walls and on every tree on campus as well.
1429760	1431640	It's actually, it's quite pretty.
1431640	1432640	Inflatable minion.
1432960	1434320	There's an inflatable minion.
1434320	1436160	It's a wave.
1436160	1441540	It's Derek and it's wearing the Christmas hat.
1441540	1442540	What is that called?
1442540	1443540	Santa hat?
1443540	1444540	Santa hat.
1444540	1446660	It's wearing a Christmas hat.
1446660	1451240	And yeah, it's arms are just like the only thing that's moving on it.
1451240	1455000	What is the mascot of City State University?
1455000	1458240	The mascot of City State University.
1458240	1460760	Yeah, that was the question he asked.
1461680	1466360	What was the mascot of City State University?
1466360	1467880	I'm assuming you have this written down.
1467880	1468880	Just control F mascot.
1468880	1474160	Oh yeah, let me just look it up on my computer real quick.
1474160	1475880	It is a Venus fly trap.
1475880	1476880	Cool.
1476880	1477880	That's a native to North Carolina.
1477880	1479900	Well, you don't know where we are.
1479900	1481360	Not North Carolina though, right?
1481360	1484240	Probably not, but it's native to the city.
1484240	1487800	Tigers aren't from Detroit, so.
1487800	1489960	Tigers are not from Detroit, Thomas.
1489960	1492640	I know at least three tigers that are.
1492640	1496280	Anyway, wow, this place is Christmassed out.
1496280	1498080	This is a good podcast, guys.
1498080	1499080	Are there trees?
1499080	1506520	Okay, so you get past the Christmas decorations and you have been given directions to go to
1506520	1513680	the dorm room of Harriet Marks, which is 328 Giff's house.
1513680	1517080	And actually you see this building that is right in front of you.
1517080	1524760	It has a sign on it that in big capital letters it says Giff's house, G-I-F-F-S.
1524760	1530800	And the building is covered in a massive wreath that is lousy with lights.
1530800	1533480	Let's go in there up to the third floor, I'm assuming.
1533480	1534480	Room 328.
1534480	1540480	When you guys go into Giff's house, you see that all the lights are out.
1540480	1545160	Hey real quick, do you know how I already knew how that was spelled before you told
1545160	1546160	us?
1546240	1550560	If it had only had one F, you would have said it wrong.
1550560	1551560	That's an opinion.
1551560	1557840	So you guys were going into Giff's house and the lights are out.
1557840	1562960	On your right there is a secretary's desk and there's a computer.
1562960	1567360	The glow of the computer screen is the only light in this room, but you can make out from
1567360	1572400	there that to your left there's like a sitting area with a baby grand piano and ahead of
1572400	1579120	you there is a glass wall of windows with a door leading into that room and then from
1579120	1582320	there there's a hallway that breaks off and it goes left and right.
1582320	1584160	Baby grand piano is my pop star name.
1584160	1586920	Ooh, that's really good.
1586920	1588920	Yeah it is.
1588920	1589920	Is the secretary there?
1589920	1593040	No, there's no one in this room at all.
1593040	1600080	Is there a fire escape plan on the wall to see if we can locate 321 or 328 without?
1600080	1604120	Yeah absolutely, so you've got stairwells on either side of the building and an elevator
1604120	1605120	in the middle.
1605120	1607520	I'd like to see if I can access this computer.
1607520	1608520	Sure.
1608520	1609520	Yeah, you can hop on there.
1609520	1610520	Any good stuff?
1610520	1614840	Oh, there's a directory you can find out that when you look up Harriet Marks, she lives
1614840	1615840	in 328.
1615840	1622560	Her roommate's name is Amelia Locke and right across the hall is 330 Giff's house, which
1622560	1625260	is listed as show dorm.
1625260	1630000	Like one they show to prospective students on tours, yes.
1630000	1633760	Let's go up there and see if we can find anything, probably need to talk to Amelia
1633760	1634760	too.
1634760	1641720	Or sidebar, we change our clothes, we go crash in that show dorm until somebody realizes
1641720	1647920	what's up and we just do a whole spin-off where Keith and John Lee Pettymore go to college.
1647920	1649520	You know what, I like that idea.
1649520	1650520	Spin-off!
1650520	1655320	I certainly never went to college unless it says otherwise on my character sheet.
1655320	1656560	No, I went to...
1656560	1659720	Oh no, I went here.
1659720	1661560	Does it remind you of the good old days?
1661560	1662800	It does, I want to go back.
1662800	1665720	Well, I think we should get this investigation out of the way first.
1665720	1669280	Actually, I have written down City University, which I imagine is City State University's
1669280	1670280	intense crosstown rival.
1670280	1671280	It absolutely is.
1671280	1672280	Yeah, it's their big rival.
1672280	1674440	No, I hate fucking CSU scum.
1674440	1676440	Yeah, you're a poinsettia.
1676440	1677440	Yeah!
1677440	1680440	Well, I always wanted to come here because...
1680440	1681440	Point!
1681440	1682440	Poinsettia!
1682440	1683440	City University leads the way!
1683440	1684440	Nice!
1684440	1685440	That's our fight song.
1685440	1688520	I walk to where the elevator is.
1688520	1695080	And the elevator door opens as the light emits from the elevator into the hallway that
1695080	1696080	you're in.
1696080	1699980	And you can also see it from the light on the vending machines behind you.
1699980	1706200	The walls and the floor of this space are completely covered in numbers, like absolutely
1706200	1707420	riddled in numbers.
1707420	1712300	So many different sequences of numbers, in fact, that you can't make out any specific
1712300	1713300	single sequence.
1713300	1714680	What are they written with?
1714680	1716040	All sorts of materials.
1716040	1724200	We've got Sharpie, paint, spray paint, blood, cum, piss, like there seems to be a smear
1724200	1725640	of shit on the wall at some point.
1725640	1727160	Tell me more about the cum numbers.
1727160	1734120	So the cum numbers, they're dripping, and they were dripping, now they're coagulated
1734120	1735160	in place.
1735160	1737680	Is there a dorm room near us?
1737680	1738680	Just any dorm room?
1738680	1739680	There's actually not, no.
1739680	1743120	Well, damn, do you think people are still living in this dorm room, or in this dorm
1743120	1744120	hall?
1744120	1745120	I have no idea.
1745200	1749040	I'm not able to clean this, literally this shit up, but I don't know.
1749040	1750600	What dorm room are we in her dorm room?
1750600	1756120	No, you were about to get into the elevator from the main floor up to the third floor,
1756120	1762140	but you do see that when you turn to look into the elevator, in the corner that would
1762140	1769040	be out of sight when the elevator door first opened, there is a slumped over body of a
1769040	1770040	student.
1770040	1774600	And the head has been smashed.
1774600	1782360	Her face is no longer a face, it seems to have been hit repeatedly in the forehead and
1782360	1783360	nose.
1783360	1785120	What the fuck kind of hell dorm is this?
1785120	1786600	I don't know, but uh.
1786600	1789320	If John Lee Pettymark could roll a sanity check for me.
1789320	1792200	Yeah, John, you probably shouldn't be looking at that.
1792200	1793200	Fail.
1793200	1795520	Go ahead and lose one sanity.
1795520	1796520	We're getting there.
1796520	1801520	I go over and turn the body over, look for like a, is there a purse on this person?
1801520	1804880	Do you see that there is a fanny pack on this person?
1804880	1807480	I'm gonna dig through and find identification.
1807480	1811120	Yeah, her name was Samantha Carter.
1811120	1812120	Poor Samantha.
1812120	1815600	Well, good thing it wasn't Amelia, because that's who I'm wanting to talk to.
1815600	1818320	And I hit the third floor button in the elevator.
1818320	1820920	Alright, and Thomas, if you could leave the room.
1820920	1822920	Before we do that, can you tell me what I found on the computer?
1822920	1827360	It was just the info for like who lived where.
1827360	1828760	Did you want to find anything else?
1828760	1830320	Yeah, like the answer to all these mysteries.
1830320	1834040	Oh yeah, the answer to all the mysteries isn't on there, unfortunately.
1834040	1835040	But there was a...
1835040	1836040	Wrong computer.
1836040	1837040	Is there a reason I'm not going with him?
1837040	1842560	There was a big, like, when you first got on the computer, the background for the entire
1842560	1849560	thing was a promotional ad, like a poster, for The Jingle Ball, taking place the night
1849560	1852640	of December 6th at CSU.
1852640	1858400	And it says, follow the scavenger hunt to make your way to The Jingle Ball.
1858400	1860580	Is December 6th the night that...
1860580	1861580	That's the night.
1861580	1862580	Okay.
1862580	1864120	And do we know what date Harriet died?
1864120	1865120	December 2nd.
1865120	1866120	Okay.
1866120	1868880	So is there a reason I'm not going up the elevator with him?
1868880	1869880	Yes.
1869880	1870880	Okay.
1870880	1871880	I mean, we would have gone up together, right?
1871880	1872880	Yep.
1872880	1873880	Okay.
1873880	1883760	Hey, Leon?
1883760	1887200	Yeah.
1887200	1892160	Got your gun here.
1892160	1893160	Yeah, I know.
1893160	1895760	Is this these, those mind control darts?
1895760	1901040	He looks at you with like a grimace, like he's about to burp, like I just did.
1901040	1902040	No.
1902040	1906080	What would they have done to me?
1906080	1908200	Probably fall asleep for a while.
1908200	1909500	How long's a while?
1909500	1910500	Not too long.
1910500	1911500	I'm going to hold on to it then.
1911500	1914680	I don't want you sneaking up behind me and doing it, trying to do it again.
1914680	1916160	That seems fair.
1916160	1918840	And I don't want to do that to you now.
1918840	1925220	I mean, if you're willing to, you seem down for the cause and with your current knowledge,
1925220	1926720	I think that we're good.
1926720	1927720	All right.
1927720	1930040	Let's find out what we can about the...
1930040	1931040	It was Harriet Marks.
1931040	1932800	That's what we were looking for, right?
1932800	1933800	Harriet Marks.
1933800	1935120	Let's see what we can find out.
1935120	1941760	And you guys open up the door and now I want to paint a picture for you, Joe.
1941760	1944720	When you're walking on this campus, it's fucking dead.
1944720	1946200	Like it's evening.
1946200	1951920	The sun is going down currently, but there is no one on this campus.
1951920	1958180	It's just kind of, it's Saturday, you know, but it's still a college campus and there
1958180	1963220	are holiday themed decorations obliterating this place.
1963220	1970340	It's almost as if someone like vomited delicious holiday spirit all over for a block square
1970340	1972260	of the city.
1972260	1976180	It's filthy with holiday stuff.
1976180	1977260	Just dirty with it.
1977260	1978340	It's dirty with it.
1978340	1981300	It's lousy with Christmas gear.
1981300	1988860	It's like tiny Santa clauses everywhere and menorah, like blow up menorah, just like in
1988860	1991240	a yard in front of one of the dorms.
1991240	1992820	It's all over the place.
1992820	1993820	It's great.
1993820	1994820	If you love Christmas...
1994820	1996180	How does Clark feel about Christmas?
1996180	1997780	Does he have good memories?
1997780	1998980	Oh shit.
1998980	2000140	That's a good question.
2000140	2005860	He probably has early good memories right up until his old parents didn't have Christmas
2005860	2006980	for him no more.
2006980	2010580	No more Christmas for old Clark Bishop, or young Clark Bishop.
2010580	2012700	A young Clark Bishop still had no Christmas.
2012700	2014020	Old young Clark Bishop.
2014020	2016420	I think you nailed it.
2016420	2020420	The technical name of your character at this point in the show.
2020420	2026620	So when you guys walk in, the administration office is actually open, but inside all the
2026620	2030500	lights are off and there's seemingly no one in here.
2030500	2032340	Do we know what time of day it is right now?
2032340	2034020	The sun is going down.
2034020	2035460	It's about golden hour.
2035460	2037820	It's yay around golden hour.
2037820	2039060	Cool.
2039060	2040060	Take a picture.
2040580	2041580	It looks beautiful.
2041580	2042580	Yeah, you and...
2042580	2043580	It must be.
2043580	2046220	You and Leon could take a great selfie right now.
2046220	2048420	Leon, Leon, hang on a sec.
2048420	2049420	Yeah.
2049420	2050740	Gotta take a picture with you.
2050740	2053380	Well, it's golden hour.
2053380	2056780	We look great in front of all this Christmas stuff.
2056780	2062740	Okay, so we're gonna go into where they have all the files.
2062740	2063740	I don't know.
2063740	2065340	I don't know how colleges work.
2065340	2067300	And so let's just hop in there and see what happens.
2067420	2075900	So you guys turn a corner in this unlit corridor and about halfway down the hallway, you see
2075900	2082820	two figures and one of them, you just hear this like voice that is repeatedly just going
2082820	2083820	like, please.
2083820	2090420	Oh gosh, I would love to four if you just mumble some other words and is like letters
2090420	2094460	and stuff and numbers and is like, please just hit me, hit me, hit me.
2094460	2095460	Oh God.
2095500	2097300	I'll have to do it to myself.
2097300	2099460	He's talking to another figure that I can't see either.
2099460	2105340	Yeah, and the other figure is just staring, just like standing there, not really moving.
2105340	2108980	I nudge Leon, they're saying numbers.
2108980	2109980	Is it the number stuff?
2109980	2110980	I don't know.
2110980	2111980	What do you want to do?
2111980	2112980	Are they totally in our way?
2112980	2118300	Well, and then you guys look over and there's a sign and it says like office and there's
2118300	2120560	an arrow pointing directly toward them.
2120560	2122540	We're both still wearing police uniforms, aren't we?
2122540	2123540	Yeah.
2123540	2124540	Sure, we'll approach them.
2124620	2126140	We'll find the records office, right?
2126140	2127140	Yeah, yeah.
2127140	2128140	Perfect.
2128140	2130140	I'll go get Justin from the other room.
2148140	2154500	Luke, as Keith Vigna and John Lee Pettymore stand in the elevator, the elevator door closes
2154860	2162220	and John Lee Pettymore pulls a Sharpie out and begins writing a sequence of numbers.
2162220	2164200	I just watch him and see what they are.
2164200	2169500	On the elevator wall and it is the numbers that you have seen him write and heard him
2169500	2170500	chant.
2170500	2171500	Right.
2171500	2172500	Bruce Robin.
2172500	2173500	Bruce Robin.
2173500	2176360	The elevator door opens and you are on the third floor.
2176360	2182140	It is also completely dark, the lights are all out and it is silent.
2182140	2184900	I get my phone out to light the hallway.
2184900	2188780	I guess I'll grab John and kind of just drag him behind me.
2188780	2194040	Yeah, and when he can't write anymore he just starts murmuring those numbers over and over.
2194040	2197220	Can I just like kind of slap him a little bit to see if he pops out of it?
2197220	2198220	He does not.
2198220	2203420	Okay, I'm looking for 328 on the placards on the walls and I'm leading John behind me.
2203420	2208460	Yeah, you make it down there and you're at 328 Giff's house.
2208460	2209460	Is it unlocked?
2209460	2210460	It is.
2210460	2216740	It is actually wide open as is the door across the hall, 330, which John told you was the
2216740	2217740	show dorm.
2217740	2221260	Before I go into 328 I'm going to look into 330, what does it look like?
2221260	2226740	It looks like a very well presented dorm room for a college freshman.
2226740	2230260	There's lots of, what did I say the mascot was?
2230260	2231260	Venus Flytrap.
2231260	2238220	There's lots of Venus Flytrap apparel and paraphernalia all throughout this city state
2238220	2240740	dorm room with their logo all over.
2240740	2246580	And in the middle of the room there is one out of place Casio keyboard with a sheet of
2246580	2247700	music in front of it.
2247700	2250340	I'll pull John in behind me and shut the door.
2250340	2251340	Okay.
2251340	2252740	That way he doesn't escape somehow.
2252740	2254220	Are there numbers on the walls?
2254220	2255740	There are, yes.
2255740	2259420	There are numbers covering the walls, the floor, the ceiling, and literally like a desk.
2259420	2261300	Was that also in the hallway and stuff?
2261300	2263340	Yes, every single place that you've been so far.
2263340	2265900	Okay, I'm going to go and see what the music is.
2265940	2270780	A set of music notes written on the staff is pictures.
2270780	2277300	And the pictures are seven eggs, a golf ball, a cat, a demon, and an egg.
2277300	2279380	Are they like cartoons or?
2279380	2280380	They are.
2280380	2287940	And John Lee Pettymore begins writing once again on the back of the chair in this room.
2287940	2290220	Bruce Robin in numbers.
2290220	2291220	Is the keyboard on?
2291220	2292220	It is.
2292220	2295260	If I press on some keys is it just, what kind of sounds are they making?
2295700	2296900	Oh no, it's jingle bells.
2296900	2300700	It's like a, it's like ching, but it's a, I gotta, it's like cling.
2300700	2301980	How do, how do bells sound?
2301980	2305260	Like jingle bells are like chink, chink, chink, chink, chink, chink, chink, chink, chink.
2305260	2306880	So it's a, it's a shunk.
2306880	2309740	It's a shunk, but in a specific tone.
2309740	2310740	So poke around.
2310740	2313340	It's not like fart noises and like bleh, bleh, bleh.
2313340	2314340	No, no.
2314340	2317380	It's more like the, you know how they have like the choirs on there.
2317380	2319660	They're like lah, lah, lah.
2319660	2324940	I guess I'm going to take this sheet and put it in my pocket because I don't know what
2324940	2325940	it means right now.
2325940	2326940	Sure.
2326940	2330340	I guess I'll take one more look around and then I guess go over to 328.
2330340	2331340	Okay.
2331340	2335100	So looking around, the only thing that you would notice is like there's a window in this
2335100	2341740	dorm room and looking out you can see the whole campus from here and it too is completely,
2341740	2344540	the whole campus is all festive.
2344540	2346820	Like there are lights up everywhere.
2346820	2350780	There's all these different decorations all over the place and in the middle of campus
2350780	2352860	there's a large old bell tower.
2352860	2355020	Is there a sheet for the dance in here?
2355020	2356020	The ball?
2356020	2357020	Like a flyer?
2357020	2358020	Yes.
2358020	2359020	Yeah.
2359020	2360020	There are multiple flyers.
2360020	2363180	Can I grab one and see like what is the like first clue or whatever on it?
2363180	2366380	Actually on the back of one of them, they're written in Sharpie.
2366380	2374460	It says one plus three plus nine plus and then it like has a bunch of math and then
2374460	2379420	it says equals three 30 which you would know is the room number that you're standing in.
2379420	2381460	What else does the like flyer say?
2381460	2385260	The flyer just says it's got a bunch of like pictures.
2385260	2390820	It's a lot of like illustration and design and then it says the annual jingle ball.
2390820	2397540	Follow the scavenger hunt in order to make your way to the night of your holiday season.
2397540	2401980	If I look around, is there anything that like looks like a scavenger hunt list or anything?
2401980	2402980	Nope.
2402980	2403980	Okay.
2403980	2405200	I'm going to go head over to 328 then.
2405200	2406200	In 328?
2406200	2407200	With John and Toe.
2407200	2408200	Yeah, John's with you.
2408200	2410620	He's still doing the same dumb shit.
2411020	2414860	In 328 you would see, it's a similar scene.
2414860	2421260	There's shit written all over the place in all sorts of different materials and what
2421260	2426580	you already learned about Harriet Marks is that she is a pro-union activist.
2426580	2433820	There are pictures of her with different groups and different protests and marches and then
2434020	2442020	her roommate, you find out her name, Amelia Locke, and she has pictures of her with different
2442020	2447740	trophies and then you see actually she has all of her trophies displayed and they are
2447740	2456720	for riddle competitions and scavenger hunt competitions and there is a space on her desk
2456720	2459300	where a laptop would be.
2459300	2464380	Like you see where her connecting cable, like her power cord would normally plug in.
2464380	2471740	She's got the cord ready to plug in with one of those little DIY tricks with the binder clips.
2471740	2474300	Right, right.
2474300	2479860	And then you see like on the other side, the USB for her old school USB mouse is like clipped
2479860	2484420	in on the other side for the USB port on the opposite side of this laptop that is not there.
2484420	2488420	If I look around the room, is there any, can I find like a phone number or anything for
2489020	2492140	Roll search for me.
2492140	2493140	Eight on a forty.
2493140	2497500	Uh, yes, you find phone numbers for both Harriet Marks and Amelia Clarke.
2497500	2498500	Okay, I'm gonna...
2498500	2499500	Sorry.
2499500	2500500	Amelia Locke.
2500500	2501500	Right, not Amelia Earhart.
2501500	2502500	Correct.
2502500	2505700	Uh, I'll write those down and I'm gonna give Amelia a call.
2505700	2506700	Okay.
2506700	2507700	Bring bring!
2507700	2508700	And...
2508700	2509700	Bring bring!
2509700	2510700	That was Taylor.
2510700	2511700	Thank you everyone.
2511700	2512700	And it goes to voicemail.
2512700	2514260	Voicemail box is not set up.
2514260	2515900	Okay, put my phone away.
2515900	2517540	What were all the trophies for?
2517660	2520860	Oh, yeah, Brittle Competitions and Scavenger Hunt Competitions.
2520860	2528340	With your correct search role, you actually find a handwritten note in the desk of Amelia
2528340	2533860	Clarke, where she is talking about Amelia Locke, right?
2533860	2534860	God damn it.
2534860	2537240	What did I say that time, Clarke?
2537240	2538700	Who is Amelia Clarke Bishop?
2538700	2540140	I don't know.
2540140	2548820	So Amelia Locke has a handwritten note in her desk where she is freehand writing her
2548820	2555840	views on the suicide of her roommate, Harriet Marks.
2555840	2564300	And basically nothing concrete, but she was very confused by the way it all went down.
2564340	2569980	I did not think that Harriet was the type of person who would commit suicide and said
2569980	2574740	that she had a plan to figure out what actually happened.
2574740	2576020	Okay, interesting.
2576020	2577500	Was it just on a scrap piece of paper?
2577500	2578500	It was, yeah.
2578500	2581780	Is there anything else in the desk that looks of interest?
2581780	2582780	Dildo.
2582780	2584700	I closed the desk.
2584700	2586980	Kind of red-faced.
2586980	2591180	Glad that Jon is kind of in that state so that I'm not more embarrassed than I would
2591180	2592180	be.
2592180	2595700	Is that like where Harriet's stuff was?
2595700	2597700	Can I search around her desk and stuff?
2597700	2598700	Absolutely.
2598700	2601180	Go ahead and roll another search check for me.
2601180	2603660	31 on a 40.
2603660	2609600	Written on a sticky note and tucked away in between other papers, you find something that
2609600	2611120	catches your eye.
2611120	2616460	You find a sticky note that has a to-do list written on it.
2616460	2624700	And the first thing says, research most unethical corporation in the city.
2624700	2630700	And the second mark on the to-do list says, who is the overseer?
2646460	2676300	How am I the only one trying to pull over How can I have enough drowning out of the
2677140	2678140	house?
2678140	2679140	No one knows.
2679140	2680140	There's no one home.
2680140	2681140	No one home.
2681140	2681140
