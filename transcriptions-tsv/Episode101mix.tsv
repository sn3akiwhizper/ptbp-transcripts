0	3200	What is happening my students?
3200	7300	It's your professor of wolf studies, Wolf, the dog.
7300	10520	And I'm here to lecture you about the various bones
10520	12780	that wolves like me possess.
12780	15720	How much cream is in the body?
15720	19080	How much grease the fur retains?
19080	21360	You know, college stuff.
21360	26360	And I am teaching it you live from 694.2 PTBP,
26560	30320	the only radio show that delves into factual things
30320	34080	regarding wolf the dog biology, my babies.
34080	37760	Speaking of knowledge, we got a new Howlin' with Wolf.
37760	40960	This episode's Howlin' with Wolf was sent by Derek
40960	45040	from the RGV, the Rio Grande Valley.
45040	47380	They write, howdy y'all.
47380	49320	Big shout out from South Texas
49320	52940	to all the PTBP peeps near and far.
52940	56000	Can't wait to get back to the boys in contention.
56520	58920	And finally get to the bottom of this mystery.
58920	62320	Don't get me wrong, all this timey wimey stuff
62320	66100	is fun and all, but boy howdy does it give me a headache.
66100	69440	If only there was a handy dandy recap
69440	74240	that retold these events in a succinct but thorough fashion.
74240	76660	Anyways, stay safe out there.
76660	79120	Lots of love to the PTBP crew
79120	83080	and a big eye woo to wolf the dog.
83080	86860	Thanks for writing in Derek from the Rio Grande Valley.
86860	90040	I hope one day to visit this mystical Texas
90040	91920	that I've heard so much about.
91920	95320	It sounds like a place that a wolf really could lay down
95320	98560	a garbage nest to lay many eggs in.
98560	101240	Anyway, if you wanna write up a little something
101240	103780	for your wolfy wolfy to howl howl,
103780	106560	tag us on the internet at PretendingPod
106560	109840	or write a five star review on Apple Podcasts.
109840	114520	And send us a screenshot at pretendedpod at gmail.com.
114520	117360	And if you want 23 bonus episodes,
117360	120520	become a citizen of contention for $5 a month
120520	124280	over on patreon.com slash pretending pod.
124280	126620	The link is in the show notes.
126620	129040	There's a recording of the session zero
129040	132680	for building contention and brainstorming PC ideas.
132680	134200	There's some Q and A's,
134200	136980	there's some really silly one shots
136980	141660	and 10 of the episodes tied together in an ongoing story
141660	144200	that has featured 11 different agents
144200	149200	due to the brutal approach Zach has leaned
149200	153500	into this more delta greenie, delta green campaign.
153500	155420	All of which is homebrew except
155420	159100	for the wonderfully disgusting scenario lover in the ice.
159100	161960	But I'll stop peddling so y'all don't snooze.
161960	165340	You know where I'm heading, it's time for the news.
165340	168700	Last time, our three leading men came to
168700	173340	in the darkness of Ari Manstein's mausoleum again.
173340	176720	That's number four, if I remember correctly.
176720	180740	And every single name on their bodies has been crossed out.
180740	183780	After Keith revealed he went back in time,
183780	187220	became Silas Cole and invented ball.
187220	189040	Well, John got real angsty
189040	191740	and poured out some pent up daddy issues
191740	194780	while in his dad's body.
195060	197780	The trio called an Uber and headed off to contention
197780	202780	to nab the book on the way to calm comfy campgrounds
202860	205120	to confront Maggie Cook.
205120	208660	But the driver Spud in his vintage Volkswagen van
208660	211140	couldn't evade the goo-nami
211140	215020	that first consumed the bodies of Councilwoman Carrie Pages
215020	218620	and Salem the cat atop a familiar four wheeler
218620	220860	with an odd radio on the back
220860	222460	before it eventually swallowed
222460	225460	our narratively central characters as well.
226340	230540	Same fucking shit got me too, goddamn goo.
230540	234340	And now I can't see my pa in front of my ma,
234340	237060	but I can hear, oh, I can hear.
237060	239940	Be eternally grateful that you can too,
239940	243340	if only for the privilege of blessing your body
243340	245760	and the space between your functional ears
245760	249360	with this impossible to over-hype song.
249400	253040	And if I'm not right, then it's best to be wrong.
253040	257480	It's Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Living In?
257480	263480	["What Kind of World Are You Living In?" by Dragon in 3 plays in the background.]
263480	267600	Bad girls on top of the water
267600	271800	Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline
271800	275800	Leaving my mind at your altar
275800	277960	Crossing the double line
277960	279480	Doing it every time
279480	285480	Tell me what kind of world are you living in
288280	293280	What kind of world are you living in
297120	300920	So I've realized we kind of have a finite number of episodes left
300920	304200	before we start on like a new story
304200	307360	and people might be like listening to it for the first time.
307360	311600	We only have so many intros where people have already listened
311600	313480	to like a hundred episodes of this probably
313480	314480	if they're listening to this.
314480	318520	So we can say some pretty messed up stuff
318520	319880	and they'll keep listening.
319880	321240	So I looked up on Quora
321240	325080	what are the most inappropriate questions to ask people.
325080	327780	So Joe, are you pregnant?
327780	328840	Yes.
328840	332080	Luke, are you wearing a wig?
332080	332920	Yes.
333920	339160	And Thomas, were you in jail because you murdered someone?
339160	342920	Some ones, but yes.
342920	344080	Someone's what?
344080	345720	Some's one.
345720	347200	I have a legitimate question though.
347200	348120	Put it on Quora.
348120	353920	Will it feel like if I put orchids in my bong and smoke it?
353920	357960	Why on earth would I do that?
357960	358840	Here's the deal.
358920	360560	I have over 500 orchids
360560	362760	and not one of them will get anyone high.
365040	368280	So the other day you posted a thing on Instagram.
368280	370640	You were like my favorite corner of the house.
370640	371920	Yeah.
371920	374360	You just kind of didn't mention that they were all
374360	376400	it was a picture of plants, but they're all mine.
376400	378040	Wow.
378040	379540	That's stolen valor.
379540	380380	I did not.
380380	385380	That's stolen valor and I'd like an apology.
386380	390380	I'm not going to apologize because nowhere in that post
390380	392340	did I say that they were mine.
392340	396140	They exist in my house and what I posted was
396140	399900	this is the best corner of the living room, which is true.
399900	402660	I did not say these are mine.
402660	404700	So I'm not apologizing.
404700	408020	Plant emoji and then a colon and then tag.
408020	409260	Not going to happen.
409260	412100	I'm going to comment on there right now.
412100	413380	These are all mine.
416380	418380	Thomas, how many plants do you have now?
418380	421380	He has over 500 orchids and they're not going to get anyone high.
421380	424380	I have over 500 orchids.
424380	429380	No, I do have like 20 orchids and a bunch of other plants.
430380	433380	Were you in jail because you murdered someone?
433380	435380	Some's one, but yes.
435380	436380	Adam's cane.
436380	439380	The orchids bring me peace.
439380	444380	I have like 10 full size orchids and then 10 of those are real tiny.
444380	446380	They're little mini orchids.
446380	449380	It's not like I'm crazy.
449380	453380	They're actually all mine is the thing.
453380	454380	That's the deal.
454380	455380	That's the deal.
455380	456380	I got some orchids.
456380	457380	You got some orchids.
457380	458380	I got some orchids.
458380	459380	I got some orchids.
459380	460380	I got some orchids.
460380	461380	I got some orchids.
461380	462380	Oh, you got some?
462380	463380	I got some orchids, but I got some orchids.
463380	464380	You got some orchids.
464380	465380	That's the deal.
465380	466380	That's the other deal.
466380	467380	Luke takes care of them all.
467380	470380	Yeah, I do all the work.
470380	472380	Luke, I watered your orchids yesterday.
472380	474380	Thank you.
474380	475380	You're welcome.
475380	477380	Luke does have two orchids.
477380	482380	I sprayed the orchids the other day and I watered my little palm tree.
482380	484380	That's what he calls his penis.
484380	489380	I was in jail because I put my orchids in a bong and smoked it.
489380	493380	Should we start the episode or should we talk about cat suck house?
493380	500380	You begin falling upward through a technicolor swirl composed of unnatural hues your eyes
500380	505380	cannot quite comprehend while at the same time completely dark.
505380	511380	The nothingness is endless and you feel content physically.
511380	518380	It's a familiar feeling, one you felt upon each of your resets in Ari Manstein's Mausoleum
518380	526380	and above you in the direction you're weightlessly falling is nothing but the complete absence of light.
526380	534380	Somehow both a maelstrom of overstimulation and a wholly empty void.
534380	536380	Do we have our faculties about us?
536380	538380	Seemingly.
538380	541380	Completely warped, completely confused.
541380	547380	You see that John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth has rolled himself up into a ball
547380	550380	and he is floating up alongside with you as is.
550380	551380	Do they see that?
551380	552380	Are you rolled up like a ball?
552380	554380	I thought we couldn't see anything.
554380	556380	Oh you can't but you can clearly see each other.
556380	557380	That's a thing.
557380	563380	You can't see anything but you are all seeing each other as well as this weird light around you
563380	570380	that is the most colorful thing you've ever seen, hues you've never experienced and it's also completely pitch dark.
570380	572380	Cool. Cool.
572380	573380	And you're all there.
573380	574380	And you're falling upward.
574380	575380	Endlessly.
575380	578380	And who else is there but Spud?
578380	581380	I had no shit, went to middle school with a kid named Spud.
581380	582380	Really?
582380	583380	Yeah.
583380	584380	Oh.
584380	590380	This is where I should say shout out to Bip from Hebo, Oregon.
590380	591380	Hebo?
591380	593380	For giving us Reginald.
593380	594380	You cut out a little bit when you said your name.
594380	595380	Arthur McKenzie.
595380	596380	I didn't hear it.
596380	599380	Bip from Hebo, Oregon.
599380	601380	I also did not hear the name again.
601380	605380	Let's say Hebo, let's not say Hebo.
605380	611380	That sounds like somebody just slipped a slur past us.
611380	613380	What if the name is really Hebo though?
613380	616380	I think it's better safe than sorry.
616380	619380	Bet you're going to have to beep all of this out dude.
619380	622380	Yeah.
622380	627380	Dude, holy shit, the population of Hebo is 182.
627380	628380	Wow.
628380	629380	Small town.
629380	630380	They're a small town Bip.
630380	633380	I was born in a small town.
633380	637380	It's not even a town, it's an unincorporated census designated place.
637380	639380	In Tillamook County.
639380	641380	I bet it's beautiful there.
641380	644380	There's definitely something, this is where crazy shit would happen.
644380	649380	Yeah, it's named after Mount Hebo, there's a Mount Hebo Air Force base.
649380	650380	Now he's saying it.
650380	652380	Yeah dude, come on man.
652380	657380	Was the site of the Mount Hebo Air Force base until it closed in 1980.
657380	659380	So haunted Air Force base.
659380	660380	I wonder why it closed.
660380	662380	I wonder why it closed.
662380	666380	Find out on the next arc of our Patreon Delta Green game.
666380	674380	Guys, did you know 7.4% of the population there is 18 to 24.
674380	676380	Do you guys want to clap in to reset yourselves?
676380	677380	Sure.
677380	682380	Zach, have you fucking started having your classes of six year olds clap in to calm them
682380	683380	down?
683380	686380	No, do you guys want to sing what I sing?
686380	688380	Everyone's sitting nicely.
688380	692380	Everyone's sitting nicely.
692380	693380	Thank you.
693380	697380	And then I go around and I tell them each good job with their name and I give them a
697380	698380	high five and a low five.
698380	702380	Okay, but yeah, can you fucking resolve that melody though?
702380	703380	Nope.
703380	707380	So as you guys are literally falling upwards.
707380	712380	Keith is kind of content because he knows it's not actually happening to him.
712380	714380	You feel very physically content.
714380	716380	Physical distance wise, can I move?
716380	720380	Am I able to get closer to anybody in any way?
720380	724380	Oh yeah, and like the minute you get closer you're super far away from them and then you're
724380	725380	right next to them.
725380	727380	It's all kind of happening at the same time.
727380	732380	You're very much moving wherever you want to and further away.
732380	733380	That's cool.
733380	739380	The disconnect between the physical contentment he feels, the breakdown between his mind and
739380	747380	his body, not to mention the time and spatial anomalies means John Lee Pettymore just barfs
747380	749380	into this blackness.
749380	754380	All of a sudden the barf that is floating into this void turns the same color that you're
754380	761380	seeing all around this, which is this insane inky black darkness that is coming out of
761380	762380	you and the rest of you see it too.
762380	768380	It's the ooze that's coming out of John Lee Kevin Moore, the thirst mouth as he vomits,
768380	774380	but the ooze is like lighting up with sparks of this unnatural color that is just like
774380	776380	abreasting your eyes.
776380	781380	You have no idea how to handle this and your brain is essentially just like fucking melting
781380	786380	because it is just a complete overstimulation and at the same time physically you feel more
786380	792380	calm than you ever have in your life, maybe next to the time that you were commanded to
792380	797380	feel calm by that giant, gaunt, translucent skinned man.
797380	802380	God damn it, that fucking Uber driver was one of them things.
802380	804380	Whoa!
804380	807380	He says as he floats in and out of your view simultaneously.
807380	808380	Oh, well maybe not.
808380	810380	Hey, hey man.
810380	815380	You see that his pants are made out of a similar patchy material with all the clothes and you've
815380	819380	brought this character with you into the next part of the story.
819380	821380	Whoa, dude.
821380	822380	Fuck.
822380	823380	Is he laughing like that?
823380	824380	Yeah.
824380	825380	Is he feeling good about it?
825380	826380	Shit.
826380	827380	Yeah, dude.
827380	828380	Oh, man.
828380	830380	Why are you saying he though?
830380	831380	It's weird, man.
831380	833380	Is he feeling weird about it?
833380	837380	And he points at you and as he's pointing at you, you see that he's pointing at Keith
837380	840380	and he's pointing at John at the same time and he's kind of pointing at himself with
840380	844380	four fingers because that's what happens when you point a finger and he's like, dude,
844380	845380	dude.
845380	846380	What?
846380	851380	You see John looking at his fingers as he's pointing and he's like, holy shit, that's
851380	854380	right.
854380	859380	Except it's only three fingers that point back, not four.
859380	860380	It's true.
860380	863380	No, there's a fourth finger and there's not.
863380	870380	Keith reaches up to buckle his seatbelt and is concerned when it's not there.
870380	871380	It's not.
871380	877380	And as your hand reaches out, there's like a trail behind it of this color, like a like
877380	880380	tracer, like on the back of a bullet in a video game or something.
880380	882380	I don't know if that happens in real life.
882380	885380	I've never seen a bullet moving or not moving.
885380	890380	And as your hand moves, it's just like this crazy color scheme is just like failing behind
890380	891380	it.
891380	892380	Like you just won solitaire.
892380	897380	Thomas, you're going to say something about bullets?
897380	898380	Yeah.
898380	908380	Tracer, tracers happen when you have tracer rounds, which are bullets that are specially
908380	912380	designed to have a chem trail, have a chem trail.
912380	914380	Is that what's doing it?
914380	915380	Yeah.
915380	916380	Yeah.
916380	921380	You all see a series of scenes play out around you, the subjects in settings, like a hologram
921380	925380	made of the same unnatural light.
925380	931380	First, you see the sanctuary of the first church of contention decorated for a funeral.
931380	937380	Two coffins are closed up in front of the lectern with pictures of the deceased burn
937380	940380	victims on either side.
940380	947380	Adam Cain's parents looked happy in their wedding photo, but somehow even more joyful
947380	953380	in a JCPenney photo shoot with a smiling, toothless baby Adam Cain.
953380	959380	The orphaned boy with black eyes and a balloon head sneaks slowly out of a conversation with
959380	963380	extended relatives before running quickly for a closet door.
963380	966380	He does not, however, find the solace he seeks.
966380	973380	Rather, he finds himself in this small, dark space cluttered with old hymnals and extra
973380	976380	candles, one of which is lit.
976380	981380	And the orange light illuminates the face of a crazed, heartbroken Clark Bishop.
981380	982380	Nice.
982380	989380	He is not much older than he is here in this vacuum seemingly outside both time and space.
989380	996380	Clark reaches out and tucks a note into the inside pocket of Adam Cain's blazer previously
996380	1000380	only worn on Easter and Christmas Sunday.
1000380	1003380	The closet suddenly goes dark.
1003380	1008380	The balloon-headed boy pulls the metal chain attached to the singular bulb above and finds
1008380	1012380	himself alone with the spare songbooks and vigil lights.
1012380	1018380	He pulls out the note, unfolds it, and you all see a list of directions.
1018380	1024380	Underlined at the top is the sentence, one day, years from now, it will be imperative
1024380	1030380	that you replace Keith Vigna as Silas Cole, the founder of contention.
1030380	1036380	Step one outlines where to find and how to use the strange helmet Cain eventually bought
1036380	1037380	at Forgotten Treasures.
1037380	1043380	Step two includes an incantation that claims to change the shape of water.
1043380	1050380	Step three discusses the properties of the ooze and its relationship with fish and fish-filled
1050380	1051380	water.
1051380	1057380	Finally, at the bottom, it simply reads, I'm real sorry about your family.
1057380	1058380	That's crazy.
1058380	1062380	You don't want to change the shape of water because that film was very of its moment and
1062380	1065380	obviously it won the awards it won because of that.
1065380	1070380	And I think if you mess with that formula, it's just not going to be the same.
1070380	1074380	I mean, obviously it doesn't necessarily hold up to a lot of scrutiny, but come on, you
1074380	1075380	know.
1075380	1077380	The set design was just delightful.
1077380	1080380	Other than that, that's insane.
1080380	1085380	Literally, John Lee, Kevin Moore III, Clark Bishop, and Keith Vigna, seemingly as well
1085380	1089380	as this other man, Spud, witnessed this.
1089380	1094380	Are we physically seeing a scene play out before us in those moments or is it something
1094380	1095380	that's happening internally with us?
1095380	1097380	Oh no, it's external.
1097380	1100380	You can kind of see each other through and around it as well.
1100380	1101380	At the same time, you can't.
1101380	1104380	You're very much standing in that closet with them.
1104380	1109380	But you're also falling upward through this fucking bifrost.
1109380	1110380	Bifrost?
1110380	1111380	Yeah.
1111380	1115380	What does that mean?
1115380	1118380	Yeah, tell us more about that.
1118380	1119380	Where did you just let slip out?
1119380	1121380	It's just what that thing is.
1121380	1122380	It's a Thor thing.
1122380	1123380	The bifrost is how they get around.
1123380	1124380	Damn it.
1124380	1125380	It's a nerd.
1125380	1126380	Mythology.
1126380	1127380	It's a nerd thing?
1127380	1128380	No, it's not nerdy.
1128380	1130380	It's Norse mythology.
1130380	1133380	Is it?
1133380	1134380	It's pronounced bifrost.
1134380	1135380	Yeah, it is.
1135380	1140380	Bifrost is the rainbow bridge that connects Asgard with Midgard.
1140380	1141380	Duh.
1141380	1142380	It's real.
1142380	1143380	That's amazing.
1143380	1144380	I thought you were talking about something.
1144380	1145380	Wait, it's actually real?
1145380	1146380	It's real.
1146380	1151380	I thought we were talking about some bullshit that's fake.
1152380	1157380	I just meant that it's actual Norse mythology, not some Marvel shit.
1157380	1159380	So it's called beef roast?
1159380	1161380	It's called bifroast?
1161380	1162380	Beef roast.
1162380	1163380	Like Arby's.
1163380	1165380	Beef roast.
1165380	1172380	And as you're in this beef roast, just crock potting away, you do see, you're still looking
1172380	1177380	at this letter that says, I'm real sorry about your family.
1177380	1185380	The letters of the word family morph into the city skyline, but an out of place, massive
1185380	1190380	circle is moving quickly up toward the top of one of the tallest buildings.
1190380	1196380	Your view approaches in time to catch planet juggernaut with its two wild eyed partners
1196380	1202380	in tow, fling itself from the towering high rise, reach out with its powerful hands and
1202380	1208380	slam two helicopters together like a kid playing recklessly with sturdy toys.
1208380	1215380	Instantly, this wily child dons a helicopter hat as blades begin chopping the air above
1215380	1222380	the gigantic ball that lifts into the sky and slowly disappears into the horizon.
1222380	1229380	Your view zooms into the distance until it is engulfed in an ivory endlessness before
1229380	1236380	the experienced hand of one Vanna White touches it gently and a letter appears.
1236380	1243380	You all see John Lee Kevinmore, the third laying lazily, lying lazily on Clark's couch,
1243380	1246380	absolutely crushing wheel of fortune.
1246380	1253380	And then in the distance, fast approaching, you hear the whir of helicopter blades as
1253380	1260380	something massive and round blocks out the sun that previously poured into the windows
1260380	1263380	of the Bishop house.
1263380	1265380	Holy shit.
1265380	1272380	If we were to like reach out and try to interact with this, what happens?
1272380	1276380	Your hand kind of moves through it and does the same like tracer thing where it's just
1276380	1281380	like multiple versions of your hand are seen moving through it and the color displaces
1281380	1283380	and replaces and it's next to you.
1283380	1284380	It's behind you.
1284380	1285380	It's through you.
1285380	1286380	You're inside of it.
1286380	1291380	If you looked over at him, you would see John weeping, but it does seem like big, warm,
1291380	1292380	happy tears.
1292380	1294380	What is the puzzle?
1294380	1295380	What is the puzzle?
1295380	1297380	Like what is the word?
1297380	1304380	Um, yeah, the, um, the puzzle is, um, meet me in St. Louis Armstrong.
1304380	1305380	That's a good one.
1305380	1308380	Nice way to pull that out.
1309380	1314380	This guy is like in there with you and he's like, whoa, is that you?
1314380	1317380	And he's like looking at both of you as, as this happens.
1317380	1319380	He's like, what the fuck?
1319380	1325380	John wipes the tear from his eyes and he's like, it was, it might be again.
1325380	1327380	I think it's a version of us.
1327380	1331380	I think it is an us that was, it's not now we're, we're here, right?
1331380	1334380	And I try and touch somebody, whoever's nearest.
1334380	1336380	Can I put, can I make contact with someone?
1336380	1340380	I also am reaching out to touch spud and see if he's real.
1340380	1345380	You both absolutely feel real physical contact and as well, your hand moves through them
1345380	1347380	completely, but it's also very real.
1347380	1349380	So fucking cool.
1349380	1351380	It is, but it's not.
1351380	1354380	And then at the same time is.
1356380	1360380	Does his pillowy touch bring bud to an ivory andlessness?
1360380	1362380	Spud.
1363380	1364380	Yeah.
1364380	1366380	And no.
1368380	1371380	In case you said velvety for Vanna White.
1371380	1373380	Here's a line reading of me saying velvety.
1373380	1374380	Velvety?
1374380	1376380	I didn't, but that was good.
1376380	1377380	Punch that in.
1377380	1379380	What did you say?
1379380	1381380	Experienced hand.
1381380	1383380	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
1383380	1385380	Shut the fuck up.
1387380	1391380	Does his experienced hand bring him to an ivory andlessness?
1395380	1403380	Dude, an experienced hand has brought me to an ivory andlessness so many times.
1410380	1411380	Oh my God.
1411380	1412380	Oh man.
1413380	1414380	Oh fuck.
1417380	1419380	The shadows cast by the imminent.
1419380	1420380	Oh, sorry.
1420380	1425380	Keith pulls his phone out to see like on the Uber app, like where he is.
1428380	1430380	You're like 2.2 now?
1430380	1434380	No, I'm at like physically the location of where he is.
1434380	1436380	You can see it dropping.
1437380	1440380	Yeah, he's like rating you on his phone.
1440380	1444380	He's like, this is the craziest Uber ride.
1444380	1448380	Not the most charismatic partner through eternity.
1449380	1450380	So far.
1450380	1452380	Where does it say we are though?
1452380	1453380	Oh, your phone.
1453380	1457380	When you look at your phone, you see your reflection is Silas Cole.
1457380	1459380	Oh shit.
1459380	1460380	Fuck yeah.
1462380	1463380	Guys, what do I look like?
1463380	1464380	I look at him.
1464380	1469380	He's wearing stupid shorts and a stupid shirt and he looks like his stupid fucking self.
1469380	1471380	You look like your stupid fucking self, Keith.
1471380	1476380	Look, and I show him my phone trying to show him my reflection.
1476380	1481380	You see an old grizzled version of yourself wearing a hood over the top as the overseer
1481380	1485380	that you've seen so many times and a light begins beaming out of your face.
1485380	1486380	What do I look like?
1486380	1487380	What do I look like?
1487380	1488380	And I start feeling my own head.
1488380	1489380	You look like you.
1489380	1491380	What do I look like in Keith's magic phone?
1491380	1495380	I show my magic phone to John Lee Pettymore.
1495380	1496380	You don't see anything.
1496380	1498380	He peers deeply, yeah.
1498380	1503380	His eyes are bulgy and he's trying so hard to see something in the phone screen.
1503380	1508380	It eventually zooms out to encapsulate all of Planet Juggernaut.
1508380	1513380	John Lee Pettymore experiences a high freehandlessness.
1516380	1519380	I want to show the phone to Spud and see what he sees.
1519380	1522380	What?
1522380	1523380	What do you see, man?
1523380	1526380	Dude, it's me.
1526380	1528380	That's nuts.
1529380	1531380	You look about like you expected.
1531380	1533380	I mean, who are we really?
1533380	1539380	Sometimes I just like stand in the mirror and stare for as long as I can until my eyes
1539380	1543380	are the only thing I can really see and the rest just kind of fades away.
1543380	1548380	And then I slowly move my head back and forth from side to side but try to keep my eyes
1548380	1550380	in like the same spot.
1550380	1552380	It's fucking crazy, man.
1552380	1555380	Alright Spud, we'll check back in with you later.
1555380	1563380	The shadows cast by the imminent Planet Juggernaut form a thick metal blast door in a dank, dimly
1563380	1566380	lit subterranean laboratory.
1566380	1572380	Keith Vigna stands on the outside wearing clothes that fit in around 1880-something
1572380	1578380	and jots in a notebook as he looks through a porthole where you all see Tildy B. Mitchell's
1578380	1581380	body convulsing on the floor.
1581380	1587380	Her leg is stabbing into the cement ground rhythmically as it turns into a piece of machinery
1587380	1591380	on a beautiful sunny day at the Contention Mining Company.
1591380	1598380	As Keith Beans walks past his workers and into his office, he's met with hearty greetings.
1598380	1599380	Good day, boss.
1599380	1600380	How do you do, sir?
1600380	1602380	Take care, Mr. Cole.
1602380	1609380	You watch as the physique changes around the mouth making the greeting and see a rotund,
1609380	1615380	sweat-covered man finish the previous thought like a before and after on Wheel of Fortune
1615380	1617380	as he says,
1619380	1622380	Mr. Cole needs to be taken care of.
1624380	1625380	Fucking impeccable.
1625380	1627380	That's an artist right there.
1627380	1629380	That's a professional artist right there.
1629380	1631380	Oh, it's like, it feels bad.
1631380	1632380	It hurts.
1632380	1633380	Did you hear that?
1633380	1634380	Oh, my God.
1634380	1635380	Some of it came back out.
1635380	1636380	It was so gurgly.
1636380	1637380	I think you need to wipe.
1637380	1640380	I literally had spindrift in my mouth on that burp.
1640380	1641380	Oh, God.
1641380	1644380	I'm so glad you didn't just puke onto your microphone just now.
1644380	1647380	It sounds like you aspirated some spindrift.
1647380	1648380	Oh, my God.
1648380	1653380	I'm so glad you didn't just puke onto your microphone just now.
1653380	1656380	It sounds like you aspirated some spindrift.
1656380	1657380	Oh, my God.
1657380	1661380	I'm so glad you didn't just puke onto your microphone just now.
1662380	1666380	Did you go to jail for murdering some 41?
1666380	1668380	Some's 41.
1668380	1671380	Some 41 told me.
1672380	1674380	Okay, you guys want to keep going?
1674380	1678380	Yeah, I'm waiting for something to, you know,
1678380	1680380	I mean, not that stuff isn't happening,
1680380	1683380	but I'm waiting for, like, to be able to do something.
1683380	1686380	I'm waiting for you to wow me.
1686380	1689380	I want to, like, because I'm just,
1689380	1692380	we're just flailing and floating right now, you know?
1692380	1693380	Yeah, it's an audio podcast.
1693380	1695380	You can always talk to each other.
1695380	1696380	Nah.
1696380	1698380	This is crazy.
1701380	1704380	So, wait, is the Silas Cole flashback,
1704380	1706380	it ends with Ephraim saying that?
1706380	1707380	That's the end of that?
1707380	1708380	Nope, I'm in the middle of it.
1708380	1709380	That's what I thought.
1709380	1710380	Okay.
1710380	1711380	Finish out your phone.
1711380	1713380	I mean, we've all been, we've all been real silly,
1713380	1716380	but Judge Ephraim Courtland was anything but.
1716380	1718380	This meeting he had called was about to decide
1718380	1721380	if they, the elders of contention,
1721380	1725380	should hire this roaming cowboy, Cornelius Beans,
1725380	1729380	to dispose of their town's paranoid figurehead.
1729380	1732380	All in attendance were in favor and said aye.
1732380	1736380	The judge excused himself to fetch this mercenary for hire
1736380	1738380	who just happened to be in town for the day,
1738380	1742380	and Cornelius Beans later entered the secret meeting
1742380	1744380	to spit and shake on the deal.
1744380	1748380	The handshake transforms into a live hand grasping
1748380	1752380	the cold, limp grip of a body that drapes
1752380	1755380	like a frequently worn sweater in a closet.
1755380	1758380	This closet, however, is down in a crawl space
1758380	1761380	six feet deep with dirt floors.
1761380	1765380	It smells heavily like rich earth and cedar,
1765380	1769380	and there are rows of other long hanging cadavers
1769380	1771380	suspended from the supports.
1771380	1775380	A small metal ball with long metal tendrils
1775380	1780380	excuses itself from the beans-dubbed cowboy shell
1780380	1784380	it inhabited and enters its familiar host,
1784380	1788380	known to the town of contention as Mary Cole.
1788380	1792380	She walks up the dusty wooden stairs, enters the house,
1792380	1795380	and begins to chant an incantation she remembers
1795380	1798380	from her maker's lips.
1799380	1803380	A swirling hole opens in the ground,
1803380	1807380	and Keith Beans wakes up from a deep sleep,
1807380	1811380	eyes wide and horrified, as Mary Cole,
1811380	1814380	this woman standing in his bedroom
1814380	1816380	with old timey clothing on,
1816380	1821380	throws her creator into the eternal portal,
1821380	1823380	filling the bedroom floor.
1823380	1826380	And then, as you're falling upward,
1826380	1831380	your vision fades, and the light refocuses
1831380	1834380	on the three of you.
1834380	1836380	Holy shit.
1836380	1838380	Hey, Luke, you remember the first dream you had
1838380	1840380	as Keith Vigna?
1840380	1843380	You were still dreaming, but you woke up in your bed
1843380	1845380	and you saw a woman in your time in clothing.
1845380	1846380	Oh, yes, yes.
1846380	1848380	Threw me through the floor.
1848380	1850380	Oh.
1850380	1853380	Oh.
1853380	1855380	That's fucking incredible, dude.
1855380	1858380	That's wild.
1858380	1860380	Who was it?
1865380	1867380	Damn, dude, that was so long ago.
1867380	1869380	Holy shit.
1869380	1871380	Jesus, dude.
1871380	1873380	That's just really cool.
1873380	1875380	Did you all saw?
1875380	1877380	There was a ball.
1877380	1879380	It had tendrils.
1879380	1881380	It's one of the balls, right?
1881380	1884380	You guys saw that, right?
1884380	1887380	John just rolls his eyes like,
1887380	1889380	duh, it was a ball.
1889380	1892380	Keith is having just flashbacks to that dream
1892380	1895380	and trying to piece things together in his mind,
1895380	1899380	but also he still isn't fully convinced
1899380	1902380	that any of this is actually happening to him.
1902380	1906380	Keith, the stuff that I saw,
1906380	1909380	it wasn't something I remember, per se,
1909380	1912380	but it all kind of touched on things
1912380	1915380	that I could understand being a thing.
1915380	1917380	What you just saw, was that anything
1917380	1919380	that rings a bell for you?
1919380	1922380	Did you see anything that rings true?
1922380	1927380	I had a dream and she was there.
1927380	1929380	She was there.
1929380	1931380	I had a dream and she was there.
1931380	1935380	I think it's M-A-R-Y.
1935380	1938380	What does that stand for again, Keith?
1938380	1945380	Oh, that stands for...
1945380	1948380	Marvin's Awesome Robots, y'all.
1948380	1952380	It was something like,
1952380	1958380	Y was the version of it, and it's M-A-R.
1958380	1961380	Manipulating Activator Robot.
1961380	1964380	Yeah, version Y.
1964380	1966380	Marvy.
1966380	1968380	Marvy, Marx.
1968380	1971380	Marvy, Mars, Marx.
1971380	1975380	A lot of these were cooler than Mary.
1975380	1977380	Seemingly out of nowhere,
1977380	1979380	you're all sitting on the ground.
1979380	1981380	Above you is pure darkness,
1981380	1984380	the same darkness you've seen above you this whole time,
1984380	1989380	and beneath you, the ground is made of pure light.
1989380	1993380	But as your eyes adjust to your new surroundings,
1993380	1996380	the endlessness of it all begins to fade away,
1996380	2001380	and you see you're actually all sitting on the ground in a small room.
2001380	2005380	It feels smaller due to the amount of junk accumulated around you,
2005380	2008380	like a hoarder studio apartment.
2008380	2012380	And you hear a whiny moan,
2012380	2017380	pained from behind a jostling pile of clutter.
2017380	2024380	Who's there? Who's there?
2024380	2027380	Leo?
2027380	2029380	Who knows me? Who is that?
2029380	2031380	Is it Leo?
2031380	2033380	It's Clark. Leo, it's Clark.
2033380	2036380	Clark Bishop, you motherfucker.
2036380	2042380	And this jostling amount of junk just falls over,
2042380	2044380	pours over onto the ground,
2044380	2047380	the real ground now below you that is still made of light,
2047380	2051380	and it falls over, and he falls toward you,
2051380	2054380	and you see as he falls on his face in front of you,
2054380	2056380	it is very clearly Leo Piston.
2056380	2061380	He looks exactly like he did the night that he stood atop the two-fanged plunge,
2061380	2065380	and a bullet was fired through his body by Julie Maxwell,
2065380	2067380	who then you shot in the eye.
2067380	2070380	And as he falls forward, you do see he's shirtless,
2070380	2074380	and the skin kind of like falls and hits the ground below,
2074380	2079380	and the fat on his sides kind of presses against all the junk
2079380	2081380	that is down there next to him,
2081380	2085380	and you see a very clear exit wound from where,
2085380	2090380	or an entrance wound from where the bullet went through him,
2090380	2091380	and he's like,
2091380	2100380	Oh, I'm in so much pain, and this is all you felt.
2100380	2105380	Oh, dammit, it's sixth-cent style ghosts.
2105380	2109380	I'm no ghost.
2109380	2111380	I didn't hear what he said.
2111380	2112380	It kind of cut out.
2112380	2115380	I'm no ghost.
2115380	2117380	Oh.
2117380	2119380	You're not real.
2119380	2120380	You're not real.
2120380	2122380	It fucking hurts.
2122380	2124380	It still hurts.
2124380	2125380	I turned to the guys.
2125380	2127380	This can't be real.
2127380	2128380	He's dead.
2128380	2129380	He's dead.
2129380	2130380	He's dead.
2130380	2132380	We saw his body slide down the slide.
2132380	2134380	Well, yeah, and now we're probably dead, too,
2134380	2136380	because we suffocated news,
2136380	2141380	and we're up here in sixth-cent ghost hell with Leo.
2141380	2143380	His body got caught by the goo.
2143380	2145380	Yeah, just like us.
2145380	2146380	The goo got him.
2146380	2148380	It slammed him in the ground, didn't it?
2148380	2149380	Oh, yeah.
2149380	2150380	It fucking hurt, too.
2150380	2152380	It slammed me in the ground so many times.
2152380	2154380	I've been in your unconscious for a while,
2154380	2155380	and you'll have it in.
2155380	2157380	Well, about five days, Leo, I think.
2157380	2159380	I was going to say, how long has it been?
2159380	2160380	Two and a half years?
2160380	2165380	It feels like forever since you've been gone.
2165380	2167380	Please come back home.
2167380	2171380	Has anybody ever told you you kind of sound like Adam Sandler
2171380	2173380	at his worst impulses?
2173380	2176380	Eh.
2176380	2178380	Heh.
2178380	2180380	Does Adam Sandler exist in this universe?
2180380	2183380	John Lee Pennymore doesn't want to exist in a universe
2183380	2185380	that Adam Sandler doesn't.
2185380	2192380	Ha ha ha!
2192380	2196380	Clark is going to have a look of dawning realization.
2196380	2198380	He starts looking around.
2198380	2200380	Does that mean, is she here?
2200380	2203380	Leo, is Julie here?
2203380	2204380	Eh.
2204380	2206380	Julie was dead.
2206380	2208380	My body was here.
2208380	2210380	My body was here.
2210380	2215380	And he points to the ground nearby,
2215380	2216380	and there's no body.
2216380	2217380	And his eyes get huge.
2217380	2219380	And he's like, Jesus.
2219380	2220380	She was there.
2220380	2226380	And then, as fuck you not, this little metal ball
2226380	2230380	fell down the same way you guys just did.
2230380	2235380	And this little spider worm arms climbed up into her face.
2236380	2240380	And she stood up out of nowhere.
2240380	2246380	And this black ooze started pouring out of her eyeball.
2246380	2248380	Well, you shot her.
2248380	2249380	Meh.
2249380	2252380	Just darkness pouring out of her eye.
2252380	2254380	And then what, Leo?
2254380	2255380	Where'd she go?
2255380	2258380	And he points at a large metal door.
2258380	2260380	Like a hatch.
2260380	2262380	Are there any windows in the room we're in?
2262380	2263380	No.
2263380	2269380	Is this the same room that I was in in the pond?
2269380	2270380	Nope.
2270380	2272380	And are we saying hatch because it's on the ground?
2272380	2274380	No, sorry.
2274380	2276380	It's on the wall like a door.
2276380	2278380	I don't know why I'm saying hatch.
2278380	2280380	I think it's just like the big rectangle.
2280380	2283380	It actually looks like a walk-in freezer, I guess.
2283380	2284380	Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure.
2284380	2285380	Gotcha, yeah.
2285380	2286380	That kind of thing.
2286380	2289380	Sorry, I'm just really bad with words.
2289380	2292380	Yeah, you're pretty much known for that.
2292380	2296380	Just control the story and the imagery.
2296380	2298380	That's fine.
2302380	2305380	I'm going to ship you a dictionary.
2305380	2308380	I'm glad you finished that last word.
2308380	2310380	I'm going to show you my dick.
2310380	2313380	Me too, yeah.
2313380	2315380	I'll show you a hard wire.
2315380	2317380	Oh my god.
2317380	2321380	Dude, fucking, okay, Harry Potter pornography Hagrid.
2321380	2325380	I'm going to show you my dictionary.
2325380	2326380	Nice.
2326380	2329380	And then he pronounces everything very, very well.
2329380	2332380	Yeah, it's not porn, it's just a lesson.
2332380	2334380	It's a public speaking lesson?
2334380	2335380	A sex lesson.
2335380	2337380	It is porn.
2337380	2339380	Hagrid porn.
2339380	2343380	So Leo here says that Julie was dead.
2343380	2348380	So I was under the assumption that we were in some sort of afterlife here, but maybe
2348380	2349380	that's not the case.
2349380	2354380	Maybe when she shot Leo, it was not a fatal wound.
2354380	2356380	It was the goo that got him.
2356380	2359380	It wasn't, not fatal.
2359380	2366380	Do you think the goo arrested his, would he have died from his wound if he was still in
2366380	2367380	the real world?
2367380	2369380	Maybe time passes differently here.
2369380	2371380	I don't know, I'm not a doctor.
2371380	2372380	That's surprising.
2372380	2375380	I've got thirty first aid, could I tell?
2375380	2378380	If it would have been a fatal wound five days ago.
2378380	2384380	Thinking back to five days ago, really though, a lot longer ago than five days ago, I'd
2384380	2386380	imagine, in your fucked up brain.
2386380	2387380	Oh, sure.
2387380	2391380	Yeah, go ahead and roll.
2391380	2392380	I fail.
2392380	2394380	Forty-one on a thirty.
2394380	2397380	Yeah, you're not, you're not sure.
2397380	2398380	Certainly not sure.
2398380	2402380	You're about as sure as Joe would be either way on whether or not that wound would be
2402380	2403380	fatal.
2403380	2404380	Yep, yep, yep.
2404380	2408380	And then is, is freezer door hatch the only door in this room?
2408380	2411380	The only way we would be able to get in or out?
2411380	2413380	No, looking now, there's two of them.
2413380	2415380	One on either side of the room.
2415380	2421380	As you're talking, you saw like at Leo, Leo's literally just like crawling around knocking
2421380	2427380	shit over, and he knocks over enough clutter on the opposite side of the room to reveal
2427380	2431380	a second door that was unseen previous.
2431380	2436380	Cause he's literally, you're looking into the eyes of a man who is feeling a fatal wound
2436380	2440380	constantly, and he's just crying out in pain the whole time.
2440380	2448380	I, I'm not going to keep doing it, but his wheezing, his like moaning, his is literally
2448380	2450380	happening constantly.
2450380	2453380	It's honestly pretty relaxing.
2453380	2457380	So you're not like a dedicated enough actor to keep doing it?
2457380	2458380	Sorry.
2461380	2470380	Guys, now, see, now I believe that this fellow is in pain.
2470380	2475380	This is a man having a hard time and that, that comes across.
2475380	2481380	Should, should we put him out of his misery?
2481380	2483380	Uh, no, no.
2483380	2489380	He's, he's the only one that seems to have any knowledge about what's going on here.
2489380	2490380	However little it may be.
2490380	2492380	I don't think we should get rid of him at least, at least yet.
2492380	2493380	Yeah.
2493380	2495380	He's got a decent frame of reference for right now.
2495380	2498380	And also it's, he is being kept alive in here.
2498380	2507380	And even though he's been going through unspeakable pain for five whole days, we, we could probably
2507380	2508380	get him out of here.
2508380	2511380	Keith says nothing, but isn't so sure.
2511380	2513380	Well, God damn it, Keith.
2513380	2518380	I can tell that you're, you're not, you're not saying anything, but you're thinking something
2518380	2521380	that you're, you're afraid to say, well, I'm not afraid to say it.
2521380	2527380	You think we can't get out of here, but if you fucking believe that, then what is, what
2527380	2528380	is any of this for?
2528380	2534380	What's, why, why keep going if you don't think we can get out of this fucking ooze falling
2534380	2539380	upwards, goddamn Leo dying for five days bullshit?
2539380	2541380	Guys, we're all just in the Uber still.
2541380	2543380	I believe we can get out of here.
2543380	2544380	That's fine.
2544380	2546380	Spud, do you believe we're still in the Uber?
2546380	2549380	Spud is kind of walking towards one of the doors.
2549380	2552380	What the fuck, dude?
2552380	2557380	This is, he's just kind of pacing back and forth.
2557380	2561380	Now he was walking away and now he's walking toward you and now he's walking away.
2561380	2566380	Um, and he's just pacing back and forth and he's like, this is not diet.
2566380	2568380	The last thing that was sick though.
2568380	2570380	I was like, why?
2570380	2575380	And I was like, yo, and you guys are all different and stuff and it was crazy.
2575380	2581380	But this, this guy, I don't know, he's, um, my ears.
2581380	2586380	Do, do we still have the feeling of contentment that we had while we were on the road?
2586380	2587380	Oh yeah.
2587380	2588380	Oh yeah.
2588380	2589380	Super content.
2589380	2590380	I don't know what I was complaining about then.
2590380	2593380	I guess this ain't so bad.
2593380	2598380	Leo, do you feel content even though you're dying in pain constantly?
2598380	2607380	I feel like I'm dying, but also like I'm not hungry if that's what you mean.
2607380	2611380	And I don't think I've slept the whole time I've been here except for being unconscious maybe.
2611380	2614380	Is that what I mean?
2614380	2615380	No.
2615380	2617380	That you're not hungry?
2617380	2618380	Is that what content is?
2618380	2619380	I guess it's a big ol' no.
2619380	2621380	I was just trying to describe my physical state to you.
2621380	2622380	He's not hungry.
2622380	2623380	He's not sleepy.
2623380	2625380	He is in pain, but he's managing.
2625380	2627380	Is this a riddle or is this meat?
2627380	2631380	We're detectives' greatest detectives, so we're just thinking out loud.
2631380	2635380	I don't, I don't know about you guys, but I don't think there's much more we can do here.
2635380	2639380	I think, I think if we're going to find a way out, we got to start trying to find a way out.
2639380	2641380	Shh.
2641380	2646380	Do you, do you guys think we should go out the door that Julie went out or do you think we should go out that one?
2646380	2647380	Can I point to the other one?
2647380	2649380	I kind of like Spud's instincts.
2649380	2650380	I don't know.
2650380	2651380	Which one did he go to?
2651380	2659380	Spud throws open the latch on the hatch that was first visible in this unearthly piston junkyard of a room,
2659380	2666380	and he turns back to fully face you with double finger guns as the door behind him swings open.
2666380	2672380	Without turning back around to confirm his footing, he steps backward over the threshold.
2672380	2682380	Dudes, we got to find a way out of this place, and my instincts are on point!
2682380	2692380	Spud, with nothing for his feet to land on, falls back and disappears completely from your view as his voice trails off and turns to a shriek.
2692380	2700380	And beyond the doorway, you all look out and see a technicolor sky your eyes cannot quite comprehend.
2700380	2704380	And it is, at the same time, completely dark.
2704380	2714380	The nothingness is endless, but below the horizon is a shimmering silver sea.
2716380	2718380	Holy shit! This is so cool!
2718380	2723380	Well, I thought we should just maybe follow him through that door, but now I'd like to peek through first.
2723380	2726380	I was gonna, like, weed like three stooges' heads.
2726380	2729380	Yeah, what's down below if we...
2729380	2741380	Looking down, you see this room you're all in is on stilts, and a ladder goes down about ten yards and disappears into this placid, shining ocean
2741380	2747380	that surrounds Leo's auxiliary piston junkyard for as far as you can see.
2747380	2757380	But just below, Spud is laying on top of this gleaming expanse, and his face is contorted into a twisted grimace.
2759380	2780380	A pained squeak is drowned out into a gargle as the patch-covered hippie slowly sinks backward in Han Solo pose, down into the shimmering silver sea.
2781380	2784380	Johnny Kevin Moore shuts the door.
2786380	2788380	Clarky yanks it back open.
2788380	2790380	Let's try that other one, guys.
2790380	2791380	I gotta see how this ends.
2791380	2793380	I help him open the door.
2793380	2795380	Say your piece and then I'll close this damn door.
2795380	2798380	As you look out the door a second time...
2798380	2800380	Oh, look who it is.
2800380	2801380	No, Justin.
2801380	2810380	You see a boat made of this familiar inky black, unnaturally colorful material that also makes up the sky.
2810380	2814380	And two men are standing on this craft.
2814380	2817380	One is a short stout man in his latter years.
2817380	2822380	A thick white beard makes his round face look even rounder.
2822380	2826380	The bags under his eyes are large and fluffy.
2826380	2833380	He's wearing a dark navy beanie and a wool plaid shirt under olive corduroy overalls.
2833380	2840380	And the other man is John Lee Pettymore IV's uncle, Don D. Pettymore.
2840380	2844380	Justin, what does Uncle Don look like?
2844380	2849380	Ooh, Uncle Don is about 6'2", kind of sinewy.
2849380	2857380	He's got that leathery, been out in the sun too long, strong, dark hair that's very disheveled right now.
2857380	2862380	Does not look as though he has bathed in quite some time, let's say.
2862380	2865380	And he's wearing like a buttoned up shirt that's all like...
2865380	2869380	It's not looking super great in a thick ol' mustache.
2869380	2873380	Uh, hi, Uncle Don.
2873380	2874380	What, how...
2874380	2877380	Wait, do I see...
2877380	2880380	Is that John?
2880380	2882380	Oh, he sees me.
2882380	2884380	Hey, Uncle Don, uh...
2884380	2886380	I start going down the ladder.
2886380	2888380	Can't we check the other door first?
2888380	2890380	Don, you could climb up the ladder.
2890380	2900380	Keith goes down the ladder, but he does it like in a video game when you hit the sprint button when you go down and you just like hold the side and slide down it.
2900380	2904380	Yeah, like, he does that.
2904380	2908380	But again, like, we're still up here in this other plane, there's a whole other door.
2908380	2913380	Who knows who he might invite to the Discord chat if we open that door.
2913380	2917380	LAUGHTER
2943380	2947380	LAUGHTER
2974380	2979380	What kind of world are you living in?
2982380	2988380	What kind of world are you living in?
