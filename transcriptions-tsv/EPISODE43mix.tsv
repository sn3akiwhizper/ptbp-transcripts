0	7280	What's good, my friends? Y'all want to know what's really good? Your boy Wolf the dog sure does
7720	14960	What's really good is me being your host on the greatest show in the known and unknown universe
15680	19400	six nine four point two PTBP
20720	26660	The only show that will let y'all know what's really going on in all the dimensions
27060	31540	Suck it NPR. What do you fools even know about the 27th dimension?
32620	38640	Speaking of other dimensions this week's howling with wolf comes from Justin Jay from the Twitter
38980	45420	Dimension who tagged that pretending pod in a tweet about benching the whole show in four days. Whoa
45940	49480	Hell yeah, Justin Jay on Twitter. They write
49620	53740	Hey wolf long time listener first time howler
53740	56580	I wanted to give a shout out to my best friend Dan

92060	94060	I like your name
94500	100380	Justin it reminds me of a name I once had in a past life in another dimension
100900	106740	I look forward to seeing you Friday probably but you will not see me on Friday
107700	114300	Probably I like to hang out from afar usually using some binoculars or telescopes just
114780	115860	watching
115860	118940	Waiting until the time is just right
120740	125780	Remember if you want to write up something for your wolf the how tag at pretending pod on

161020	163020	Gorgeous stunning
163140	167620	Delightful it can't be but it is it's the news
168740	170420	with Keith vigna
170420	178620	Unconscious Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore took turns tossing grenades into the maw of the atrociously massive fish person creature
179180	183300	Doug Jacobs in the body of agent Trent Chad was
183820	186420	decapitated by the scythe of a fishy humanoid
186820	193440	This same gamey bipedal amphibian then lodged that scythe into the skull of Kathy piston
193580	200860	John Lee Kevin Moore was swallowed whole by Big Daddy fish monster, but swam through the whole Keith made previously
201380	208700	However, an unseen force dragged his body down to the bottom of the tank up against the glass of that
209340	215940	gargantuan aquarium in Kevin Lee Pettymore made direct eye contact with Marvin glass as
216460	218460	lungs filled with water
218900	226520	Like the lead singer the pussycat dolls once said don't hold your breath. It's kudzu with no backbone, baby
246420	248420	Oh
249940	253500	My mama made me miss my M&Ms. Oh my
255020	260280	Hey Clark, hey Joe, you can you can call me Clark you can call me Clark
261100	263100	Clark you are
263220	269260	Standing on the wet catwalk above this murky water in this dank room
269540	274700	Keith vigna is in your arms and in front of you both is the lone
275620	277620	Standing fish man
278220	281460	Just previously the giant monstrosity
282460	287180	That is in the deep and four times bigger than the normal fish man
287900	292660	swallowed John Lee Pettymore John Lee Kevin more hole and
293660	296420	Then dove into the depths below
298020	303700	We are still in combat and shit it is the top of the order which means
304740	306740	It is Clark Bishop's turn
307060	309900	Looking down into the water. Can I see big fish boy?
309900	315020	Or is he just completely out of sight at this point completely out of sight at this point? Okay
315020	318340	I'm going to take a shot at the fish man in front of me
318500	323820	Go ahead and roll firearms as you kind of back up with Keith vigna in your arms
323820	330340	You are backing into a part of the catwalk that has been ripped down by the giant monstrosity
330340	335180	So there's water behind you. Do you roll a successful firearms check?
335180	340300	I did a 13 on an 80. All right, go ahead and roll a d10 for me for damage
341660	346420	For all right, so there's no catwalk behind me at all. No, it has been ripped down
346940	353580	Could I make a maneuver across that corner? You would have to roll an athletics check at a negative 20%
354620	359580	Because you're holding on to Keith vigna. I would give you a negative 40 but Keith vigna
360060	365100	He's a rubbery guy. He's pretty easy to hold on to I don't feel like I can risk it
365100	367900	So I'll just wait and see what happens. All righty
367900	373420	But it's the fish man that's in front of me is blocking my way us ostensibly ostensibly
373420	376500	He is even though he's on the opposite side of the elevator door
377100	381260	He is still blocking your way because behind you in between you in the elevator door
381740	387200	It's just this torn down catwalk and you're not sure if you jump down into it with a couple
387360	389360	Feet of water up on to your knees
389880	395440	It might break all the way off and fall into the depths plunge below
396320	398320	so it is this
399160	406720	It looks like a human. Honestly, it does it looks like a human person that has been genetically modified or
407280	410200	grown and birthed in some
410920	415440	Unnatural way to make them look like this and sure your everyday monstrosity
416040	420440	Exactly, and this everyday monstrosity is coming at you with a massive scythe
421280	424840	And it fails its rule. Thank God
424960	431560	So it kind of lunges toward you and you move just right out of the way as it comes for you and it's back to
431560	435880	You it's just gonna go back and forth here. Oh for real. Yes, sir. So what would you like to do?
435880	442240	What are damage mechanics if I wanted to use that scythe against him
442240	446640	Could I use an unarmed combat to take that flail at me and turn it on him?
446640	448640	I think we've done that before. Yeah, actually
449200	456960	You can you can absolutely do that. Yes. Okay, I'm gonna show that would mean you're gonna basically do unarmed combat
456960	458960	Okay against him. So go ahead and roll that. I
459960	461960	I
462960	469080	Pass a 38 on a 70 he's gonna try to fight back and he failed with a 91 fuck
469080	475640	yeah, so what you're gonna do is it with this you can take control of his scythe and
476520	483320	Do damage with it. So that damage is a d8 plus two. So go ahead and roll that for me. Oh, dude
483320	485780	I don't think I have a d8 sitting out. Do you I have a d8?
486540	491620	It's one of the nice metal ones that you gave me sweet. I hope it rolls an eight
492740	494740	It fucking did
496580	502780	Yeah, that is it had six hit points left with fuck two armor
505340	511300	You take it just down to zero do you want to describe how you take control of this fish man's
511700	519140	Main weapon and take it down when he came swinging at me and he totally whiffed in the air my gun hand I
519740	526780	Reached out and wrapped my arm around at that peg or that the stick of the scythe. Absolutely and just lunge forward
527180	533340	I was probably wanting to aim as high as I could to decapitate but we'll see how high that got me
533460	535920	It got him like maybe oh it goes
535920	537600	It goes straight
537600	544220	Straight through one of its gills on the side of its neck and you actually see a the scythe goes
544520	550160	Into the gills and comes out of the fish man's mouth with the human teeth
550640	557520	And so the point of the scythe is coming out through its big smile. That's a nice little kung-fu move. I put on that boy
558720	561560	And as you do that it falls
562440	566980	Onto the catwalk next to you and you are standing in this
567760	569080	murky
569080	571080	damp dank
571540	576200	prison torture chamber aquatic mess by yourself
577360	582000	Keith vigna is in your arms. You did all that with him like as a puppet and
582760	584920	Like a marionette like in front of you
585320	587080	Yeah
587080	593480	Are we still in combat orders do I need to know and as you stand there kind of reeling from this
594320	596320	you feel a
596800	602280	Rumble from beneath and looking down you see this massive explosion
602560	609100	Happen deep down in the water and the bubbles start coming and they don't stop coming
610020	615460	John Lee Pettymore got fed to the fish and he hit the ground running did him. All right, so
616460	621060	as these bubbles are hitting top of the water so to a
622660	624920	Massive fish side
627020	630860	Humanoid flank of fish flank of fish
632860	635980	Floats to the top of the water
636260	640540	That's either a really good sign or a really bad and then on the other side of you
640980	646560	You see the bottom half of this monstrosity with its weird legs
646860	650700	Fused together and it's tight tight genitals
651860	653860	in between and
653980	660720	Next to it. You see the bottom half of George piston and the top half of George piston
660720	662240	I
662240	666320	Said that's an okay half to see as far as knowing that John's down there
666840	670160	And I need you to roll a sanity check. Oh shit
676960	685120	I do not pass. It's a 30 on a 16. Okay. I need you to go down to 15 losing one sanity and
686080	688840	you just break down in this room and
689560	693720	As you're standing there holding the body of Keith Wigner
694200	696640	crying as a God
697360	699200	Who has failed?
699200	700480	ding
700480	702780	The elevator door opens up
706600	708600	Oh, do you want it to be empty
709920	711920	Did you think it would be empty
712360	717160	a little afraid of getting at all this and then fighting some in an elevator, so
717480	720920	I guess we'll see what's happening. It's empty. Oh
723000	729280	Thank God is Keith in my arms do I think he's dead as I'm holding him or do I know that he's
730080	732840	Unconscious or whatever roll a first aid check. Okay. Oh
737080	739000	Fuck
739000	743040	Shit at 38 on a 30. All right, so close he is
744700	746700	Super dead
747160	749040	I
749040	751040	Drop him in the water
752360	755040	Burial at sea. No, I'm not gonna drop him in the water
755040	759720	I'm gonna try I want to get to the elevator and I just want to throw him between
760120	764560	The threshold like over the threshold so that the doors can't close. Okay, it keeps the elevator there
764560	769320	You're doing this and then I want to go back to what the last place I saw John Lee Pettymore
769320	775600	Is it in the same place that the now body has reemerged resurfaced or is it in a different area now the?
776600	782800	There's not a current in here so everything that floated to the top is where it was earlier
783560	785360	Is that what you asked essentially?
785360	789680	I was wondering if the when the when the big guy got him did he swim away with him?
789760	791760	Seems like you went straight down. Okay
792480	797840	Fuck there's other people hanging in this room. Yes. Do I a recognize any of them and B
797840	803100	Can I tell if any of them are alive or actually I'm more looking for any of them that are already dead
803180	805580	There's the nearest one to you is already dead
805580	811100	The other three seem to be unconscious that you can see but one is like very clearly
811740	812940	skin
812940	820340	dilapidating to the point of the fish hook has ripped its way from the middle of the forearm all the way up to the
820340	825420	Hands and it's just hanging clearly by bones at this point
825600	830220	Yeah, I was thinking I was gonna use him to like see if there were other monsters in the water
830220	836540	But I'm nervous about time with that if John Lee Pettymore is still alive and under the surface
836540	838820	I think I'm going to have to
839580	841220	dive in
841220	844500	And look for him. Okay. How do I do that?
845820	852160	You dive in Clark takes off his contention uniform and he's in his tidy whiteies off to do so amazing
852500	856820	Alright, are you bringing anything? Are you bringing the the scythe with you? Yeah
857820	860260	Yeah, that's not gonna leave my side for as long as I can keep it
862500	865300	That's a cool weapon of destruction right there
867100	868220	All right
868220	870220	according to the rules you have
870540	875700	Con times five rounds if you take a full breath before you jump in
875980	879340	So you have a shitload of rounds? Yeah, that's a lot
879340	885680	So I am going to I also have that thing that makes it so that my con is extra high
885680	888320	Oh my gosh. Yeah, so you have plenty of time
888320	892980	Yeah, so if your search is above a 40 you'll find what you're looking for
893120	900060	But if it's not if it's a 40 or below then I'll have you roll search. So what is your search skill?
900060	905180	I don't have any in search. So I have the baseline of 20. Okay, so you'll need to roll. Okay
907600	909600	Shit
909600	911600	Oh
912160	916680	Zach you want to take a picture of this? I rolled it. I rolled a 19
920080	926780	My god, I rolled a fucking 19 on a 20. I'm like shaking
926780	928780	Hahaha
933260	940640	Joe Terry's ability to roll successes in the most dire of situations keeps me on my toes as a GM more than
941140	942920	anything else
942920	950260	More than Luke just like claiming that things exist like more than Thomas doing jokes like
950820	955780	your ability to roll successes when you have nothing in the skill is
956220	961380	Mind-blowing that that was incredible. I literally have an adrenaline surge right now
962980	966020	Joe Clark is swimming through this murkiness and
967340	969340	swimming and swimming and
969820	973800	You're trying to find anything but the water is so
974260	978660	So opaque with how dirty and disgusting it is every once in a while
978660	985020	You find these pockets of like cool water that are a little bit easier to see through but for the most part
985180	986860	it is
986860	990540	Impossible to see more than a foot in front of your face down here
990740	994380	but all of a sudden you reach out and you feel
998020	1000020	Clothes
1000380	1005420	And you feel the body of John Lee Pettymore in front of you and
1005940	1010620	Continuing to reach for it. You see he is pressed up against glass
1011220	1013720	Some sort of a wall here. What do you want to do?
1013900	1019820	You're on the other side of John Lee Pettymore from this glass as you swim up are my eyes open enough underwater that I can
1019820	1025460	See him at this point. Yes, are his eyes open or closed? He is faced away from you and he seems to be
1025980	1029620	Forcibly pushed up against this glass. Oh shit
1030140	1032140	Can I run a hand?
1032420	1034260	Kind of toward the front of him
1034260	1038100	Here's Joe's theory and probably Clark's too is that maybe he's being
1038180	1041940	Suctioned into that window because there's a hole in it and the water is trying to be rushed out
1042100	1047300	So can I feel that hole if there is one you feel all the way down? I'm gonna roll
1048100	1050100	dice I
1051980	1056140	Need you to roll stealth as I roll something else
1057820	1059820	I've got a 30 in that I
1061940	1067020	Got a 36 on a 30 so I fail I'm not gonna tell you what I rolled fuck
1068340	1070740	Fuck but I rolled dice
1073140	1078000	So, but so I just I don't feel that hole right you do not feel a hole
1078000	1081120	Okay as you run your hand, but you do feel pressure
1082740	1089420	Pulling his body up against this glass. Can I get my face closer to the glass and maybe see what's on the other side?
1089660	1094460	Yes, you can what lastly looking on the other side of the glass
1095020	1100580	You push your face up against it and open up your eyes in this disgusting water and
1101420	1103420	You see a large
1103940	1108100	office and in the middle of this office, there's a desk and
1108960	1111940	Marvin Glass is standing at this desk
1112940	1118980	Holding up a picture in his hand and he's showing it to Rosemary
1119140	1121940	who's standing on the other side of the desk and
1122540	1125060	He is like shaking it in her face and
1126300	1129620	With his other hand. He is holding it out
1130540	1135880	Toward the glass toward you toward John Lee petty more
1136580	1143300	Fuck so I'm pressed against the glass and I'm seeing that can I look like down as if I were looking down at myself and see
1143300	1147780	If there's any water coming out of where John is there's there's not right? There's not okay
1147820	1154900	I'm gonna try and pull him away from the glass and see what happens. Okay, I need you to roll strength. Okay. Okay, okay. I
1158620	1166060	Pass a 32 on a 65 as you pull at John Lee petty Moore's body you feel
1167260	1169260	Absolutely, no change
1169740	1174660	You feel it is as if you are trying to pull a statue
1175260	1179340	Away from its place on the ground or trying to pull a
1179940	1185820	Car to the side with your hands. Like it's just not gonna move not gonna budge
1187180	1193580	Fuck does Kevin John have any grenades left on him? No. Yeah, I didn't think so. I don't think I could do either
1194380	1198840	I'm afraid to ask a question because the you'll think about it. It'll be no
1199360	1204300	Can I fire my gun underwater in real life? I don't think you can I don't think so
1204540	1210020	Right. I don't think you can I think there are guns in this world that you can fire underwater
1210060	1215060	But I don't think that you're like service pistol is one of them. Fuck
1215620	1219480	Can I get a sense of how far down below the catwalks?
1219480	1225060	I have traveled to find the John Lee petty Moore's body against the glass role intelligence for me. I
1227260	1231740	Pass a 20 on a 55 like 40 meters. It's pretty deep
1234340	1240080	I want to roll first aid to see if John Lee petty Moore is actually alive or not
1240100	1243260	Okay, reach for that pulse while you roll first aid. I
1246180	1252940	Pass five on a 30 John Lee petty Moore's heart is no longer beating
1256220	1260060	He's kind of robot II though, I don't know if he needs a heart anymore I
1261060	1264460	Don't have a heart you wouldn't find a heartbeat on me and I'm dandy
1267540	1269740	And that's why you don't have to roll sanity
1272820	1277180	I'm kind of at a loss here. Here's what I think I'm gonna try because I've got such good
1277740	1281360	underwater swimming skills that I've just made up just now
1282940	1285420	Can I swim up to the top here's what I want to do
1285420	1287340	I'll tell you the whole action that I want to hit me with it
1287340	1290380	So I want to swim back up to the top jump onto the catwalk run over to
1290580	1294540	Keith's body and try and find his strong tiny powerful gun
1294540	1299020	I want to run back to the edge of the catwalk and shoot down where I last was
1299180	1304900	Trying to break the glass into into glasses office. I want to break the glass into glasses office so that it floods
1305980	1309260	Okay, give me any and all roles I need to do to make that happen
1317900	1319900	This is gonna be good
1322580	1325180	You swim back down you got that
1325900	1327060	insane
1327060	1334500	Constitution and we'll say that you you felt your way around to figure out like where you were on the catwalk
1334500	1336500	So you get up on the catwalk?
1336820	1338820	Still like empty in here
1338820	1346180	Just these unconscious and maybe dead bodies hanging in the background as you walk over to the body of Keith Vigna
1346540	1352540	Which is halfway into the elevator and the elevator door is like as you're walking up. It's like going. Yeah
1352820	1354820	It just keeps hitting
1355300	1357300	And he's losing a hit point every time
1361340	1363340	He killed John Lee Pettymore
1366020	1368740	What else can you do it sounds like Clark's winning
1369740	1371740	Clark won the game. So
1372180	1374300	This was player versus player the whole time
1375180	1377180	You guys knew that right? Yeah
1377380	1382460	So you go over and you grab this small powerful pistol off of Keith's belt
1383020	1385780	Or inside his massive cargo shorts rather
1386460	1391100	Yeah, you drop back down into the water. What are you doing?
1391100	1396860	You're diving down with this gun still in your whitey-tities drenched from head to toe walking on the catwalk
1397380	1400740	The image of this is fantastic. I love it, too
1400740	1406340	I so in my quick explanation, I said I was gonna shoot from the catwalk. Oh, I was trying on the cat
1406340	1412900	I was trying to avoid the waterlogged gun issue. Gotcha with his powerful gun to maybe help with the extra distance
1412900	1418660	Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Go ahead and roll a roll a sanity check for me
1418660	1422420	This wasn't to lose sanity. This is just to gauge a
1422780	1424780	a
1424940	1426300	Feeling oh my god
1426300	1433420	I pass a 12 on a 15 now's an interesting time to pass a sanity check when it when it doesn't matter
1434700	1436700	for losing sanity points
1437180	1444820	Yeah, you you fully you look at this gun you say no. No all guns can't fire underwater. I'm sure
1444820	1446820	And
1450620	1457180	That's gonna be a boon to you in the future so okay describe what you're doing here
1457180	1459180	I'm going back to the edge
1467980	1469980	To the wall and
1470260	1475640	The sweat is dripping down your balls as you fire making the bitches crawl
1477700	1479700	All right, so you ski ski motherfucker
1484420	1489000	And when you fire the very first time you fire you see a crack
1489860	1493740	Do you continue to fire? Yes. Yes. Yes, I do
1494620	1496620	You continue firing?
1496980	1498500	until a
1498500	1499780	leak
1499780	1506220	Begins and then all of a sudden you see the spiderweb of cracks
1507020	1510780	Grow so quickly across this entire
1511740	1516580	Wall and in one swift movement all the glass
1519940	1525380	Breaks out and all of this water starts rushing into the room
1526340	1529740	Where you saw Marvin glass and Rosemary
1532180	1540100	Fuck yeah, you're still standing on this catwalk. What do you do as the water presumably starts lowering because it's being rushed into that room
1540100	1546260	Yeah, can I see better what's happening in that room from where I am? I'm specifically looking to see if
1546820	1549000	John's body is being swept in with it
1549000	1555880	And I'm specifically looking to see where Marvin has ended up or is or is ending up or is maybe running
1555880	1563160	I don't know. That's really interesting because when you look down into this next room over as you will you see
1563960	1565960	Marvin glass and
1566120	1567480	rosemary
1567480	1569800	Marvin glass has his hands up and
1570480	1577560	His desk is still right in front of him. It's at standing height. He doesn't sit at his desk. It's a standing desk
1577560	1579400	he's trying to be healthy and
1579400	1581600	He is holding himself
1582360	1584360	the desk and
1584400	1585480	rosemary
1585480	1593440	Above the water as it's rushing in below him and as the water settles into like us one level
1593760	1598480	Covering the floor of both of these rooms these very very large rooms
1599440	1603400	He holds a hand down and then he lowers himself
1603560	1610800	And rosemary on to the top of the water and both of them are standing on the water
1611440	1614000	You do not see the body of John lee petting more
1615440	1622440	Roll stealth for me. Whoa. Whoa. Okay first roll sanity. Let's go ahead and do that. Okay
1624800	1626800	I fail the sanity a
1627440	1633440	35 on a 15. All right, you're gonna lose to sanity. All righty. I'm at 13 now
1633440	1639440	I need you what is your stealth at I'm gonna give you a negative for losing that sanity. I've got a 30 in stealth
1639440	1642360	Okay. Well, I'm giving you a negative 40. So
1642960	1644960	No need to roll here. I guess
1645240	1651840	Actually, go ahead and roll. Let's see if your dice match and if the dice match no matter what it's a critical fail
1652680	1654680	Oh boy
1654760	1656760	The dice do not match
1656920	1664320	It's a 49. It's a regular fail as Marvin glass whips his head up and makes direct eye contact
1664800	1666800	with you
1672480	1674480	I hurt my side though
1675480	1677480	my rib hit my
1677480	1679480	Oh
1679880	1685280	Something something feels bad. That's a heck of a scream. Oh god, you ruptured your appendix
1687720	1690680	Heartbreaking I need you to roll power for me
1692280	1695920	Okay, okay, it's a contest, okay
1698160	1702200	God I pass but it's really low I pass with a six
1702200	1703800	He
1703800	1708840	Actually passed with a nine nice Wow a six and a nine
1710480	1712880	You feel your entire body sees
1713440	1718600	you no longer have control and he lifts up his hand and
1718880	1723880	in one swift movement, like do you remember when you were in the
1724480	1728740	Cemetery and that creature just moved into position
1729460	1734160	You do that and all of a sudden you are standing in front of Marvin glass
1735500	1738820	You're standing on the water and you are standing on
1739660	1745220	The water I can feel my weight in my shoes and standing on it. Yes, you can. Oh my god, that's cool
1745220	1747540	I need you to roll another sanity check for me
1749740	1750900	Because
1750900	1757620	You just changed locations so quickly fail 80. Oh fuck. It's a fail above my power
1758220	1765140	85 what do you want to do here Clark as a god who is standing on water now?
1765140	1767140	Who is now standing on water?
1767820	1775160	If he's still got me held I can't do anything but that for for describing what's going on in inside Clark's head
1775160	1778300	he would we he'd be freaking the fuck out and
1778900	1780340	wanting to
1780340	1782620	Wanting to rip Marvin in the limb from limb. He would be
1783340	1789300	He would be fighting with every fiber of his body to get out of the hole that whatever Marvin has on him and
1790100	1796340	Shoving the small but powerful pistol into his fucking mouth. Yeah, it looks really sad because you can't do any of that
1796340	1802060	Yeah, we can see on your face how badly you want to so as far as these disorders go
1802060	1809540	I mean that would probably like it would be fucking up his brain from the inside. Yes, I would be I would be melting in
1809700	1813580	Inward to not be able to express what I'm feeling right now
1816100	1821100	All right, well, uh, we'll stop there for now I'm gonna go grab Luke oh shit
1831740	1835980	Luke yes, Keith Vigno is unconscious. Yeah, I
1836580	1838580	I just saw some stuff
1841220	1848020	Luke Keith Vigna's eyes open and they're staring into black darkness
1849060	1851060	just pure obsidian
1852060	1854740	Reflection looking back down at you
1855380	1859020	And you notice that you have been jammed
1859800	1864260	halfway into this elevator and the elevators doors are
1865100	1869860	Closing on you just like close open close open close
1870820	1875920	Open and you feel on your chest where you got just shredded
1876560	1878180	earlier
1878180	1882860	You feel a bit of walking around and you hear
1884020	1887980	Hey friend, I'm almost done. I'm almost done taking care of you
1887980	1894260	Are you gonna I hope that you're feeling better and you gain four hit points? Oh, yeah
1894260	1899380	I think you were at two hit points when you went is right. So you're up to six hit points now and
1900060	1907580	looking down you see that Peter Dieter is spitting his like weird saliva all over you and then like
1907860	1912500	Using his little human hands to like close up your wounds
1913140	1914860	basically a tear
1914860	1921660	Falls down what my right eye and I just say you don't know how good it is to see you
1921660	1926700	I never thought I'd see you again. I'm glad I could I'm glad I could save you my friend
1926700	1930260	It's really it's really nice to see a friend again. I was inside of
1931420	1938160	Darkness for a long time and it was really gross in there and I just I hated it. There were all these
1938920	1944680	Are these bad friends, you know, yeah, they kept coming in and they were all very
1945440	1952320	Very standoffish. How did you get out? I swam there was a there's a lot of water rushing
1952320	1954320	And I just went with the current
1954520	1955000	Okay
1955000	1955400	Yeah
1955400	1961080	As you as you look down you actually see the water in this room
1961160	1965480	This room that you've just been trapped in for some time. The water is
1966040	1969160	Much lower than it was before like
1970160	1977600	40 meters lower. Okay than it was before and looking down you see the wall on the right side is gone
1977880	1984120	Which is where you think that aquarium class was so it appears to have been
1984640	1990400	Probably broken it appears to have probably been broken are my eyes adjusting at all
1990400	1991640	Is it getting a little less?
1991680	1995700	Can I see a little better in here you can see a little bit better as you're coming to
1995960	2004420	Consciousness and looking down you see that there was a room next to this room at a lower point and it is
2005280	2006620	Marvin Glasses office
2006620	2010520	but the floor is made entirely of water and
2010840	2017120	Marvin Glass is standing on this water behind his platform podium like desk and
2018080	2020080	across from him is
2020640	2022240	Clark Bishop and
2022240	2028760	Rose Mary do they see me I need you to roll stealth. What's Keith victim percent ten percent?
2029600	2031600	Not a sneaky guy
2032320	2039880	89 all right, would you like to spend 79 luck to make that a success? No, I can't and I wouldn't anyway
2039880	2041880	All right with that
2042880	2045960	Marvin Glass looks up at you. He is
2046720	2052680	150 200 yards away, but you feel it when you look down you feel his eyes
2053240	2055240	staring into you I want to
2055960	2058020	crab walk backwards into the
2058740	2061980	Into the elevator. I should roll power for me
2065320	2069560	18 on a 50 I rolled a six
2069560	2072660	Wait, it means you win. Yay
2076200	2082800	All right, so what that means is as you back away you see in front of you Peter Deeter is
2083320	2091280	Lifted off of you and goes flying down below as you scurry back into the elevator and the door closes
2091280	2097160	Oh, I needed him roll sanity. I know you don't have empathy. No technically I
2098120	2101680	Mean you do Luke feels bad, right?
2101680	2106600	But Peter Deeter, I think Keith feels bad because Peter could have helped him
2106600	2111880	But not I don't feel bad for not an emotional way, right? No, it's because you needed a
2112400	2116240	Compatriot on you. I needed help. I didn't care about him necessarily. Yeah
2118120	2125120	The door closes and you were in this elevator is there lighter is it also like just pitch black no, there's light in here
2125120	2129600	It's as you've been in this elevator before and it looks very similar except for now
2129600	2134600	It is wet because you are soaking wet and it is covered in your blood
2134600	2141600	Yeah, so with his spit and whatnot has it patched up a little bit of the bleeding. Yes, it has. Okay, cool. I
2142200	2145720	Stand up. Is there any thing else in here with me or is it just me?
2145720	2152120	It is just you and the elevator begins moving backwards and then up and then across
2152160	2156960	And then up like that Roald Dahl book just like that
2157280	2161880	These schnoz berries don't taste anything like schnoz berries. Yeah
2164780	2165960	So
2165960	2167960	the elevator door opens
2169040	2171040	into a lab and
2171320	2173320	Looking around you can see these
2173640	2180920	These clear dividing walls all over the place are covered in like Expo marker with all this crazy math
2180920	2186400	All over this is not the one that I the lab that I came out of recently. No, it is not
2186840	2191680	however, you see a familiar face inside this lab that is full of
2192440	2194640	computers and magnets and all these
2195300	2202720	electrical shit and there's a panel of television screens and there's a window into another room like a
2202840	2209940	Like almost like an interrogation room like in the police station, but the room that's inside is completely covered in blood
2210920	2214320	And the person that you see in this room is
2215160	2216960	the scientist
2216960	2222240	Dressed in the scientist lady. Yeah. Yeah, and she's dressed in this white lab coat
2222240	2226220	And she's got the goggles and the hair going all crazy to top her head
2227080	2232180	She's walking around and she looks up. She sees you she sees your hurt. She's like
2234000	2239720	Well, what are you doing around here hey, I need your help with something you're Keith, right?
2239880	2241880	We just fixed you up
2241960	2247760	Yeah, I was sent on a mission by by Marvin and well, I came back to report to him what happened
2247760	2252840	But I got in a little trouble. Oh, I don't I walk into the room
2252920	2259300	I'm looking for my little fish friend. He was in that room where we fixed you up earlier
2259320	2262600	He was in there, but oh, yeah, but he's not there now
2262600	2269420	So I'm looking for him here in Francis's lab. Have you seen him cute little fella?
2270000	2271280	well
2271280	2273280	the mission Marvin sent me on
2273720	2278480	Right before he did it. He uh, I think he tried to kill that little fish guy
2278480	2281480	He sent him into the big aquarium down there. He
2282080	2285720	somehow he put his fist through the glass and just let him go and
2287480	2288800	There was some
2288800	2295960	Much bigger fish in there that I don't know if he he would have made it or not. The scientists face just melts
2296560	2298560	into the sad
2299360	2301280	Placidity oh
2301280	2306760	Okay, they make sense, but I don't know for sure. I didn't see him get eaten or anything
2306760	2312320	He might still be swimming around in there. He might have escaped. I don't know. Can I do a human on her? Sure
2312320	2317240	Yeah, I want to see if she's somebody that I can like trust to
2317800	2319800	Information that I know, okay
2320000	2323080	64 and an 80. All right. Yeah, she is
2323280	2328040	She's really hurt by this to the point to where this is like crushing information
2328080	2330200	I thought maybe you wanted to hurt him or something
2330200	2336400	But I just got hurt up in a I was in a room over the over the water
2336640	2339840	The aquarium or whatever is and yeah of the torch
2339840	2344880	Yeah, I was in the torture chamber and I've gotten to a little skiff and I was hurt
2344880	2346880	I was I got knocked out and I was a plea and
2347360	2354040	With one of them prisoners. No one of the one of those fish men. I don't know why they were attacking me, but they did
2355040	2361400	No, no, no, well, there's no way my boys would ever do well and I just show her
2361400	2366360	you know the wounds that I have I'm like one of them did this and well
2367120	2372120	Your little fish friend. I'm a nicknamed him Peter. I woke up to him
2372720	2377600	Helping me out. I was about to die I think and he he healed me up real good
2377600	2381240	But right before I got in the elevator, he got somehow got thrown off
2381520	2384400	He might have got thrown down with Marvin Oh
2385080	2386360	where
2386360	2392440	Wait, how did he get to Marvin's office? There's not an entrance that well I saw him
2392440	2394480	There's a lot less water in that aquarium
2394480	2399400	now when I when I got knocked out it was almost up to where I was in the catwalk and
2399720	2404760	Now there it's about you know hundreds of feet lower than it is now Oh
2405600	2407600	Hundreds of well eat I
2407920	2411560	Don't know. I was dark in there. It was a lot less water down in there
2411560	2418800	I could see it was Marvin standing with a couple other people. Oh the the water flooded Marvin's office
2418800	2422600	I guess if that's where Marvin hangs out at that's all I that's all I saw
2422600	2428640	But was it if you think that he might be in the right when you walked in? Yeah. Oh, no
2429200	2435080	I gotta get down there then. Oh, well, can I come with you? I saw I think I might have seen a I
2436680	2441480	Don't know it's a if it's a friend or an enemy, but somebody that I recognize too. Yeah, I
2442380	2448340	Absolutely. Let's go down there. Do you want to do anything before you leave? I would like to search the room. Yeah. All right
2449600	2451600	Go ahead and roll search for me
2451600	2453600	Oh
2454240	2459480	38 on a 40 awesome. So as you're explaining all this and you guys are having this conversation
2459880	2462280	you're looking around this room and
2463000	2465880	Noting everything that is around you find all these
2466240	2471880	VHS tapes lined up right next to the panel of screens next to a VHS player and
2472900	2480040	you can see that this is footage you're guessing from the room that is covered in blood and
2481640	2487840	When you're looking around at the math that it's all over these boards you would notice that is Francis's handwriting
2488020	2491040	Hey before we leave what what went on in that room? Oh
2492160	2499000	Yeah, and now this is where what Francis's job. I'll just tell you later. I want to
2499560	2506120	Swipe one of the VHS tapes and put it. Oh, I can show you that later if you want
2506400	2511400	You probably shouldn't take it with you I guess we could pop it in right now if you're there
2511400	2514240	I would like to see it with my own eyes. Oh
2515000	2520520	Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be far better. Just seeing your face. Watch this
2522200	2526200	So you put in this VHS tape and it's static on the
2526520	2534000	screens in front of you and then you see it's security footage from the corner of this room and it's covered in blood and
2534960	2537460	In the room there's a desk a
2538240	2542920	Table and behind the table. There's a person standing and it's a
2543480	2548800	it's a young man, and he is rail thin absolutely malnourished and
2549760	2552660	Does it remind me of like a one of the cage fighting kids?
2553160	2560600	Absolutely reminds you of one of the cage fighting kids and this kid reaches out in front and in front of him on the desk
2560760	2563480	There is a small metal sphere
2564120	2566120	and when
2566400	2569940	He reaches out and grabs onto the sphere
2570840	2572840	You see immediately
2573200	2578320	multiple shiny limbs extend from this small metal sphere and
2579120	2582080	Slam into the walls on either side
2582800	2588320	giving it the leverage it needs to fling itself out of the hand of this young boy and
2588720	2590720	up on top
2591240	2597880	One of its appendages slices into the soft tissue on the back of his neck and another snaps his head forward
2598560	2603440	You can see a fracture as the third metal tendril reaches in
2603960	2606440	Gripping the top of this young boy's spine
2606920	2610920	Where it meets his head and it rips his entire
2611200	2617120	Spinal cord out of his body in one swift motion and then it forces itself
2617840	2619880	into the hole that it made
2620720	2622120	and then all of a sudden
2622120	2627160	The boy just starts running and slamming his head into the wall
2627720	2632680	Repeatedly until he falls to the ground bleeding all over the room
2637680	2644840	The scientist is laughing as she's watching you watch this. I need you to roll sanity for me. I don't think so
2645320	2651520	Yeah, maybe the sanity is going to be for the the science fiction nature of right
2651520	2655080	You just saw I don't I mine is really low
2655900	2659060	Yeah, I rolled a 43 on 8 so alright
2659240	2665620	You are going to lose to sanity taking you down to 6 sanity. Hold on
2665620	2672200	So I got to my breaking point the last time that's why oh wait, that's why you have the way I have that
2672240	2677240	I don't think I ever changed what my next breaking point was. You don't have one. I'm joking
2677240	2682680	Yeah, your next your next breaking point will be zero in which case you lose your mind completely
2683760	2685240	Cool, cool
2685240	2687480	That'll be fun. Yeah, super fun
2688520	2694640	So I think Keith, you know not too much bothered by the violent aspect of it
2694640	2699480	But seeing that metal ball turn into some sort of weird
2700080	2703160	Silver monster thing and seeing that happen and
2703680	2709420	I asked her I'm like, is this what is on all of these videotapes? Oh, yeah
2709560	2712720	We're trying to figure out what's the deal with the metal balls?
2712840	2720200	Is that so every time you is any time somebody touches one of those metal balls that happens but she nods her head and her hair
2720400	2722400	Frantically fucks the top. I've
2722640	2729340	I've seen one of these before and I've seen somebody touch it and that doesn't happen you did what now you saw what?
2729480	2733400	I've seen one of those before and well who had it? Where was it from?
2734280	2738760	We can get into it later after we go rescue your fish friend. Let's talk while we walk
2738760	2745600	All right. Okay, you guys start talking and walking. So you tell me you saw one in Spears. We found it in a
2746200	2749640	Fucked up head of a body which makes me
2750800	2754340	Keith in his mind is like oh fuck, you know like
2755200	2758140	yeah, we got it out and we handled it and
2758900	2760740	Nothing happened to it. Oh
2760740	2768060	You touched the ball. No, I didn't but who do you well one of my fellow officers?
2769220	2775480	Went back before all this shit went down. I was a police officer. I probably yeah, I'm not anymore
2775480	2777480	I don't I don't guess but
2778260	2783540	yeah, he had it on him and he touched it we had another one too and
2784380	2786380	we had a
2786380	2789180	Well, this might be too much information, but fuck it
2789700	2796420	Been a weird weird week. We have a bag that if you put these these silver balls in there, they disappear
2796420	2802780	They do what now they disappear you put it in the bag and then there's nothing in it after that is
2804200	2809040	Remarkable and it doesn't make sense. Where do you find these they're
2810000	2817640	Let's go ahead and just and that elevator door that you're in opens up and you are looking at the hallway that leads to
2818040	2820240	Marvin Glasses office and
2821120	2823120	You walk down to the end of the hallway
2823760	2827400	there's a 10 by 10 slab of black marble an
2828160	2833560	enormous and strange door that slowly slides open as you approach and
2834200	2840240	As it slides open Keith gets a weird shiver down his neck because he remembers the last time he was here you
2840680	2846080	Remember looking down at this room earlier and she says wait a second
2846080	2849800	There was water and as she's saying that water just starts
2850680	2857880	Exploding out of this door and begins filling up the hallway that you were in needed a role in athletics check to swim
2857880	2859880	Oh
2864480	2866480	All right
2878560	2880560	Joe Clark Bishop is
2881040	2885700	standing in front of Marvin Glass unable to move and the first thing that he says is
2888200	2895280	Visitors and then he holds up his hand and he pulls up out of the water below you
2895800	2897800	Keith Vigna and
2897900	2904280	The scientist the woman in the white lab coat and the goggles and the foppish hair
2904280	2909540	That's the classic mad scientist the classic mad scientist and they both immediately
2910200	2917320	Come out of the water. They're drenched and then all of a sudden they're both standing there next to you as well when you both
2917880	2922560	Look around you see on this desk on this like platform
2923280	2925280	Desk in front of you
2925320	2927320	He has sitting
2927320	2929320	the very strange camera
2929320	2931320	the very strange gun and
2932520	2934520	a silver sphere
2934960	2937040	that is on a little platform and
2938000	2940000	in his hand
2940040	2947320	It's a picture and you recognize it as one of the Polaroid pictures that would come out of this strange camera
2947360	2950240	and he holds it up to the two of you and
2950880	2955640	Looking at this picture you see in this darkness
2955840	2961340	This world of darkness that you've seen before with the ground made of light coming up
2962520	2964520	you see
2965640	2972680	John Lee Pettymore in the body of Kevin Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop and he says
2973080	2974480	Tell me
2974480	2976960	What you know about this?
2978320	2980320	I
2983520	2986840	Keith literally does what I just did and his
2987680	2994080	Mouth agape jaw dropped the same. I can't I don't like
3007320	3009320	Oh
3014000	3016000	Try
3021640	3023640	Try
3037320	3039320	You
