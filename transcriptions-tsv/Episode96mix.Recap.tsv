14040	18440	contentions most coherent and easy to follow radio station
18580	24540	But on the off chance you disagree with that objective sentiment. We're dropping a very special
25320	32520	Recapulation of the entire situation going down here in contention seems like a good time for it
32520	35160	You know your Wolfie might take a couple notes
35320	42760	Even though I am a all-seeing all-knowing being and all that this week's howling with wolf is from Sinbad

74560	80440	And look I've dealt with the phenomena. It's a real phenomena. They see this a movie Shazam that I never did
80440	83880	But they didn't do a can we do a part two who knows they might put me in that one
83880	86780	So you never know, but uh, no, I never did Shazam
87440	93120	Never I just read the comic books and watched the TV show when I was a kid coming up. So, uh,
93680	96360	I'm the height. I don't know what kind of Mandela effect you going through

252800	256920	Unseasonably warm December 1st in a small town called
257840	263760	Contention a thin mist could be seen under the streetlights on an empty
264280	267880	Country road the inside of the contention police department
267880	273960	However was cozy warm and bright at the front desk every morning and every evening
274640	281920	Drew Andrews sat determined small teeth and big gums showing answering the phone and taking messages
282000	285760	in the bullpen sat our three PCs or
286640	292600	Protagonist cops though neither of those words seemed to factually describe these player characters
292960	299380	Clark Bishop was the oldest by the book officer dead set on doing his best in this dead-end job
299940	303220	Still living in the house. His parents left him when they died
303760	308060	He had never cooked and he watched Wheel of Fortune every night
308460	310900	Keith Vigna was raised just outside
311420	316660	Contention but soon moved to the city where he trained to become a police officer
317140	323540	His stint in the city was short-lived. He's not a bad cop. He's just a bad cop
324180	326540	His pants are too big
327280	333140	John Lee petty more the fourth was one of the few petty Moore's to stay on the right side of the law or at least
333180	339380	The petty Moore version of that his mustache tight pants substance abuse issues and
339820	346500	Inability to keep bullets in his clip aligned perfectly with both his family values and love of
346900	350620	Smokey and the bandit on this evening December 1st
351080	357260	Drew Andrews top lip receding gums akimbo received a bevy of calls complaints
357700	362340	Regarding the abundance of howling coming from the dogs in the old neighborhood
362660	368660	This neighborhood west of downtown was home to John Peters Mildred Mitchell Tildi B
368660	374500	Mitchell councilwoman Carrie pages and the boss of the contention police department chief
374780	382700	Maggie cook and it just so happened that December 1st this night when everything began was the Chiefs birthday
383240	385880	Drew presented chief cook with a yellow journal
386620	390820	Noting she already had this same notebook in both red and blue
391420	396700	Clark got her the same thing. He got her the year before and every year before that
396700	399860	He's been on the force a box of chocolates
400300	404020	John pulled a bottle of cheap bourbon from his desk
404180	411400	It was open and a third of it was gone, but he tried Keith panicked. He didn't realize it was the Chiefs birthday
411900	417500	However, there was a mysterious package wrapped nicely sitting on Drew's desk
418060	420060	Keith claimed it as his gift
420140	424260	But when Maggie cook opened this present and saw its contents
424260	431100	She began weeping walked into her office and slammed the door leaving Clark drew and John
431780	435860	staring and bewilderment at the new kid in town Keith vigna
436300	442540	chief Maggie cook distraught and determined left the contention police station without saying a word and
442820	450940	The box were three items a single red rose a white hardhat and a black silk bowtie
452060	459180	Before they could react drew Andrews received the phone call that set all of the preceding events in motion
460000	465620	Julie Maxwell reported a dead body at the piston junkyard the chief list
465980	469700	CPD headed out to investigate the scene on the way there
469700	475240	They spotted Julie Maxwell driving chaotically and well above the speed limit back toward town
475540	482940	John Lee Pettymore the fourth peeled off to pull her over just in time to see her near fatal car accident
483180	486820	She was thrown clear of the vehicle face smashed
487340	489340	crying out into the night
489540	493600	John called an ambulance and investigated the crash in her car
493600	499200	He found an open bottle of brandy gas cans lighters an unusual
499480	506360	Camera with strange glass tubes a red light lit and a green light unlit as well as a Polaroid
506720	513320	That showed the base of a tall building and a group crowding the entrance with fists raised
514400	522480	Everything in this picture was lit by torches and some of the people's hands in the building was a slightly shiny pitch black
522880	528200	Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop carried on to the piston junkyard where they found a body
528920	531740	splattered on the ground face first face
532260	539760	Smashed the body was wearing thick hand-stitched clothing and leather boots a small note in the pocket read
540240	543600	We is striking when the land gets darkness
544440	546320	readying torches
546320	547720	Hesitate not
547720	555560	Most peculiar however was the skin on this body's back a fresh wound. It was branded with the words
556240	558240	This is a fool
558480	564920	This corpse was determined to be a woman and the officers called in their fourth musketeer the only other
565320	567460	contention police officer Ray
568040	571080	To take the corpse over to County for testing
571440	575500	They also called the city hospital to check on Julie Maxwell's condition
575620	577620	She had been declared deceased
578300	582580	after some light discussion of smashed faces and blunt force trauma
583500	587680	Clark Bishop headed home to his TV dinner and Wheel of Fortune
588240	593940	Keith Vigna went back to his temporary home hotel motel where his golden retriever bean
594260	602100	Waited patiently and John Lee Pettymore the fourth shot some pool by himself at clinkers the local watering hole and daycare
602780	607940	The next day on December 2nd three assignments awaited the three officers
608500	612620	Councilwoman Carrie pages dog was missing and she was distraught
612660	619220	The councilwoman suggested Tyler may have been eaten by a person as contention had just seen a rise in
619820	624020	Homelessness Clark printed posters and walk the neighborhood all to no avail
624700	632440	Jimmy Sanders an uncle of sorts to John Lee Pettymore called in an oil spill across a country road in the southeast
632460	634460	Sometime around 4 a.m
634620	641820	John checked it out found no oil spill and Jimmy admitted he was tripping on mushrooms during the incident
642140	643420	Mildred Mitchell
643420	645700	contentions kooky pothead grandma
646060	651860	Wanted someone to know her neighbor's door was open and this neighbor this John Peters
652100	654100	Hadn't been around in a few days
654380	661780	Keith found out she saw a bright flash of light from Peters's place a few nights previous and he's been missing ever since
662460	668260	He checked it out and found John's mail overflowing his car in the driveway and his front door
668340	675420	Smashed into the drywall in the house were broken pictures and clear signs that John was a heavy drinker
675500	678140	There was also a trunk in the living room
678620	681440	Burned into the top of this trunk were the words
681980	689100	Do not open if you want to live the trunk was empty save some foam padding that held four
689500	693380	specifically shaped items one large to medium and one small
694060	700020	There were betting stubs on John's nightstand. He bet on long shots and mostly lost
700500	707540	John's keychain had his house keys a bottle opener his car keys a few small keys that said
707660	708660	G10
708660	714340	G11 and G12 and a key fob for a rewards program at dirty dog
714580	717380	grooming a pet salon franchise in the city
717620	721060	However, John didn't seem to have a dog
721580	728820	According to Drew Andrews John Peters wasn't very interesting though. He did have a long stay in the hospital a couple years ago
729700	735980	After meeting back up the three officers decided to look further into John Peters starting again at his home
736260	743140	When they arrived his car was no longer in the driveway and the empty trunk was missing from inside the residence
743780	749800	Mildred Mitchell came by to let them know two people came packed up the trunk into their white Toyota and took off
749900	753640	One in their car and the other in John Peters maroon vehicle
754060	760100	The officers headed to chief Maggie cooks house next her cruiser wasn't there. She wasn't there
760100	761340	They hit up clinkers
761340	767620	The only information from Harry clinker was that Keith liked to cut up hot dogs on white bread when he was a kid
768420	769900	continuing this tour of
769900	777340	Contention the cops went out to harass Leo piston the owner of the piston junkyard who had a restraining order placed against him by
777340	783460	Julie Maxwell 15 years before after Leo was accused of killing Julie's sister Ashley
784060	788780	Clark set up a meeting with Leo and George the piston brothers for the following day
788900	794480	Keith stayed behind to keep a hidden eye on the piston pig farm back at the police station
795060	799860	John found the Chiefs blue notebook full of work appointments and notes
799860	803940	But her red notebook and the newly gifted yellow notebook weren't in her office
804180	811100	That's about the time when contention received a chilling phone call the city hospital had fucked up
811540	816100	They heard screaming from inside a drawer in the morgue
816700	823020	Julie Maxwell was alive. John Lee pettymore took off for the city hospital to get some answers
824660	829460	Clark came into the office to an equally confusing message from County
830040	836140	Apparently that body from the junkyard had the organs of someone who died 200 years ago
836140	839420	But the skin and hair of someone who died yesterday
840260	848140	Then Charles a drunk man and friend of the missing John Peters came to the station to figure out what was going on
848980	854260	Before pulling a gun and running away upon hearing the sound of a car crash in the parking lot
854620	861680	Out of the piston pig farm Kathy piston shot the encroaching and trespassing Keith vigna in the foot
862360	863120	Recognizing him though
863120	869440	She bandaged his wound and offered her apologies for the incident after Keith claimed to have a warrant
869440	872880	She offered him coffee Keith snooped around her property
873280	880880	Failing to find anything of interest until he eventually stowed away on Kathy piston school bus full of homeless people
881660	889320	Afraid of being caught though. He bailed out of the emergency hatch in the back further hurting his shot and bandaged foot in
890320	897600	In the parking lot of the city hospital a creepy figure obscured by a black cloak and hood
898160	905180	Approached John Lee pettymore the fourth this mysterious man handed John a note written in binary and croaked
905320	907320	Say hello to me
908520	914180	Before softly cackling and disappearing into the rows of parked cars
914940	921140	John texted drew a picture of the binary note to translate and he radioed the only other
921580	928420	Contention police officer Tim to do a search for storage facilities and contention with G units
928800	935820	John didn't find Julie Maxwell at the hospital because she dipped stole a black SUV and made a beeline for contention
935820	943640	This was of course the same black SUV that just t-boned George Pistons truck in the parking lot of the contention
944000	948420	police station now helmed at gunpoint by a kidnapped Leo
948920	955920	Piston the three officers pursued Julie Maxwell and Leo piston in the stolen black SUV out to splashylvania
956440	963200	The abandoned vampire themed waterpark Ashley Maxwell was heading to 15 years ago when her life ended
964040	970380	Bishop pettymore and hobbling vigna found their targets at the top of the two-fanged plunge
971300	976300	Maxwell with a pistol to the back of the kneeling Leo pistons torso
976380	978460	She cried out into the night
983460	989580	Except for the black shiny devil and the underground temple from which it shall rise
990100	996080	But if there's a tiny chance that justice matters, then my sister deserves this
997000	999000	To bleed out and die
999680	1002880	With that she fired a shot through Leo's body
1003480	1010560	Clark immediately pulled his pistol and put a bullet through one of Julie Maxwell's eyes the two limp
1010800	1015000	bodies slid slowly down the two opposing slides
1015300	1021920	Wet for the first time in a decade and a half with the blood of these opposing contention residents
1022440	1024440	But at the bottom of the ride
1025220	1027480	Something incomprehensible happened
1028040	1035420	the bodies of Julie Maxwell and Leo piston were picked up and slammed into the ground repeatedly and at an
1035480	1041320	Absurd rate by some unseen force and then as if they were never there at all
1041920	1043920	Both bodies were gone
1044760	1046400	Keith saw
1046400	1051800	Covering the ground where the two bodies just were a black shiny viscous sludge
1052200	1059520	Seemingly inside this muck were the thrashing bodies of Julie Maxwell and Leo piston their hands reached out
1059720	1065600	Trying to escape this thing that had them trapped with their limbs soon seemed to fold
1066000	1073480	Into this ooze becoming one with the sentient mass of goop that began sliding across the ground toward Keith who?
1073600	1076400	Promptly Wile E. Coyote the fuck out of there
1077280	1082400	Back in the splashylvania parking lot the strange camera's green light was lit
1082880	1088980	John took a picture causing a blindingly bright flash of light and he instantly saw black
1089400	1094480	Viscous goo dripping from the camera all over his hands, and then it was gone
1095000	1101560	The picture was of a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose
1101880	1108320	He was bent over head and hands and stocks made of a shiny black material and the word
1108800	1112520	Fool was branded into his forehead
1113600	1118460	Clark recognized this man as they're missing John Peters
1119920	1126360	Drew Andrews texted John back with the translation of the mysterious man's binary message it read
1126360	1128720	I killed the Chiefs pops John
1129720	1134120	Before they called it a day Keith went to the clinic and acquired a wheelchair
1134600	1139640	That night these three contentioned police officers had some strange dreams
1144600	1146600	John Lee petty more the fourth
1146800	1153640	You're reliving the moment when you saw the black sludge on your hands and dripping from the odd camera and picture
1153880	1161400	Your perception changes and you're out of your body looking at yourself staring intently at your own hands
1162220	1169000	You see there's the same viscous muck dripping from your eyes and nostrils
1169240	1171240	As you wake up in bed
1172400	1176460	Keith vigna, you see a woman standing before you in your bedroom
1177120	1182220	She's wearing old-timey clothing and she stares angrily at you
1182300	1187980	She lunges toward you picking you up and throwing you into the ground and you fall
1188220	1192080	Into the floor of your bedroom and then wake up in bed
1192780	1194200	Clark Bishop
1194200	1196200	You see a man underneath you
1196920	1204660	Struggling to breathe as you tighten your grip around his neck you look up after the life leaves his eyes
1205220	1211960	And see an empty dark alleyway as you wake up on the couch with infomercials playing on your TV
1212920	1214780	The next day was December 3rd
1214780	1222260	The officers broke into g10 g11 and g12 John Peters storage units at a plus storage
1223140	1230440	G10 was filled with crates stacked three high each crate was wooden and stamped US military on the side
1231220	1235020	Inside these crates were guns ammunition and heavy weaponry
1235140	1238860	This included pistols shotguns rifles a shoulder-mounted
1239740	1245460	anti-aircraft weapon an EMP rifle a grappling gun a small gun that shoots tracers
1245660	1251660	Lots of grenades a sniper rifle a very tiny but very powerful gun and a drone
1251920	1255980	There was also a pallet on which was sitting a large cube-shaped
1256580	1261020	Object covered in so much plastic wrap that its contents were obfuscated
1261340	1267180	The large cube-shaped object was in fact bricks upon bricks of cocaine
1268140	1269460	precisely
1269460	1274840	479 bricks of cocaine worth around 12 million dollars John took a brick
1275380	1279460	Immediately inside g11 was a burlap sack containing
1280580	1286640	$50,000 in shredded blue dye stained banknotes a piece of notebook paper with poorly drawn
1286860	1289400	diagrams and nearly illegible writing
1290240	1293720	225 pound bags of potatoes a ziplock bag
1294120	1300600	containing five bulbs of garlic a garlic crusher an empty test tube and a syringe a small
1300960	1304240	drawstring Nike bag a 3 million candlepower
1304840	1309260	handheld spotlight a well-filled toolbox a black leather backpack
1309840	1317040	containing a set of lock picks wire cutters wire strippers a crimping tool flat and Phillips head screwdrivers and a
1317040	1324640	lockout tool a bottle of caffeine pills a carton of cigarettes three shovels a small digital scale a syringe labeled morphine a
1324680	1329120	handful of ski masks walkie-talkies and a burned CD labeled
1329640	1331640	monster mash mash
1332480	1336600	Inside g12 was a four-wheeler with dried dirt and clay
1337000	1344080	Caked all over the thing as well as a couple of plastic trunks near the door was a small chunk of paper that had been
1344200	1350480	Folded into the size of a business card against the back wall was a small table with some more papers on it
1350600	1357680	The small chunk of paper on the floor was a bedding guide and inside were some more ripped up bedding stubs
1358240	1360240	someone lost
1360640	1366720	$5,000 on October 31st the three names to bet on were Oz mayhem wolf miles
1367120	1372500	Detonator Carver and Carl blitzkrieg Anderson at the bottom it said
1373020	1376000	Tonight versus planet juggernaut
1376460	1384540	The stubs were all losers a five-to-one bet then a six-to-one bet then finally a thirty-to-one bet
1384900	1391620	Inside one of the trunks was a box of assorted batteries spools of electrical wiring three
1392060	1398020	disassembled handguns and an impossibly clean machete sitting atop three full suits
1398500	1404460	Including shirt tie and shoes all covered in dirt clay and black stains
1404740	1410540	That look to be blood there was a note handwritten on a scrap piece of paper that read
1411020	1417380	The cabin is in the woods stark west from the end of the trail about 2.5 miles
1418260	1422260	Dash-k we took care of nine of them as well as the leader
1422580	1426060	There was also a sheet that seemed to be ripped out of a notebook
1426260	1429700	It was handwritten as well, but in different handwriting and it said
1430380	1435440	The work is difficult in particular, but I've had 12 successes
1436140	1441580	Life isn't as complex as they believe they are quite simple
1441580	1449660	It will be their downfall and the last piece of paper was a cutout from the contention Chronicle from 25 years ago an
1449740	1455100	ad that read Kohl's orphanage new school under modern etiquette
1455260	1459220	We are here to serve the beautiful community of contention
1459780	1465260	None of the rogue police officers remembered the name of that orphanage though. The coal name was familiar
1466220	1472340	Silas Cole was one of the founders of this town and he was the owner of the mine for a couple of years
1472540	1477540	His wife Mary Cole did a lot of good in the town and the library was named after her
1477540	1483000	The school was called Silas Cole K through 12 and there was a Cole's Creek as well as the three
1483200	1490720	Approached the other plastic trunk in g12 this one with the lid fastened. The stench was nearly
1491320	1497500	Unbearable it was decided they would wait to open this trunk back at the office after having a u-haul delivered
1497840	1505000	Pettimore Bishop and vigna packed up everything contained in these storage units and brought it all back to the police station
1505840	1509640	the awfully pungent trunk was clear and
1510000	1517520	Before opening the lid they could only see a dried black crust which was painted on every bit of the trunk sides
1517920	1525840	When they opened it the rancid smell of old metal hit their nostrils and atop this pile of what looked like a messily
1525840	1527840	chopped up human body
1528400	1534680	Sat a woman's head split down the middle and pulled apart with a small silver sphere
1534800	1542040	Sitting in between the two halves Keith took a picture John pocketed this small silver sphere
1543840	1548920	Before heading out to the woods drew was tasked with looking into finding information about Cole's
1549120	1555760	Orphanage and also finding someone who could understand the machinery in the diagram out in the woods the contention
1555760	1559200	Police officers found a patch of land that had been burned to the ground
1560040	1567120	Realized they were being watched freaked out wrecked the four-wheeler ran into trees and overall just super fucked up
1567320	1574520	Topped off by Clark flying a drone into himself after their failed nature excursion
1574520	1580940	They went to Julie Maxwell's wore her taxidermy and found a circled the yellow pages ad for dr
1580940	1586260	Marie Jacobs as well as a receipt from Forgotten Treasures a local flea market
1586860	1593300	Aftergotten Treasures they learned that the camera Julie Maxwell purchased was from Mildred Mitchell's booth
1593460	1597820	But Mildred was unaware of any items recently sold at her booth
1597900	1603060	She told the boys it must have been her granddaughter till DB who came downstairs at that exact moment
1603180	1607600	But the sight of cops spooked her and she bolted back upstairs and into her room
1607700	1611660	When Clark busted until DB Mitchell had a crazed look in her eyes
1611780	1617500	She slammed a large bullet into the chamber and squeezed the trigger on this odd-looking
1618420	1621960	Revolver there was an almost blinding flash of light
1622340	1627540	Illuminating everything and then as if she had never been there the girl was gone
1628380	1632420	Clark just saw an odd gun fall to the floor confused
1632420	1637620	He checked the closet and under the bed for the missing girl unsurprisingly with no luck
1638540	1640540	The very anti
1640540	1645980	antiheroes of this story then went to Forgotten Treasures to ask more questions and they
1646140	1653300	Eventually bullied the nice lady there until she put her own life in danger by telling these cops about the drunk man who threatened her
1653780	1659700	They left after they got what they wanted and the white Toyota they had been searching for was right outside
1659940	1667600	It peeled out onto the road after a short dangerous pursuit. The white Toyota was bested tireless and boxed in
1667820	1673100	Bullets were whizzing past him. So Keith Vigna attempted to fire a warning shot with his shotgun
1673740	1678420	However, this warning shot promptly killed the driver Charles Donovan
1678580	1686320	John Lee Pettymore fired shots into the air to disperse the growing crowd and a few stray bullets also hit Clark's tires
1687140	1692580	Inside the white Toyota they found two guns a wallet with ID for Billy Harrison a
1693020	1698180	Rifle and keys with a Dodge logo on the deceased man's person
1698180	1705020	They found ID from the city for Charles Donovan and a piece of paper with the addresses of both
1705100	1708260	John Peters's house and the piston pig farm
1708580	1715460	The keys in the ignition included a key to a room at Hotel Motel and a key fob for the rewards
1715580	1722380	Program at dirty dog grooming the dead driver's body had scratches all over the arm's hand
1722780	1725900	Legs and face they were not claw marks
1725900	1734020	They were not from brush John recognized these scratches as the pattern of human hands and the trunk was a
1734300	1738900	Tied-up and unconscious man who matched the picture in the ID for Billy Harrison
1739800	1744740	Additionally, there was a police uniform a set of scrubs in a black suit in these clothes
1744740	1747860	They found a contention badge for an officer
1748340	1751900	Kissel an ID in the scrubs that said dr
1751900	1758840	Zebrowski and inside a pocket of the black suit or FBI credentials for an agent parks
1759300	1763940	They called an ambulance and Keith asked the medics to look at his foot first
1764420	1771080	Still worried about his recovery Keith took the ambulance to the contention clinic with the unconscious bald man
1771500	1775140	Clark's final words to Keith before the ambulance doors shut
1775740	1777740	Keep him cuffed
1778100	1782060	Officers Bishop and petty more headed to the suburbs to chat with dr
1782060	1787740	Marie Jacobs when they saw an unkempt man James the mill worker in rubber waders
1788300	1793460	Frantically vacuuming his lawn from across the street two children stared
1794300	1795380	unblinking
1795380	1800140	Horrified as the unkempt James began to float up into the air
1800360	1807060	Clark and John each grabbed a leg but the man continued to rise John called the two kids into action one holding
1807260	1813620	Desperately onto the vacuum as the other sucked up this unknown substance with the hose their plans seemed to work
1813620	1819340	All feet were now grounded in this oily sludge poured itself away down into the sewage drain
1820060	1822180	but then the vacuum
1822700	1827660	exploded engulfing the twin children in its contents this viscous ichor
1828460	1832260	As the fourth graders folded into the writhing mass
1832420	1838540	James the mill worker lost his shit and wriggled free from Clark's helping grasp turned restraint
1838860	1844660	when John pulled up next to the on-the-run unkempt man in rubber waders James looked the
1845100	1848380	mustachioed copper in the face and then broke
1849020	1856780	Completely the mill worker sprinted back home on the same street leaving Clark Bishop and John Lee petty more the fourth right outside their initial
1857140	1860360	destination the home of dr. Marie Jacobs
1860560	1864560	At the contention clinic Billy Harrison finally woke up
1864560	1868120	He had a concussion and had been unconscious for some time
1868480	1874400	Cuffed to the bed with officer Keith Vigna asking him a bunch of questions Billy answered slowly
1874640	1880660	He didn't remember some things. He was 31 years old. He remembered going to John Peters's house
1880920	1886560	John John was an old friend who hadn't responded to his messages or answered the phone in a couple days
1886800	1892460	They played video games together Billy remembered looking in the window and John didn't answer the door
1893360	1900100	Billy didn't know a Charles Donovan Keith told Billy he was tied up in the back of this Charles person's car
1900760	1906840	Billy said he drove a white van to John's house earlier that day Billy said he's on leave from the army
1907040	1909780	Billy said he doesn't know any dog groomers
1910480	1915560	Then Billy asked to be uncuffed since he was the victim of a crime
1916200	1918320	Now do you think Keith Vigna a
1919440	1921440	reacted rationally or
1921640	1922800	B
1922800	1929840	Escalated the situation became hostile and tried to handcuff Billy's other hand if you answered B
1931400	1933400	Congratulations, that's exactly right
1933440	1939080	And because it's Keith Vigna when he went to handcuff Billy's free hand the one-handed concussed
1939200	1945320	Probable victim of kidnapping got the drop on the officer pulled Keith's gun from its holster and threatened to shoot
1945720	1951620	Keith understood in this moment that Billy was willing to pull the trigger and so Keith surrendered
1952220	1959780	Officer beans unlocked Billy Harrison's handcuff and turned around which allowed the bald fit man to not Keith the fuck out
1960840	1967760	Back in the suburbs Clark Bishop and John Lee petty more the fourth had a rough go trying to get any information from dr
1967760	1970720	Marie Jacobs who did not want to open the front door
1970900	1975400	She asked if they had a warrant Clark remembering she bought the radio asked about it
1975400	1977700	And she told them the radio wasn't even there anymore
1978220	1981840	Apparently a tall drunk man came and took it by force
1982240	1987080	With a gun John decided they had reasonable suspicion for search and seizure
1987120	1989500	So he knocked down the door gun
1990040	1994840	Obviously drawn the Jacobs house was a wreck and there was a haze in the air
1995000	1999880	Clark and John could hear Marie talking down in the basement in this mad
2000560	2007560	Scientists house there was something covering every piece of counter space jars and beakers were sitting everywhere
2007560	2009560	It smelled absolutely
2009920	2011920	terrible kind of like shit
2012520	2016880	John found a litter box, but the fecal matter inside looked
2018720	2019840	Human
2019840	2022000	This was the moment John decided dr
2022000	2027800	Jacobs was for sure a witch Clark and John heard a man's voice meow in the basement
2028240	2035560	Quite the sight in comparison to her usual state. Dr. Jacobs had mascara all over her face and was wearing white coveralls and
2036280	2037720	neoprene gloves
2037720	2044760	After making eye contact with John for the first time the incredulous and crazed doctor invited him to join her in the kitchen
2045320	2051720	John and Clark having seen enough arrested and handcuffed dr. Marie Jacobs, but then she hollered
2052280	2054280	she hollered
2055960	2061640	And a glumping sound could be heard of something or someone
2062640	2068240	Bounding up the stairs on the evening of December 3rd officer Keith Vigna
2068240	2072300	Woke up wearing a thin gown with both of his wrists
2072440	2076920	Handcuffed to the sides of the hospital bed where Billy Harrison was recently confined
2077560	2082480	Keith's uniform Keith's gear and Billy Harrison were nowhere to be seen
2082800	2089080	However, the door to this room was now open and a decent amount of the clinic staff was standing around just outside
2089880	2092240	Some of them were pointing their phones at Keith
2092240	2097200	All of them were laughing a few phrases murmured loud enough to make out included
2097280	2102040	No wonder William was so embarrassed by him and oh isn't that Keith beans?
2102400	2106080	What's he calling himself now when they actually noticed Keith waking up
2106080	2113040	They awkwardly shuffled away and a young woman came into the room with bolt cutters and broke the links on the cuffs leaving officer Keith
2113040	2119720	Vigna with a pair of nice iron bracelets after collecting himself Keith checked the security footage and
2120080	2124880	Watched Billy Harrison walk right out the front door wearing his uniform
2125520	2128680	Back in the suburbs John had handcuffed. Dr
2128680	2135520	Marie Jacobs and something was running up the stairs that something was a bloody man wearing only
2135920	2142680	Briefs and a collar and he galloped up the stairs on all fours before tackling Clark into the ground
2142960	2146260	John kicked the man off Clark who recognized. Dr.
2146260	2153240	Marie Jacobs's husband Doug Jacobs from the family portraits around the house that included the couple and their black cat Salem
2153640	2160920	After they handcuffed Doug John asked dr. Jacobs why her husband is a cat man named Salem and Marie was like
2160920	2162920	Oh, so, you know
2163060	2169420	When asked why the officers arrived John said it was illegal to have a cat in a man's body. Dr
2169420	2171420	Jacobs argued there were no laws
2171440	2178480	Disallowing this sort of activity and preferring the current situation. She asked the cops to leave her be they claimed they just wanted information
2178960	2186360	So she told them she believed the radio did it the radio she purchased at Forgotten Treasures the officers wanted the radio
2186480	2193180	But like she said it was stolen a tall drunk man broke in punched poor Salem in the face and stole the radio
2194160	2197680	With coercion and a cat toy Clark and John got dr
2197680	2203960	Marie Jacobs and the cat Salem and the body of Doug Jacobs into the back of their police cruiser took them into the station
2204240	2211860	Made a human-sized cat bed in one of the cells and locked up the pair in the only cell not full of contraband from John
2211860	2214480	Peters's units at a plus storage
2215560	2222440	John went to pick Keith up at the clinic and found him standing outside in a hospital gown wearing handcuffs with the chain cut
2222680	2228240	Back at the station Clark forced drew to come to terms with Doug Jacobs being a cat man
2228640	2232320	After everyone reconvene drew had a word with John alone
2233040	2238800	Apparently Lauren the fourth and only other member of the contingent police department was
2238920	2242440	Confused about the amount of blood and gore at splashylvania
2243160	2248000	Drew said he told her a deer fell off a water slide and
2248400	2253880	Then he asked if it had something to do with all the cocaine locked up in the jail cell
2254400	2259840	He continued figuring John might be interested in unloading the whole pallet for around
2260280	2265260	Ten million dollars drew had a contact in the city called the Duke
2265960	2269860	They walked back in to talk to Clark and Keith and John said he had good news
2270640	2273040	Drew had fixed the four-wheeler
2273840	2279120	Following the lead of the room key from Hotel Motel found in Charles Donovan's possession
2279120	2283760	The three officers busted into the deceased man's room at Hotel Motel
2284360	2287080	guns drawn and without a warrant
2287560	2292800	There they found a woman dressed similarly to her favorite TV character the Fonz
2293560	2301120	This woman we now know as Rosemary flinged a knife at officer Vigna and hid on the other side of the bed
2301480	2306380	Keith ran up and engaged her in hand-to-hand combat which resulted in a hostage situation
2307000	2312060	Knife to his throat officer Vigna proceeded to brag about killing her coworker
2312980	2321300	Thankfully for his throat though the level-headed and highly persuasive officer Bishop managed to keep Rosemary from killing him there on the spot
2321300	2325340	By getting her talking Clark asked if she knew Charles they had worked together
2326100	2333060	Rosemary laughed and asked if they know who they're fucking with because they were fucking with Marvin Glass
2333620	2336020	the mob kingpin in the city
2336660	2340940	When asked about the radio she thought maybe the thing in the bathroom was a radio
2341260	2343260	Charles had brought it back but more importantly
2343740	2351980	Marvin sent them there to find out what happened to Jermaine Glass and Alfred Glass when they came to collect money from John Peters
2352660	2360180	Only Alfred came back, but he came back a blubbering idiot. He wouldn't shut up about some gun. He sounded like a lunatic
2360900	2368380	The wiry old lady made a run for it and leapt over the railing and into the Hotel Motel parking lot all three officers
2368700	2372480	Unloaded their weapons from the second floor corridor bringing her down
2373020	2375060	Barely before she could get into her vehicle
2375560	2383580	The boys in blue patched her up called an ambulance and sent her to the city hospital with Lauren the fourth and only other
2383920	2391640	Contention police officer with that they planned a sting operation based around a false radio call to catch Billy
2391820	2396520	Harrison the stranger running around contention in an official police uniform
2396760	2401040	They figured he like everyone else wanted John Peters
2401840	2407760	Unfortunately for the CPD the FBI was watching and also wanted to talk to John Peters
2408380	2415960	Strangely though agents Kennedy and McKinley a young woman with an erratic accent and an old man with empty eyes
2416280	2420760	Were in town looking for a black Nike bag with nothing in it
2421080	2423880	They thought John Peters would know where this bag was
2424120	2429240	They were correct in this line of thinking as there was indeed a black Nike bag in unit
2429480	2433360	G11 at a plus storage to which John Peters held the key
2434200	2441080	After some verbal dancing the federal agents agreed to meet the contention squad the following morning
2441100	2448160	December 4th at the police department when the officers met back up at the station to figure out what to do with their illegal seizures
2448280	2451120	Drew was uncommonly not at his desk
2451520	2455040	Replaced instead by a note telling them he went to the chief's house
2455600	2458160	officers Bishop and Pettymore hauled off the
2458560	2465520	Undocumented loot to their individual residences while Keith went to the chief's house to check on drew in the entrance of chief
2465520	2468060	Maggie cooks home Keith found two
2468500	2476280	Unconscious men drew Andrews and an unknown with ID for a Harold Dorsey from the city in the living room
2476280	2479480	He saw chief Maggie cooks body in full uniform
2480080	2487280	Slumped against the wall a large chef's knife rested in her left hand her face had been stabbed
2487920	2490960	Repeatedly and her left foot was missing
2491720	2493720	That's when he noticed the smell
2493960	2497120	gasoline and natural gas in the kitchen an
2497400	2503520	unkempt man was at the table hunched over with a fork in one hand and a pistol in the other a
2503720	2510520	Bullet hole in his head had left him face down in a plate of meat his left foot was also missing
2511120	2516480	Gas cans sat all over the place and the contents had clearly been poured on
2517320	2523360	Everything the range had all four burners turned all the way up and a skillet sat atop
2523960	2529500	Inside were the leftovers of two feet that had the meat pulled from them
2530180	2534940	He threw up and fell to his hands and knees his hand hit a wire
2535060	2539220	He heard a click and saw a fire near the front door and a path of gasoline
2539540	2547580	Heading back toward the kitchen with just enough time to save one person Keith dragged drew Andrews out the front door as the entire
2548140	2549620	house
2549620	2554420	Exploded knocking Keith into the front yard and rendering him unconscious
2556180	2558180	Keith
2558540	2560540	Standing in your childhood home
2560620	2561980	It's your birthday
2561980	2566660	And your friends are standing around this table waiting for you to blow out the candles on your cake
2566740	2570500	You look up and see your parents in the corner talking to your little brother
2570820	2578300	You squeeze your eyes tightly as you blow out your candles and as you do you see that black shiny viscous sludge
2578900	2586080	Inside this muck are two thrashing bodies their hands reach out trying to escape this thing that has trapped them
2586120	2594140	But the struggle does not last long their limbs seem to fold into this ooze becoming one with the sentient mass of goop
2594140	2598240	That is now sliding across the ground toward you opening your eyes
2598240	2603120	You see all of your peers around your childhood kitchen table laughing at you
2603120	2610520	The candles are still lit you look up your parents are poorly attempting to hold back laughter. You look at the cake
2610520	2611240	It's gone
2611280	2616560	You have a plate that is clean and you look around and see everyone else is eating a piece of cake
2616560	2623620	They're all laughing and begin to chant while pointing at you beans beans Keith beans his only friends are
2623920	2629000	figurines beans beans keys beans will blow your friends to smithereens
2629640	2631640	Your parents look at you
2631760	2635960	Disgusted and turn and walk out of the room you run to follow them
2636040	2642440	But looking ahead you only see that woman dressed in old-timey clothing looking down you fall
2642960	2647640	Fall into a black hole in the ground and you're standing in a cold
2648120	2655380	Dark room the lights begin to flicker on and you see massive tanks the size of grain silos
2655760	2662780	Standing right before you is yourself. You walk up to you the face of the other you begins to age
2663260	2671100	Rapidly and then just as rapidly ages in reverse you walk up to one of the massive tanks in this dank dimly lit room
2671220	2675680	You press your face against it to see its contents and something
2676140	2682140	Creeps toward you and as it's about to come into focus you wake up to the sound of sirens
2682580	2688820	officers Bishop and petty more were soon called to the Chiefs house after it had exploded leaving behind
2689500	2696580	The burned bodies of Harold Dorsey chief Maggie cook and an unkempt man with a bullet hole in his head
2696700	2699540	And his face in a pile of foot meat that man
2699860	2706240	We now know was James the mill worker the three cops decided they needed to go to dr
2706240	2712780	Millar the dentist and contention to verify and match the dental records of the three deceased folks
2713220	2720040	Clark looked in the Chiefs car and it was clean the glove box was empty the dashcam been unplugged
2720460	2727700	Clark checked the GPS history chief Maggie Cook's cruiser had been at the mill on the other side of the city
2727820	2730340	since the evening of December 1st
2731380	2734380	That night the strange dreams
2735140	2737780	continued John Lee petty more the fourth
2738740	2740540	The sky is dark
2740540	2743460	But the ground begins to give light to the world
2743900	2750060	You see a man in the distance with his head and hands and stocks that sit on an inky black
2750100	2758380	Stage as you walk toward this man the ground becomes wider and wider like a screens brightness level being gradually turned up
2758620	2763740	You hear a holler from behind you and when you turn around you see your mother she looks
2764420	2768100	She looks like she did when she was about your age and she's crying
2768780	2775220	She looks past you and the door appears in between you but you can hear her say I'm so sorry
2775900	2781620	He's just so beautiful. You don't have to do this. We can leave we can run
2781860	2788780	The door floats up into the sky and sitting behind it is that trunk you locked up in the police department with the woman
2788940	2790940	split head atop the black
2791060	2792540	Putrid hacked-up
2792540	2796860	Anatomy you turn around and you're face to face with a man in the stocks
2797060	2802220	John Peters his forehead burned and peeling with the word fool
2803360	2807380	Desperate his eyes widen and he whispers, please
2808140	2810140	It's coming
2810180	2815260	They are playing the roles of greater men. You have to save everyone
2816140	2818140	It is coming
2820940	2822940	You
2823500	2825460	Clark Bishop
2825460	2828180	You're walking through a parking lot you look down
2828500	2834580	You see you're carrying a piece of old parchments rolled up with a neat little string tied tightly around it
2834980	2839460	Looking up you hand it to the cashier at your local grocery store. You like this guy
2839980	2844260	Starting to scan the scroll, but it's not beeping. He looks at you and chuckles
2844700	2846700	This is going to cost you greatly
2847140	2852700	as you walk out of the grocery store you step into the sanctuary of a church during a funeral a
2852900	2860060	young boy with an enormous forehead in the darkest eyes you've ever seen is walking up to you and tears are
2860540	2866660	streaming down his face as he stares into your eyes you hear a small voice inside you that says
2867180	2873700	Please sir as the crying boy holds out his hands as you hand the scroll to the young boy
2873700	2876620	You begin to hear cries throughout the sanctuary
2876620	2880440	You're standing in as you look around the congregation is trying to run away
2880440	2886380	But they're melting into the floor you look down and you two are melting into the floor when you look up
2886380	2892100	The boy has been replaced by Tildi B Mitchell who looks down at you with her finger pointed at you like a gun
2892500	2898740	She disappears and reappears over and over again as you slowly sink into the floor as your eyes
2898900	2901940	Look to the ceiling of the chapel you hear a voice
2902620	2907580	Inside you say let go as you wake up in bed
2909560	2913620	John awoke to a text from Drew Andrews it reads
2913980	2919700	Clark came by last night when no one was at the station. He warned me not to go to the cheese house
2920100	2926320	He was limping, but he wasn't limping later. What is going on and where is all the cake?
2926820	2930920	There was also a text from Keith explicitly asking John for drugs
2931240	2938220	He rolled out of bed bagged up some coke and headed into the police station for work and a meeting with the FBI
2939680	2945420	Without a reply from officer petty more confirming he would bring some of the cocaine officer vigna
2945720	2950400	Drove up and broke into John Lee petty Moore's house to find it. This was cocaine
2950400	2955040	They stole from a storage unit after finding the key at the home of a missing person
2955560	2959520	At the station a news report played over the radio a
2959840	2964300	Fire at the city hospital had claimed the lives of more than 20 individuals
2964800	2969560	The names of the deceased are not being released yet more importantly to the officers
2969560	2973680	However was the decision of what to order for breakfast
2974360	2978160	Finally deciding on bishops big bean breakfast from beans on beans
2979480	2984040	Drew remembered that two children were reported missing from the suburbs
2984360	2988160	Aiden and Alice little John and Clark shot each other
2988600	2993440	Glance and then John changed the subject to the matter of a second Clark Bishop
2993680	2997760	Drew explained what happened on his end Clark came in around 1 a.m
2998220	3003260	Limping wearing a hoodie and jeans and told drew not to go to chief Maggie Cook's house
3003880	3008180	But Clark was attempting the sting operation with John and Keith at 1 a.m
3008720	3014500	The security footage showed Clark Bishop limping in and out the door in street clothes
3015180	3019720	So they decided moving forward. They would use a code word to assure each other
3019720	3024740	They were each dealing with the real version of themselves that code word
3025280	3031620	bubble gum tree as Keith vigna pulled back into the parking lot with breakfast a blacked-out SUV
3031980	3038780	Parked in agents Kennedy and McKinley hopped out from the passenger and back seats and headed in
3039220	3043220	Keith grabbed the food and Nike bag and followed them into the police station
3043900	3050860	Agent McKinley the old dead-eyed man scanned the office saw John started freaking out turning and sprinting away
3051340	3053980	Passing Keith as he ran back out into the lot
3054740	3059460	Agent Kennedy apologized for him saying their last mission went poorly and he's lost it a bit
3059860	3067500	Agent Kennedy also said she's from Minnesota with a weird Irish accent. The officers said they wanted answers
3067620	3069620	She promised to give information
3070100	3072700	After she put something in that bag
3073460	3075900	John asked if it was something strange
3076800	3078000	Yes
3078000	3083820	Agent Kennedy pulled out a small lockbox two inches by two inches with a combination lock on it
3084300	3088540	Inside was a small metal sphere with a diameter of one inch
3088780	3093780	She dropped the sphere into the bag and immediately breathed a sigh of relief
3094380	3096380	Clark looked into the bag
3096380	3098540	Nothing. He asked about the ball
3099220	3102820	She said it's why agent McKinley is so unintelligible now
3103380	3110020	So John called agent Kennedy to the back of the station to look at their cat man when she was more intrigued than confused
3110660	3117260	John freaked out and told the agent that there's a weird gun and a weird radio and a weird camera and the weird radio made
3117260	3122780	That guy into a cat man. Plus there's oil all over the place agent Kennedy side
3124340	3127480	She guessed that meant that they were in
3128540	3130540	She'd be right back
3130620	3132620	She walked out of the station
3132780	3135780	And walked back in with Billy Harrison
3136740	3138500	Billy Harrison
3138500	3140500	the bald fit man
3140700	3145180	Holding Keith's gun and belt atop his nicely folded uniform
3145260	3150460	Keith grabbed his shit and walked back to his desk and Billy said he hoped Keith was feeling better
3151100	3156260	Agent Kennedy dropped the bad accent and told Harrison all three officers had seen a lot of shit
3156440	3161460	She knew he wanted to get home. So maybe they should just leave the number and the bag and bail
3162100	3166580	He nodded Kennedy turned to the three cops and drew Andrews
3167620	3169620	You're completely fucked
3169900	3176300	Luckily for you all though. I'm gonna leave this bag here with you anything you put in it disappears. That's all we know about it
3176580	3180740	It's a myth even within this community who have seen the unnatural at work
3180740	3186160	But we have seen today all of us here that agent Victor's Nike bag is real
3187020	3194460	Guys, the world does not work the way we all grew up knowing it to be you're all charged now with understanding that
3195060	3199500	That understanding of the world will cause your lies to crumble
3199660	3206660	But the thing that keeps us going is that daily we are saving the human race from being wiped out of existence
3207460	3212420	I'm gonna leave this here with you all and you'll be given a secure location to drop it when the job is done
3212980	3215140	Your job is to stop the incursion
3215820	3222020	Minimize exposure save lives and cover the whole thing up to save others from being exposed
3222780	3227140	We're gonna give you the same information that all newcomers game which is a phone number
3227580	3233360	You give them a call when the situation is taken care of or if things get completely out of hand or they'll call in
3233360	3235260	48 hours if you don't
3235260	3237260	Good luck
3237260	3242620	Let's go back now to the past to a young Clark Bishop in his childhood home
3243580	3250520	The same home he lives in now back then the plastic was on the couch. There were angel wings and pictures of Jesus
3251320	3253340	Clark is playing in the living room
3253340	3257680	His parents are in the kitchen cooking and Wheel of Fortune is on like always in the background
3258080	3264080	Clark's mom pulls him close to repeat her go-to motto life is like the bonus round
3264120	3269880	We were already given the best letters and then she sends little Clark off to see mr
3269880	3274820	Gerald fingers in at the Mary Cole library contentions public book depository
3275180	3281500	With lemon poppy seed muffins in hand the library smells musty it's rarely used by the community
3282140	3287500	Gary Daly owner and operator of the daily fuzz having a loud conversation with mr.
3287500	3295540	Fingers and about occult books and currently open in front of him is the true and horrifying confessions of the st. Osseith witches
3296420	3304220	Clark presents the poppy seed muffins and fingers and puts the baked goods with the other batches due to his gluten intolerance
3304820	3306820	the phone rings
3311260	3313260	Gerald answers
3313700	3320220	Gerald says it was for Clark. He says the voice on the other line said that Clark has the best letters
3321020	3323020	the voice sounded panicked and
3323900	3325820	screamed a little
3325820	3327940	Outside the sky turns dark
3328780	3333100	The immediate lack of sunlight is noticed inside the Mary Cole library
3333740	3340460	Strange forms of tall gaunt men begin moving around outside the library a
3340780	3348320	Figure in the darkness wearing a cloak is locking the doors of the library from the outside with a massive chain
3348860	3352300	He turns and runs and out of one of the windows
3352620	3357940	You see a massive flash of light a gigantic shadow moves out of frame
3357940	3363780	It's an enormous but thin man in a black suit sprinting away from the cloaked figure
3364900	3371140	Drawed opens a window light comes back into the world and everything seems as it once was
3372020	3378500	Clark looks at mr. Daly who's staring at his book Gary looks up and asks if there was a big cloud mr.
3378500	3385380	Fingers and thinks the occult books must have something to do with this so Daly reads aloud what he'd been reading when it went dark
3385700	3386660	And
3386660	3388020	Casting her eyes aside
3388020	3395740	She saw a spirit lift up a cloth line over a pot looking much like a ferret and it being asked of this
3396100	3398700	Examine it why the spirit did look upon her
3398780	3400900	She said it was hungry this
3401140	3408220	Examine it being asked how she knew the names of mother Bennett spirits say if the Tiffin her spirit did tell this
3408380	3415180	Examine it that she had two spirits the one of them like a black dog and the other red like a lion and that their
3415180	3421020	Names were sucking and layered and sayeth that sucking did plague by its wife on to death and the other
3421100	3424780	Plagued three of his beasts where of two of them died
3424780	3431220	But before he could finish the three decide to not speak of this again when Clark arrives home
3431540	3437500	When he turns the corner his mind can't quite handle what it's seeing and it begins to fragment
3437940	3441940	One scene then another first he sees his house in perfect condition
3442460	3447940	His consciousness changes channels and he sees police officers everywhere it flips again
3448220	3452380	Everything's normal it flips again and two black sedans are outside the house
3452900	3457340	Flips again. Everything's normal as he walks into the house. There's a flash
3457460	3461940	He sees his parents have been lifted off the ground and are half
3462340	3469340	Inside the walls of the home their faces are frozen and cold and white with the lack of blood it flips again
3469580	3471100	Everything looks normal
3471100	3474940	But he hears voices it flips he sees people someone says yeah
3474940	3480100	We well we couldn't find the artifact and we had to get the fuck out of there cuz Karen did her goddamn
3480380	3486500	Magic trick again, and then everything is normal. Then he hears whispers. Then he sees a man wearing a suit
3486500	3494020	Oh shit, it's a fucking kid man Clark is sitting in a courtroom in contention and he's trying to think back on that day
3494020	3498520	But he can't remember anything except for how normal it all was
3499420	3501420	How his house just looked normal
3502060	3504660	But empty it just weren't there anymore
3505300	3507300	But here there's a woman
3507700	3515340	She's on trial. She's being convicted right now for the death of Clark's parents. Her name is Anne love
3516020	3523540	She's cold and vacant, but she's always smiling and her asymmetrical bangs cover one of her eyes
3523940	3525940	on the stand she says
3526340	3529880	Yes, I did it and I'd do it again
3533860	3541800	Back in current times the officers went to the Daily Fuh after Gary Daly called in to report information about the Chiefs disappearance
3542380	3548260	Gary Daly was the longtime partner of Harry Klinker and the owner operator of the Daily Fuh a
3548540	3550780	Contention staple that had been around for generations
3551780	3553580	Gary Daly was an older man
3553580	3561560	He wore jeans cuffed halfway up his calves and a nice short sleeve button-down with tiny cartoon bean sprouts printed all over it
3561780	3568300	He asked if the officers remembered when he would help watch them down at Klinker's when they were but wee little fellas and
3568500	3572980	Invited them back to his office some of the art hanging in the walls of the Daily Fuh
3572980	3574980	However caught the boys attention
3575100	3581140	One was a circle with a star inside of it inside that star was another star and there were a couple
3581420	3587540	Triangles curved lines and tiny circles as well a fun take on the chaoticness of the universe
3588060	3594200	Another was a tree branch with three twigs growing on one side and two twigs growing on the other
3594540	3601540	It was in a bunch of old texts that Gary had seen at different museums and libraries from various cultures and eras
3602020	3605780	Another print was a black circle with six black dots
3606220	3612900	Surrounding it an ancient sign for a group that might have existed called the circle of knowledge
3613220	3615220	They tried to keep the world together
3615520	3621980	The last was a wonky question mark with two additional lines one curved and one straight
3622040	3624780	jutting down from the question marks dot a
3625340	3627340	symbol of a land unknown
3628340	3636360	Anyway, Gary had heard Harold Dorsey was in town and wanted a blog post at what's behind Dorsey dot blogspot.com written about the
3636360	3637500	Daily Fuh
3637500	3640500	So he was kind of sort of stalking Harold Dorsey
3640760	3646740	He followed Dorsey to the Chiefs house and saw a guy holding the chief and James at gunpoint
3647460	3653340	The guy with the gun was overweight wearing all black and had a big scar over his right eye
3653980	3658820	James was wearing rubber waders and the chief seemed off
3659180	3663740	She didn't stand up straight the way chief cook would in the phone book
3663780	3671440	They found an address for James Keith remembered the hunched over unkempt guy at the Chiefs house was wearing rubber
3671860	3673260	waders John
3673260	3679500	Remembered the unkempt man with the vacuum was wearing rubber waders and the address for James matched
3679900	3682900	Just down the street from dr. Marie Jacobs house
3683780	3691620	Let's go once again into the past to a young John Lee Pettymore the fourth just after the moment that ended his sprint car
3691740	3693520	racing career
3693520	3697980	John Lee Pettymore the fourth and Don D Pettymore John's dad's cousin
3698500	3704580	Are sitting in the back of an ambulance and the EMT is checking out John. She tells the young Pettymore
3704580	3706700	There's just no way he'll ever race again
3707220	3713460	Don grabs John's face and tells him he's got to give up on this dream now and they hug
3714140	3717540	Don pushes John in a wheelchair out to the parking lot
3717540	3721560	But from the rear Don sees two figures begin approaching
3721860	3725700	They're both extremely tall with large gaunt frames
3725880	3731880	They begin walking faster and faster toward the two Don starts running with the wheelchair
3731880	3738720	But the two figures are catching up there's no one else around they're both wearing black suits and their skin is weirdly
3739400	3744640	Translucent one of them starts screaming John hollers get at the fanciest men
3744640	3750520	He's ever seen and the Pettymore boys make it to the parking lot just in time to see their car
3750760	3757280	Now being flipped over by large Eddie and his pit crew John yells at large Eddie and large Eddie
3757520	3760700	Approaches the two petty Moore's Eddie swings
3761200	3763480	Don catches large Eddie's hand
3764000	3770120	Mudders under his breath and large Eddie's hand starts sizzling like a country fried steak on a Sunday morning
3770560	3778240	Smoke starts coming out of there Eddie screams Don holds on before dropping it and hitting him once more in the face
3778760	3780760	Eddie runs off hollering
3781120	3785320	Don helps the concussed John Lee Pettymore the fourth into their car
3787880	3794160	Back in the current timeline the officers went to the first Church of Contingent on the way there
3794160	3798120	They noticed a strange occurrence the creek though
3798120	3804560	It was a chilly December day was filled to the brim with animals of all sorts dogs cats possums
3805000	3812680	Raccoons town creatures of all kinds the FCC was hosting a lunch for anyone who needed it made by the pastor's wife and children
3812920	3814920	And served by the youth group
3815080	3822840	Keith vigna impatient and rude broke into pastor Adam Kane's office and stole the old motorcycle helmet from off his desk
3823160	3830260	The helmet had some tubes on either side with one green and one red light and the red light was lit
3830320	3830980	But hey
3830980	3837540	It turns out maybe Keith is a monster to be around because his dad was a dick who clearly preferred Keith's older brother Ferguson
3837680	3842300	Way back when they were children while playing on their family's sprawling estate
3842340	3849820	Keith and Ferguson heard the alarm sirens blaring as strange gaunt men in suits appeared to fall from the sky
3850340	3858300	However, they were promptly shot down by the beans security personnel that night William being sat the boys down and told them
3858300	3864020	What happened is exactly why they have security and he added the most important thing is
3864700	3870100	Ferguson safety William took Ferguson to his workshop leaving Keith to hide an eavesdrop
3870660	3873640	That's when he told Ferguson why he was so important
3873800	3876100	He said he didn't know how much longer he'd be around
3876100	3882980	He had hoped that he would be the one to fulfill the prophecy, but it is not him. It is Ferguson
3883580	3887740	Ferguson is the anointed when the time is right
3887740	3894100	he must go back and save the world and with that he handed Ferguson a watch and
3894580	3897780	Promised that it would fit when the time was right
3900580	3907500	Back in whatever year it is now the officers took the pastor's helmet to the police station and locked it up in the evidence room
3907580	3914300	Along with the other items from the booth at Forgotten Treasures the gun camera and radio all in separate lockers
3914340	3919260	They were all showing a red light except for the camera green light lit
3919900	3923320	Outside the station John took a picture of Keith with this glass
3923560	3931440	Two-blind camera and there was a massive flash of bright light and an inky black substance was all over John's hands and
3931840	3938560	Dripping down from the camera and the picture it was pooling on the ground and they could swear it was moving
3938920	3941620	Then they blinked and the substance was gone
3942080	3947400	John's hands were clean and he was just holding this odd device and even odder
3947720	3954800	Picture the camera's light was red again and the picture showed two men in a room made of darkness
3955080	3957760	They could barely make out the two figures in the picture
3957760	3963240	Thanks to the light from a small candle also made out of a substance without color
3963400	3966040	The candle was sitting on a table made of the same
3966720	3973240	unbelievably black texture of the two men one was a slender muscular man in a black t-shirt
3973560	3978840	Revealing tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms going down his hands to his fingertips
3979240	3984840	He was kneeling before the other man who looked like a no bullshit actual cowboy
3985040	3989600	This man this cowboy seemed to be looking into the camera
3989960	3994520	Holding his hand up to block his face from the cameras flash and sight on
3994960	4001480	their way to the mill on the other side of the city the officers drove on a bridge over a creek and there were loads
4001520	4004360	Of animals in the water at this part of the creek as well
4004800	4011200	John threw his lights on to get ahead of Clark and as he passed he saw the sky ahead begin to swirl
4011440	4017240	About 30 feet above the ground a flat oval began to form the sky around it
4017520	4022040	Spiraled like cloth making folds as it gathered and bunched in places
4022040	4027680	The oval was black but this technicolor energy was erupting from its darkness
4027680	4034600	And then just as swiftly the sky was just as it was but something was falling
4035480	4041940	Suddenly the windshield of John's vehicle shattered and tiny shards of glass covered everything
4042640	4050360	Slumped across officer petty Moore's dashboard was the lifeless body of a grown man and blood was splattered
4050680	4054680	Everywhere he lost control of the vehicle and swerved into oncoming traffic
4055280	4062040	Hearing the sound of a horn blaring as it roared closer and closer before the cruiser jerked to a stop
4062200	4067440	all three officers saw the flash of a car fly by and then they heard a
4068200	4072640	deafening crash and the rumble of fire in
4073440	4077520	the chaos it was hard to understand what all had happened a
4078000	4084660	minivan was run off the road by officer petty Moore the former teen sprint car racer who was banned from the circuit after an
4084680	4087380	accident that left multiple bystanders hospitalized
4088200	4092860	Officer Bishop slammed into the back of petty Moore's cruiser and there was fluid leaking
4093200	4100120	Everywhere the minivan that narrowly avoided the head-on collision with John it flipped and caught fire
4100760	4108560	Petty Moore worked diligently to keep the two police cruisers from exploding which likely would have killed officer vigna who couldn't handle the
4108660	4110660	situation and fell unconscious
4110980	4116260	Thrust into the memories of a particularly traumatic childhood Christmas
4116860	4122980	Officer Bishop pulled a young boy from the fiery wreckage of the minivan, but it might have already been too late
4123780	4130700	Before he could go back to save the woman trapped behind the wheel as well as the other passenger the minivan combusted
4132200	4134700	Looking at the body on John's windshield
4135840	4139420	They'd finally found their missing John Peters
4140420	4148180	Just hadn't expected him to fall out of the sky the balding man with large eyes and a small nose was wearing a pair of
4148260	4151260	Jeans and a button-down shirt and on his forehead
4152140	4155100	Recently branded into the skin was the word
4155620	4157420	fool
4157420	4165120	The ambulance arrived and firemen were seen pulling a woman's charred remains from the driver's seat of the minivan
4165840	4170640	Two others from the back of the van pulled out the body of a small girl
4171720	4177080	Drew pulled up in Keith's Cruiser because he got a call from the estate salesman at James's house
4177560	4185400	Apparently he found some unsettling writing and blood and many many guns after accidentally triggering some secret
4185400	4190280	Door trap the salesman was wondering if he could sell the guns in the estate sale
4190280	4193120	Drew had told him the police needed to look at the scene first
4193560	4198980	Drew and John then very subtly walked over to the ditch off the side of the road to speak privately
4199520	4205960	Drew said he received a message from the Duke the deal was going down that night at 2 a.m.
4206640	4212680	John offered drew 5% to convince the Duke to do the deal out at the Pettymore farm
4213240	4220060	Drew and John then walked back up and they all saw a wet black cat running toward them from off the road
4220180	4225420	The cat seemingly panicked jumped on to John's leg and meowed like crazy
4225800	4230300	John held the cat up and told Doug they were gonna get him the help
4230300	4236120	He needed at this point a small but vocal group of the contention population began
4236500	4239420	Protesting and letting these officers know how they felt
4239740	4246900	Drew apologized to the officers for not passing along critical information like the calls about missing persons
4247300	4251820	Animals in the ponds and creeks as well as a voicemail from the feds
4252400	4257320	Doug dr. Marie Jacob's husband who is inhabiting the body of their cat Salem
4257560	4264940	Conveyed to the officers that the animals were hiding in the water because the oily substance could not get them in the ponds and creeks
4264940	4271420	And at James the mill workers house the estate salesman Randy angst dressed in a fancy blue
4271580	4278080	Three-piece suit holding a cane with a big tooth on the top handed the cops a card when he greeted them
4278300	4283460	The card said mr. Angst is the dentist and the estate salesman in town
4283580	4291600	He also founded the contention historical society when asked about the picture from the odd camera John found in Julie Maxwell's car
4291780	4298860	angst noted that a few of the folks were dressed in clothes about a hundred years off from the rest when questioned about Cole's
4299220	4305220	Orphanage the dentist slash estate salesman recalled an orphanage by that name opening about
4305500	4311580	25 years prior though it did close down within a year in James the mill workers house
4311580	4314800	They found a cache of guns hidden under the coffee table
4315260	4321740	Riding in blood where one of the guns should be that read stop her and a large plastic tube all
4322100	4326980	Revealed after touching the bow tie of a statue of a man wearing a tuxedo
4327380	4334940	There are a bunch of cleaning supplies random materials and a handwritten list hidden in a small enclave
4335580	4343860	behind an oil painting of a rose all the liquids had been crossed out including the three listed types of water tap
4344140	4349420	distilled and boiling and all of the materials had been crossed out except
4350020	4357740	Neoprene a kind of synthetic rubber when Clark tapped the white hard hat atop the suit of armor in the foyer
4357980	4365580	He found a trapdoor and fell into a 12 foot deep pit with two corpses a man and a woman in
4365700	4374020	One of their pockets was a paper with a hand-drawn symbol a circle encircled by six circles in the front room
4374020	4377700	There was a grand piano without strings and in the kitchen
4377700	4384380	there are a few loose tiles where something heavy metal and buried had been dragged out as
4384700	4392960	The place was being searched a heavy artillery weapon began firing into the house from the front yard a looming
4393460	4395460	Overweight man wearing an all-black
4396240	4401520	Combat uniform with a large scar over his right eye blasted the door from its frame
4401800	4407800	Almost cut officer Bishop's arm off froze at the command of officer petty more and
4408440	4416280	Eventually after a brutal combat between the contingent boys and the massive metal man flew out of the window bottomless
4416880	4420720	Gripping the throat of officer vigna. Thank beans
4420720	4427080	He poked that terminator top in the eye just in time to escape falling to the ground before the metal fella
4427800	4429800	exploded like fireworks
4430200	4437280	The officers cleaned themselves up after fighting this large robot man seemed to perhaps have feelings
4438080	4443800	Continuing the investigation of James the mill workers house Keith vigna found a single piece of music
4444440	4449560	entitled the rise of the end in the bench of the stringless piano
4450400	4453200	Clark Bishop found in the large plastic tube
4453920	4456600	blueprints for calm comfy campground a
4457240	4464480	Suspiciously planned out set of seven buildings six encircling a large one in the center on an island
4464920	4466920	sitting on Lake calm
4467560	4471180	They all stood there in James the mill workers house and the officers
4471440	4477520	Remembered he died in chief Maggie Cook's house with a bullet in his head face down in a plate of foot me
4477960	4480560	They remembered the contents of the present
4480600	4483160	She received from an unknown source the night
4483160	4490020	She took off a red rose a white hardhat and a black silk bowtie all of which
4490600	4497560	present in this home in a painting on a suit of armor and worn by a statue respectively
4498140	4505360	They called Florence the fourth and only other contention police officer, but it went to voicemail immediately
4505880	4513420	After undressing the bottom half of the still standing robot man's legs the gang found a logo on the smooth
4513760	4519320	Pelvic area an M made of four double helices
4522160	4529700	Late on the night of December 4th after the weirdest dinner and wheel of fortune session Clark Bishop had ever been subject to
4529700	4536300	Due to his super fucking weird new co-worker Keith Vigna left the Bishop home headed back to Hotel Motel
4536460	4539720	And was approached by his niece Francis beans
4540240	4547340	She offered her uncle officer Vigna one million dollars from her inheritance to kill her father
4547860	4549680	Keith's brother
4549680	4556260	Ferguson beans upon accepting her proposal the two began driving east away from contention
4557060	4562820	John got home to find his place had been turned over his smoky and the bandit DVDs had been knocked and
4563020	4569180	Stepped on among the mess was a Burgatory rewards card for Keith Vigna
4569740	4576340	John vowed to kill Keith, but first he smoked a bowl and put on smoky
4576780	4579240	Drew eventually showed up holding a pistol
4579240	4584380	But by the top so John showed drew how to use the safety on his pistol
4584380	4587900	And they went out to the shooting tree to practice aiming and firing
4588420	4595060	With final preparations for the coke deal with the Duke in place John made a bird call and another call
4595380	4597380	replied from the woods
4598180	4599820	At 2 a.m.
4599820	4607140	technically the morning of December 5th a white 15 passenger van pulled up to the Pettymore property with the words
4607640	4612780	Jesus Christ Ministries painted on the side filled with children
4613260	4618020	Pulling a white trailer that also said Jesus Christ Ministries
4618820	4623100	The most handsome man John had ever seen hopped out of this van
4623540	4626960	Perfect hair perfect teeth a perfect jawline
4626960	4633380	And he was wearing the fuck out of a bright white suit with a red rose pinned perfectly to his lapel
4633740	4639460	Coke was buried in two holes and John would point out where to dig when he received half the money
4639780	4644660	Same plan for the second half a bunch of children ran out of the van all carrying
4644860	4651220	Shovels in the same way and they lined up waiting for the Duke on his command the children began digging
4651780	4656740	John asked if the kids all have the same mom. Yeah, you could you could say that
4658140	4665320	After the children loaded the cocaine into the trailer behind the van the Duke handed John the briefcase with
4665680	4671840	$5,000,000 in it same thing happened behind the woodpile as it did beneath the big tree the
4672240	4679360	Transaction went smoothly and John offered the Duke a thousand dollars for information about Marvin Glass
4679840	4684060	The Duke doesn't like Marvin Glass see glass is a competitor
4684060	4689640	But also a customer Marvin Glass buys in bulk when the Duke was asked about his rose
4689860	4691600	He said he liked the smell
4691600	4699260	Laughed and admitted he had no sense of smell when John asked about the kids the Duke said goodbye to Drew got back in the van
4699260	4702680	Drove down the long driveway and out onto the country road
4703160	4708000	John whistled and eight petty more cousins came walking out from the woods received their payment
4708160	4715640	Ten grand and a 24 pack of Keystone light each and they all fired their guns into the air in celebration
4716200	4721280	Back at the Bishop abode Clark heard Keith leave got up and locked the front door
4722000	4723320	Walking back to bed though
4723320	4728500	He looked out the window to Coles Creek which flows down south from the lake at Centennial Park
4728760	4734760	The whole thing was packed with animals a fair few people had been out there earlier looking for their pets
4734760	4737200	But not at this late hour too dark too cold
4738080	4744180	And they saw a humanoid figure hobbling down the frigid waterway in his direction
4744300	4750680	It was running but it seemed to be fighting through a limp and when it reached the point in the creek
4750860	4757580	Closest to Clark's house. He leapt from the water and began screaming and waving his arms all while looking directly
4758380	4760380	toward Clark's window
4760460	4767900	Clark's brain had a hard time comprehending what it was. He was seeing but this man this man running towards him
4768580	4770580	It was him
4770740	4773740	And then a warm pinch on the back of the neck
4774180	4776740	and Clark's vision tunneled to a close
4779460	4783420	Clark came to as a black bag was being snatched off his head
4783420	4787340	He felt hung over and his chest was weird and tight
4787540	4794500	It smelled damp and earthy and there was a haze around the torch above shedding partial light from the middle of the small
4795220	4796900	stonewalled room
4796900	4803900	Clark was sitting in a chair across a stone table from a man with gray hair under a white hard hat and a charcoal suit
4803900	4810100	With a bolo tie the man looked relaxed as he tossed the black bag onto the table and began to speak
4811220	4813440	After Richard the third's coronation
4813440	4817720	He was visited by a seer from Leichster who called himself the overseer
4817900	4821940	The seer claimed that the now king was to hold some very important knowledge
4822200	4828340	But would need to have the restraint to not abuse this power Richard was given this knowledge
4828940	4830300	But he couldn't handle it
4830420	4833140	He lost his mind and killed his two nephews
4833140	4837500	The overseer disappointed eventually passed the same knowledge to Henry Tudor
4837500	4839500	So he could whoop Richard at Bosworth
4839500	4844580	Henry the seventh held this power and eventually passed it down to a reliable and trusted confidant
4844660	4846840	Thankfully not his piece of shit son
4847220	4855140	This knowledge was passed down repeatedly abused and respected respected and abused until it made its way over the Atlantic to the colonies
4855560	4861640	Eventually landing with a high order of masons a select few held this information for generations
4861900	4864100	But a grand purpose was never found
4864740	4869980	Until Paul Simon the politician not the singer soon after being elected to the Senate
4869980	4874440	He was walking near his home when he came across the first known xenon imitode
4874860	4880540	He sought out Robert Byrd the Senate minority leader at the time to share his newfound understanding of the world
4881020	4886580	Thankfully for the world Byrd was among those carrying the knowledge of the overseer from centuries before
4887260	4892140	Together they formed a small circle of men to hold the weight of this realization
4892880	4898260	Today we carry on their tradition by keeping the darkness out of this world
4898460	4903820	We are the opaque rampart delaying the destruction of life as we know it
4904220	4906720	Welcome to the circle of knowledge
4907280	4912200	You have questions, I'm sure and I know this sounds hypocritical after that lengthy oration
4912200	4918640	But as my high school English teacher would always say show don't tell he reached under the table
4918640	4923180	And as he stood up he held up an unspeakable worm like
4923560	4931520	Abomination with one hand away from his body the thing was two feet long and tube like covered in a squamous black
4931760	4933360	partially translucent
4933360	4935360	membrane its body
4935600	4937600	Segmented and toxically green
4937960	4943700	Pulsating arteries and veins could be seen through its thin looking exterior. It had no
4944360	4946920	Identifiable eyes or nose its cavernous
4947480	4954640	Circular mouths one sitting just inside the other were lined with hooked teeth and it spit out a saliva
4954640	4957400	That was somehow darker than black
4958400	4960400	You
4964520	4969720	Keith vigna sat in the car of his niece Francis beans a Chrysler Sebring
4970040	4974880	She'd offered him 1 million dollars to kill her father his brother Ferguson beans
4975800	4980680	After some back roads through the woods she pulled up to a black iron fence
4981120	4986640	Francis hopped out in motion for teeth to follow her she opened a hatch in the ground and jumped inside
4987640	4989640	Disappearing from view
4989720	4996820	Keith followed down the hatch into a dark underground tunnel lit by red lights on the walls every 15 feet
4997040	5003500	France told him he'll pop up on the estate in a sweet spot with no security and he'll have a straight shot to the house
5003960	5007880	Keith went up followed her directions and made his way into Ferguson's house
5008520	5009480	undetected
5009480	5014120	Keith searched for and found bleach ammonia and a towel
5014520	5021080	But when Keith walked into Ferguson's room the lights were out there were candles on either side of the bed and lit by
5021240	5026040	Candlelight was a woman on top of the sheets in bedware, but not Stacy
5026600	5032640	Not Ferguson's wife. This was an older woman a generation older than Ferguson and Keith
5033160	5040400	She freaked out Keith calmed her down said he's a contention police officer and that he got a call that someone had broke in
5040800	5043620	She claimed she was there to meet Ferguson
5044120	5048840	This was Joan Robin the mother of Ferguson's business partner
5048840	5053960	Bruce Joan explained that Ferguson offered her a million dollars to sleep with him
5053960	5057920	So he could make your mom jokes to his business partner
5059020	5061020	Keith told her she had two options
5061360	5065420	She could leave or she could shoot Ferguson when he came into the room
5065720	5072560	Joan realized with Ferguson gone her son would take control of the company Keith offered her half a million dollars
5072760	5081120	And she accepted Keith found Ferguson's revolver handed it to Joan and a car could be heard pulling up to the house a
5081240	5088080	white 15 passenger van with the words Jesus Christ Ministries painted on the side pulled into the
5088240	5095040	pristine Circle Drive the van pulled a white trailer that also said Jesus Christ Ministries a
5095640	5102220	Beautiful man got out of the passenger side of the van. He had perfect hair perfect teeth a perfect jawline
5102560	5108960	And he was wearing the fuck out of a bright white suit with a red rose pinned perfectly to his lapel
5109960	5111960	It was Keith's brother
5112000	5113080	Ferguson beans
5113080	5120360	He clicked a button on his keys and as he walked toward his home the ground around the van and trailer began to move
5120360	5126840	And shift the entire vehicular ensemble was transported below ground on some crazy
5127200	5134000	Futuristic elevator of sorts as the driveway closed back up with no evidence the van or trailer had ever
5134360	5141280	Sat there Keith hid in the closet with the ammonia bleach and towel the door opened shut
5141920	5143080	and
5143080	5145080	Ferguson hollered upstairs
5145080	5149160	Joan the power out scared Joan yelled back
5149160	5151160	It must have been the storm
5151400	5159080	The door to the room opened and Keith heard a shot then a scream then another shot then a different scream then another shot
5159080	5162640	And another shot and another shot, and then Keith heard crying
5162920	5169800	It sounded like Joan Keith opened the door of the closet to see Ferguson on the floor in a white suit with a rose on
5169800	5173340	His lapel riddled with holes from his own gun
5173840	5180800	Joan ran to Keith and hugged him Keith started crying Joan was crying Keith told Joan to calm down and
5181200	5183560	Lay on the bed so he could clean up the scene
5184200	5188000	Joan sat at the end of the bed with her head in her hands and Keith
5188600	5190520	Keith grabbed the bleach
5190520	5197720	Ammonia mixed it up on the rag he walked over to Joan and tried to lock his arm behind her head and forced the rag
5197720	5202880	Over her mouth, but Joan got her hand in between her mouth and the towel Keith attacked again violently
5202960	5206080	He held her down on the bed until she passed out
5206720	5210380	Officer Keith Vigna grabbed the revolver with his handkerchief
5210760	5215200	Put it in Joan's hand held the gun to her head and pulled the trigger
5215840	5222280	Leaving the room to look like Joan shot Ferguson five times before turning the gun on herself
5223640	5227220	Walking away Keith saw the watch on Ferguson's wrist
5227840	5232360	It was the same watch their dad William given Ferguson when they were kids
5232960	5234800	Keith took the watch
5234800	5236800	Noticing there's nothing on the face
5237280	5244300	And slipped in in his pocket when all the sudden his consciousness began changing like changing the channel
5244300	5247840	He began to phase out of his reality seems to be somewhere else
5248560	5250040	entirely
5250040	5252880	Keith felt wet grass and dirt on his fingers
5252920	5259920	He was looking at a door in the ground like a sealed metal door that was mostly buried and on the door was an inscription
5260240	5263120	It read here lies the beans
5264120	5268640	Scientists beyond measure saviors of the world
5270360	5276200	Keith walked back through the tunnel under the ground with the red lights with glazed eyes
5277280	5284700	Keith back at the hotel stuck the watch in the handkerchief into the room safe and laid down flat on his bed
5285700	5293060	John Lee Pettymore just successfully made five million dollars by selling cocaine to a random handsome
5293500	5299660	Stranger named the Duke paid him a grand to know that Marvin Glass buys from him in bulk and paid eight
5299820	5305060	Cousins ten grand in a 24 pack of Keystone light each to which they took a Pettymore
5305500	5309860	Sky-shot and headed off into the night drew walked up and said, thank you
5310420	5314260	Thank you for making all this money for showing him how to shoot a gun
5315100	5319460	With all the money drew planned on donating his house to Boys and Girls Club
5319460	5327340	And then it's probably just gonna bail and then drew drove off down the long driveway to the country road home alone
5328180	5330180	John wanted to kill Keith vigna
5330180	5337260	but he opted for leaving Keith drunk voicemails slamming three more beers snorting another line brushing his teeth and
5337900	5341060	Sending Keith a text that just says I
5341620	5343060	know
5343060	5349460	John then swept up his smoky DVDs put in the director's cut and fell asleep smoking and join on his couch
5349780	5352220	dreaming of his millions but also of
5352860	5354660	terrible monsters
5354660	5357460	He woke up to the sound of two gunshots
5358100	5362980	Rose Mary was holding six Pettymores and drew hostage outside
5363140	5367060	Two Pettymores were faced down in the dirt and she called out for John
5367700	5374040	He came out on his front porch with his hands up. She told him her boss Marvin Glass wants the gun
5374500	5380620	John John thinks they can help each other glass wants his boys back right John wants his town back, right?
5380900	5387340	She said she was sent to collect this gun and John asked if he could deliver it. She agreed first
5387540	5389460	She let the cousins all go free
5389460	5394740	Then she got John and drew into the front of Drew's Mini Cooper hopped in the back and held their own
5394940	5400260	Guns at them while they drove back into town to the contention police department
5403100	5408120	Clark was in the circular stone room with the stone table lit by a torch
5408260	5413780	The man sat across from him put down the creature into a container between his legs and closed the lid
5414460	5420060	Before introducing himself as Leon Simpson, he welcomed Clark into the circle of knowledge
5420820	5428020	Clark's first task began forthwith Leon pulled out a small plastic container and slid it toward Clark
5428500	5434380	He took a gun out of his pockets a tranquilizer and in the plastic container were a pair of needles
5435140	5438660	Leon told Clark these darts were filled with a particular
5438660	5443140	Toxin to make anyone obey for some time
5443420	5450540	The job was this an FBI agent was on his way to contention to take over the missing persons cases as
5450820	5454020	This would be bad for Clark and for the circle of knowledge
5454620	5460140	Clark needed to tranq this FBI agent and make sure he didn't see anything funny going on
5460760	5466820	Leon Simpson asked Clark what exactly had been going on that was so funny in contention and Clark
5467580	5470180	Clark spilt those beans
5470940	5477540	Leon was impressed by the sheer amount of strange information coming from Clark and so reiterated his current mission
5477740	5482860	Keep the FBI agent away from any of the strangeness any of the goo or ooze or whatever
5482860	5485140	They're calling it. This next part was important
5485140	5492360	Clark had 24 hours and then Leon needed him to report back so they could make sure that he'd be okay
5493040	5497600	Clark asked about the creature. Leon told them it's a xenonema toad
5498180	5504480	Currently they believe these things are a vector either from another time another place or another reality. They're not quite positive
5504720	5510620	However, they're the things Paul Simon found that connected the dots to the knowledge of the overseer
5510840	5514160	These creatures are not of this place
5514160	5521500	They have certain abilities the circle of knowledge has found a way to exploit and they are necessary kept around for a very
5522100	5523940	specific purpose
5523940	5531680	Again, Leon decided to show not tell he opened the one door in this room into another circular stone room
5531680	5533680	This one was much bigger
5533780	5541520	20 yards across with a domed ceiling the walls were stone and there were a handful of torches mounted to light the room
5541980	5548660	There were six large slabs of stone each with a couple of people laying on them circling a single
5548980	5554560	Unoccupied stone slab in the center of the space each person laying down had one of those giant
5554660	5562180	Fucked up worm things attached to them and many of them seemed to have dead skin covering one or multiple limbs
5563340	5568980	There's also a woman an electric blue slacks and a bright yellow cardigan walking
5569260	5576060	Deliberately around each slab checking on each group and checking her watch. She smiled when she saw Clark Bishop
5576420	5578660	Leon explained that these brave men and women
5579020	5582900	Motioning to the people on the slabs who all looked very down on their luck
5582900	5588300	These fine individuals have dedicated their lives to the survival of humanity
5588580	5594560	Clark questioned their willingness and Leon argued that things around here were much better than they used to be
5595060	5597060	Anyway, Clark needed to get going
5597060	5602260	the timer had already started and Leon said he'd hate for the 24 hours to pass as
5602860	5609020	They'd hate to lose Clark so soon as he walked Clark out of the room the woman said goodbye to Leon
5609340	5613660	Clark turned back and and looked he recognized this woman
5614060	5618240	She was cold and vacant with a big smile on her face
5619100	5623180	her asymmetrical hair was covering one of her eyes and
5623900	5629020	Love the woman who killed Clark's parents smiled and calmly said
5629580	5636860	Bye Clark as he rushed toward her officer bishop felt another warm pinch in his neck and
5637060	5641220	Love began laughing as he slowly crumbled to the ground
5642580	5645700	Clark Bishop woke up in a cab and looking behind
5646540	5648060	He saw
5648060	5651660	He was leaving the mill on the other side of the city
5660020	5662020	I
5666180	5667940	What's up, it's Zach
5667940	5672740	I'm Zach here to give you an idea of what's going on and whatnot
5672740	5680460	so I decided it would be really helpful and nice to write a recap of season 1 so far and
5680940	5686180	Record it. So everyone is nice and caught up before we dive into the final arc of the story
5686180	5691980	I thought this would be a pretty simple task and I I thought I could encapsulate it all in in one episode
5694220	5699860	Boy howdy was was I super super wrong first I forgot how stupid I am
5700380	5705420	Second I forgot how detail oriented I can be so it's looking like this
5705980	5711320	Project has turned into a more work than I intended or have time for
5712380	5715280	But that's okay. I still think it'll be fun for everyone
5715680	5721280	Especially the players to really have a grasp on what's going down before we hit the end
5721600	5724240	So here's the deal. I I need some help
