0	6200	Y'all, I'm so fuckin' pumped. This is so fuckin' tasty.
6200	10700	Even though y'all are listening to me from 26 years in the past,
10700	19500	I know that this very special nice episode number will bring you to a delicious audio climax like it does me.
19500	22700	It's episode 69, my babies!
22700	27000	From the Station 694.2 PTBP,
27000	30500	I'm Wolf the Dog, and I'm from the future.
30500	34000	You are whoever the fuck you are from the past.
34000	35600	Let's get it, y'all.
35600	43300	Let's intertwine, like the good numbers 6 and 9, and bring each other to a new plane of existence.
43300	46500	Where pleasure is the only thing we can feel,
46500	52000	as we become one sexy oily blob together in the corners of space-time.
52000	53200	Uh...
53200	56800	So anyway, this week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Mandy.
56800	61700	At SketchyPixels, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod.
61700	62800	They write,
62800	64600	Hello, Wolf the Dog.
64600	67700	Ah, wooooo!
67700	72500	Longtime contention-based fan of the show here, and I had a question for you.
72500	76900	I don't know how much you know about tabletop games or role-playing,
76900	80700	but I'm hoping to get a regular group here in contention to play.
80700	83400	I have experience running a couple games,
83400	87900	and would love to host a new group since my last group kind of vanished.
87900	91900	I boasted around town about meeting up at the library.
91900	97200	No one's really showed up yet, and the town has seemed kind of empty lately.
97200	99100	But I'm sure it'll pick up soon.
99100	104100	Anyone interested in playing can come down to the library pretty much whenever.
104100	105800	I'm there all the time.
105800	107200	At all times.
107200	109900	Just waitin' with my dice.
109900	110900	Waiting.
110900	113000	Always waiting.
113000	117500	My question is, if you could create a character to go on an adventure,
117500	119500	what kind of character would you make?
119500	126000	I also wanted to return shout-out my very good friend Disa, who shouted me out the other day.
126000	130200	Thanks for getting me into the show and for generally being an awesome friend.
130200	132300	Thanks for writin' in, Mandy.
132300	134700	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
134700	138200	But really, what the fuck is role-playing?
138300	143100	The only role I know how to play is that of Wolf the Dog, baby.
143100	152100	He is very strong, very sexy, and very smart, and very addicted to trash can eateries.
152100	156000	If you're the kind of hoe who wants this show to grow with gusto,
156000	159800	throw us some dough and bestow your bows and crows with the no.
159800	161400	That one was a stretch.
161400	165100	And my producer definitely wrote that and made me read it,
165100	168200	or he was gonna incinerate all my trash.
168200	170300	Now, uh, we're on Patreon.
170300	175600	And please tell your friends and internet followers to listen to this damn show.
175600	178500	Goddamn, I wish I knew how to get on the internet.
178500	180300	Sounds wild, y'all.
180300	182500	Now it's time for the news.
182500	186400	Bradley Cooper found Jack Russell's go-bag in his floorboards
186400	190200	while Walter and Alan Grimes watched him on their television.
190200	194900	Roger and Angela Fairfield had a perfectly normal conversation
194900	198000	about vaccinations needed to go abroad.
198000	201700	Charles Digby had a short and confusing conversation
201700	205800	with a young girl on a walkie-talkie he found under his bed.
205800	207700	What the fuck is going on?
207700	211900	I thought this one was supposed to, you know, be like nice,
211900	214900	like calm and comfy and shit,
214900	218100	or like the good number 69.
218100	219900	I guess I don't know much,
219900	223600	but I do know universal healthcare shouldn't be divisive.
223600	225500	Sex work is work.
225500	230000	Food waste and the existence of billionaires have the same solution.
230000	235200	And this brand new track that I'm premiering here for y'all is a bit on the nose.
235200	239900	It's Dream Girl with Pretty Sexual.
239900	256900	Don't make me crazy, baby
256900	263900	This is real love dream
263900	271900	I knew I'd make you be foolish
275900	279900	There we go. Episode 69.
279900	286900	Hey, that's a sex number. It is indeed, and this is a sex episode.
286900	292900	Angela and Roger gonna fuck.
292900	294400	You told me to expect something today.
294400	298700	I didn't realize. Oh, some actual roleplay.
298700	302200	We might actually just upload a video of us like larping it.
302200	307400	If that's more appropriate for the no, that makes total sense.
307400	308500	You're cool with that, right?
308500	310800	Yeah, it'll just be in character won't be like it's me and you
310800	312100	when I signed up for this podcast.
312100	315700	I knew that there would be some light sex involved.
315700	319300	That's what the contract said that you wrote up.
319300	322100	I've changed the word light in the contract.
322100	327600	So we are going to I asked all of you guys to to come in a little
327600	330500	prepared this week, which I always feel nervous.
330500	336600	Actually, that's laughing because my eyes went wide.
336600	339100	No, I can always count on you, Joe.
339100	340400	Oh, no.
340400	343900	So what did I ask you for?
343900	345700	We're going to talk about a bad memory.
345700	350300	We are indeed and I asked you to present some sort of a first-person
350300	356500	narrative of a bad memory that is that is brought you to calm comfy
356500	357400	campground, right?
357400	359700	Yeah, it was something that related to how we got here.
359700	366000	Yeah, God my voice feels really like rough and deep right now cuz
366300	370400	this is the first while I we don't always record on Tuesday nights,
370400	374700	but pretty much always and we're doing a Saturday.
374700	375700	It's brunch time.
375700	377700	It should have been.
380400	385100	Saturday record session is going to get a little silly maybe Joe's
385100	387400	Roger Fairfield goes to sleep.
387400	393900	He drifts into a deep slumber sitting on a chair book on your chest
393900	399000	learning about the flora of the area around calm comfy campground.
399000	401200	And then hey Zach, will you tell me about some of that?
401400	402500	Yeah, there's plants.
404700	405900	What you didn't write it out.
405900	408500	You didn't talk about what all the trees were here.
408600	411000	I don't know a lot of science words.
412000	415200	There's big ones and small ones, green ones and brown ones.
415800	417300	Yeah, so far so good.
417300	417600	Cool.
417900	421600	There's a lot of flowers in that book that cover many many different
421600	425800	species and different shrubberies and bushes.
425800	430900	It's it's actually it's it's quite remarkable for the area that it
430900	431700	has plants.
434100	436800	Just how many just how many different species.
436900	447700	Yes, and so as you fall into this this sweet sweet nap night nap the
447700	451900	long night nap that you'll wake up from probably in the morning.
451900	452400	Sure.
454100	454700	Why not?
455400	458000	I would like you to just give me a rundown from a first-person
458000	461700	perspective of a bad memory that brought you here.
461700	462700	Oh shit.
462800	464500	This isn't how I thought this was going to happen.
464500	464900	Okay.
465400	465900	Okay.
465900	468100	I thought for sure I'd be talking to somebody about it.
469100	471300	You're talking to the listeners about it.
471500	473500	Well, I you know kind of hold on.
478700	479400	Sorry about that.
479400	481500	I had to just go into the kitchen.
481500	484100	I don't know if you could hear the bleed through on the mics of
484500	488500	Justin and Thomas and Luke having just a joyful conversation.
488600	490300	We don't want them having fun out there.
490300	494000	No, no fun whatsoever out there and put a kibosh on that.
494100	497700	I was so confused to find them standing all in the same room.
498900	500800	They didn't need to be that loud to hear each other.
500800	503000	It's wild so strange.
503200	503600	Okay.
503600	505400	All right, Joe Rogers having a dream.
505500	507600	Yeah, he is in the dream.
507700	508000	Yes.
508100	510100	He oh you said first person.
510300	516800	I I'm dreaming of I'm dreaming of my time before I met Angela.
516800	521400	It's I'm in a classroom and I'm doing my notes and I'm going home
521400	525600	and studying and I'm reading my textbooks and I'm falling asleep
525600	528500	and I'm waking up and I'm going to the gym and I'm going to class
528500	532300	and I'm going home and studying and I'm falling asleep in just
532300	534300	one day on the way to class.
534400	538700	I ran into this girl and I mean ran into her.
539300	542500	She stopped me in my tracks because she was looking down and
542500	545900	I was looking up and boom and her bracelet went flying and
545900	549300	my glasses flew off and I gathered all those things up and
549300	550900	she put the glasses on my face.
551000	555400	I something about something about her face that I didn't go
555400	556100	to class that day.
556100	560200	I asked her to go get a cup of coffee with me meet you make
560200	562900	you we were kind of inseparable after that.
562900	566500	We she was she was not like me at all.
566600	570200	If she saw a cool car, she would run over and ask the person
570200	570800	in the parking lot.
570800	575000	If it was theirs and talk to them about it and I would not
575000	575300	do that.
575300	577800	That's not something I would ever have done just talking
577800	579800	to strangers talking to strangers at all.
581300	583300	But it's just because I wasn't that interested but she's
583300	583800	interested.
583800	585700	She's she's interested in everything.
585700	587300	It's she's always asking stuff.
587300	589000	She's always asking about my life.
589000	592900	She's asking about my work and I don't like to talk about
592900	593700	that very often.
593800	594500	I don't know.
594800	597200	I'm an archaeologist and I feel like everybody would find
597200	597700	that boring.
597700	600300	I don't like to talk about my work because I see eyes glaze
600300	602300	over but she would always ask and I would go and tell her
602300	603800	what I could so Raj.
603800	606000	What what did you what are you working on today?
606000	609600	I mean, it's just old dusty bricks out to yeah, but they're
609600	613000	your dusty bricks and I want to know about your dusty bricks.
613400	618300	I mean, it's not we found we found a we found a city we
618300	621600	found a city a city a whole city.
622200	622900	Oh my God.
622900	626100	That's like a big deal or I don't have to feign interest.
626200	628100	It's just I'm interested.
628900	629300	Really?
629400	629900	Of course.
629900	630300	I am.
630300	631700	It's it's our life.
631800	632800	It is it's cool.
632800	633300	It's an old.
633300	635500	It's an old old city that nobody's seen it before.
635500	636300	What's it called?
636500	638400	We're just calling it the nameless city right now.
638400	640200	We don't really have a term for it.
640200	641200	That's spooky.
641300	645100	It's it's neat as you're reliving this moment with Angela.
645400	648100	She freezes completely.
649700	654300	And you notice that the air is stagnant around you no more
654300	657900	sound you'd heard birds chirping second ago.
658300	659500	They're no longer chirping.
659500	662900	You heard a car was literally driving by at that exact moment.
663900	668000	He kind of clants out the window and it is stopped in the
668000	672800	middle of the road and walking into the room is a man with
672800	677200	black dress shoes gray slacks and a white shirt.
678400	682900	It's James the executive director of calm comfy campground.
683600	689300	So Roger, what would you want to change in this moment?
689600	693500	If you could go back it was it wasn't it wasn't that moment
693500	695800	that that that moment was was nice.
695800	699000	It was it was all the times after that that she she just
699000	703400	kept asking kept asking kept trying to tell me have me tell
703400	705600	her more it became exhausting.
705600	708500	I couldn't I didn't I didn't my work is my work.
708500	711000	I don't I don't want to have to relay my notes every night
711000	711500	to her.
712700	714700	I would get I would get snippy sometimes when she would ask
714700	718300	about my work and one night I yelled at her.
718700	723600	Let's go there and he snaps his fingers and he's gone and
723600	727500	you are where were you when this took place laying in bed
728300	728700	hot.
731400	733200	We laying in our separate beds.
737400	737700	Yeah.
737700	739500	Well, it's 26 years ago.
739500	742200	Obviously, I love Lucy style bedroom.
742200	742500	Yeah.
742500	742800	Yeah.
744600	748500	Okay, but like just I mean any like a single detail like a
748500	749300	single detail.
749300	751200	We don't it's dusty.
751200	753500	It's dusty and there's rocks and sometimes.
753600	757100	There's writing on the fucking rocks Angela and she just
757100	760900	looks at you with these big eyes and you see a little bit
760900	764000	of the light just die in them.
765500	770600	Life freezes once again and James walks into the room.
770900	773000	So that wasn't great.
773100	775600	No, it's not fun to see it again.
776200	779400	Do you think that there was anything else leading to this
779400	783500	or was it just a repetition that led you down this aggressive
783500	784100	pathway?
784200	788200	I mean, she's just she's just so so different from the way
788200	791600	I used to live every everything about her is the antithesis
791600	792000	of me.
792700	796200	She likes to do things and I do the same things.
802900	805200	Oh, I thought of something really cool to say in this voice
805400	807700	in the shower last night and I practiced it.
808700	809800	But I don't remember what it was.
809800	810500	Oh, man.
810500	812700	I literally I think it was just calling somebody a chump.
814500	816700	I'm just picture you in the shower.
817300	819100	I think it was shut it jump.
822000	822600	I thought of that.
822600	823800	I was like, that's actually hilarious.
824800	828400	Your body wash is like ball episode 69 Thomas.
828400	829400	That's the sex number.
830700	832900	That's my second name and favorite number after the drug
832900	833300	number.
835400	837400	Oh, you prefer the drug number?
837400	837600	Yeah.
838500	839400	Yeah me too.
839500	844900	69 is like a great concept, but it's not honestly like it's
844900	846000	too distracting.
846000	847400	You can't focus on the pleasure.
847400	848900	You're giving.
848900	850700	Okay, we went different directions.
851500	854800	So well because it's the same thing you can't focus on the
854800	856600	pleasure you're getting because you're focused on the pleasure
856600	858800	you're giving I tend to focus on the pleasure.
858800	859600	I'm giving Zach.
859600	862900	So that's well, that's what I was trying to believe on.
865600	868600	All right, so I we went over this with Joe but I asked you
868700	873900	guys to to be able to relay a bad memory in first person.
873900	879200	And so we're just going to jump right on in as you fall asleep
879300	884000	in your very nice pajamas silken high-thread count jammies.
885400	888300	Your mind goes blank for the first time all day.
889700	895400	Not thinking about Cube not thinking about shades of white.
895400	897100	That's such an ignorant thing to say.
897100	898500	Well, I'm an ignorant boy.
898800	902600	I could show you color palettes that would blow your mind.
904200	907100	I had a friend he considered me a friend.
907500	911700	I didn't necessarily treat him like much of one but we met
911800	912900	after college.
913300	915500	This was 26 years ago.
915500	918000	Not not like the 26 years ago.
918000	920200	We might hypothetically be living in now.
921600	926900	This was actually 26 years ago and it was a time for technology.
927600	932700	We were just some California kids out there me Martin Cupertino
933400	935400	and Bill Bosniak.
936700	940200	You know a lot, you know a lot more technically than I did
941100	944100	and and we dreamed of building something big together.
944500	948500	I was working for for a video game company called Campari.
948800	951300	They came to us with a challenge if you could remove as
951300	955300	many chips as possible from from the circuit board for their
955700	959500	for the new video game, they would give you $50 a chip.
959500	961200	No a hundred dollars a chip.
961500	961900	I swear.
961900	965800	I just read the Wikipedia on this so I know what I'm talking
965800	970300	about. Wikipedia is a thing that will exist 26 years in the
970300	974100	future, which is where I consider myself to be existing at
974100	976000	all times spiritually.
976400	980600	So Bill I knew he could he could take a crack at it.
980600	983700	He could he could whittle down the chips on that circuit board
984200	987200	where I couldn't and I promised him we'd split the reward
987300	990900	evenly. He came back to me a few weeks later having removed
990900	991800	50 chips.
992200	995800	That's $5,000 in 26 years ago money.
996100	997700	That was a lot of money at the time.
997900	999800	I took his design to Campari.
1000400	1005200	They gave me the $5,000 and I told Bill that they had only
1005200	1006700	given us $700.
1007400	1009400	I gave him $350.
1010900	1011800	And it haunts me.
1012800	1015400	Wait $700.
1015900	1019200	I thought we were supposed to get wasn't it was a hundred
1019200	1020500	dollars a chip, right?
1022300	1023500	This is I'm Bill.
1024900	1028500	Noted California technologist Bill Bosniak.
1028500	1032300	Bill Bosniak here love California.
1037800	1038900	That that pans.
1039900	1042800	Yeah, so Bill they they kind of fucked us.
1042800	1046200	I mean you did great work buddy, but they didn't give us
1046200	1047500	the full 5,000.
1047500	1048900	They only gave us $700.
1048900	1053700	So here's your 350 big guy and at that exact moment life
1053700	1059700	freezes Bill's face like it's been paused and walking into
1059700	1065000	the room is a man in a white dress shirt gray slacks and
1065000	1066300	black dress shoes.
1066500	1070300	And it's James the executive director of calm comfy campground.
1071000	1077300	So Bradley or should I say Martin if you could I fooled
1077300	1082200	you if you could go back to this moment and you could change
1082200	1082900	anything.
1083500	1085700	I've thought about that a lot.
1085900	1088800	Would you yeah, I'd tell him they didn't pay us anything
1089100	1090600	and keep all the money for myself.
1091100	1093900	I use that to start our company the stock options.
1093900	1096500	He got from that alone more than made up for it.
1097500	1101700	I mean if I had had 350 extra bucks to put into that 26
1101700	1102300	years ago.
1103500	1106400	That might be worth two or three points, you know on the
1106400	1107400	stock these days.
1108200	1111400	That's a few more million dollars for him for old Bill is
1111400	1114300	the regret of not being able to get your friend more money
1114500	1115100	later.
1115400	1118600	I made my friend a very wealthy man not as wealthy as he
1118600	1122600	might have been if I was honest with him over the 15 years
1122600	1124300	or so of our professional Association.
1125600	1126800	I've thought about both ways.
1126800	1129000	What if I gave him his full amount?
1129500	1132800	What if I gave him nothing neither option seems satisfactory?
1133100	1134800	I wouldn't be where I was today without it.
1135400	1136700	I guess I regret nothing.
1137800	1139000	This place really works.
1148100	1149800	I want this is Joe's.
1149900	1152100	Yeah, it's just nice bag.
1152100	1152900	Not anymore.
1154200	1159000	I just put my dice in my dice bag now tell Joe anything
1159000	1160500	totally my dice bag.
1161100	1163500	Hello, Justin.
1163800	1167300	Well, hello, Justin.
1168000	1169200	It's so nice to see you.
1169200	1170700	I forgot the rest of the Hello Dolly.
1170700	1171600	I don't know the words.
1173000	1174800	You said the ones I know.
1174800	1175100	Yep.
1175100	1178800	Those are the ones it's so something something something.
1178800	1179300	Yeah.
1179300	1180000	Hello Dolly.
1180000	1180700	Hello Dolly.
1181700	1182900	You're my Dolly.
1182900	1190200	Oh, you're my Louis Armstrong Louis Louis Louis Louis when
1190200	1195500	I'm wearing my formal attire, I am Louis and this the sweaters
1195500	1199400	obviously so Justin it's episode 69.
1199400	1201300	Oh, I forgot about that.
1201300	1203300	Yeah, I don't think it might have a celebrated it.
1204800	1207800	The best number we should have started episode 1 with like
1207800	1214400	this is the countdown to episode 69 I asked you to have a
1214400	1217900	bad memory prepared and we're going to dive into it as you
1217900	1223800	fall asleep caffeine riddled mind racing, but tuckered out
1223800	1227000	from a long day at calm comfy campground you get into bed
1227000	1231400	after having a less than normal experience with a walkie-talkie
1231400	1232200	under your bed.
1232200	1236300	Yeah, that was unsettling but it is on your nightstand as
1236300	1237000	you sleep.
1237000	1240300	Yeah, but not not unsettling enough that I don't leave it
1240300	1245200	on right next to your glutton for unsettlement.
1245200	1250700	Come on, baby as you drift asleep your mind opens back up
1251000	1254600	and you find yourself amidst this memory.
1254900	1260400	So when we first got together Sam was everything to me.
1261300	1264600	She warmed my heart in a way that no one else had since I
1264600	1266600	was like a teenager or something.
1266800	1269700	I don't think I've ever known a love like that in my entire
1269700	1273600	life that made me want to cling to her all the harder.
1274600	1279400	We had these matching coffee cups each with the first letter
1279400	1280600	of our first names.
1280800	1283000	It was one of the first things we bought when we first moved
1283000	1286200	in together after our first year of living with each other.
1286200	1291100	I started noticing some things it's in my nature to pick
1291100	1293900	up on other people's routines and whatnot.
1294100	1297200	I noticed that she was running late from work more often.
1297400	1299200	I told myself it was all fine.
1299300	1302300	It'd be okay me and Rolo had the place to ourselves every
1302300	1306300	now and then boys night in and all that Taco Tuesday with
1306300	1307400	Rolo. Sure.
1307400	1308100	Why not?
1308500	1310900	She would tell me about these happy hour things with her
1310900	1311500	co-workers.
1311500	1315300	It was helping her network move up the ladder all that stuff
1315300	1316300	a couple nights.
1316500	1317900	She would get home real late.
1318100	1321300	Then it started to spread to some weekend nights this drifted
1321300	1322500	on for about a month.
1322600	1325000	So I did what I'm good at.
1325100	1327200	I started tailing her.
1327900	1331500	I took some pictures of her with her friends co-workers whoever
1331500	1334400	she was with I started keeping a folder with pictures and
1334400	1337200	names to see if they matched with people from work like she
1337200	1341900	had told me so one night I get a call from a client and I
1341900	1344900	have to storm off somewhere to capture some pictures of someone
1344900	1346200	in a timely manner.
1346600	1352400	I get back home real late that night Sam is she's on the floor
1352900	1356700	crying but furious looking at the pictures of her and her
1356700	1360300	peers that I had taken my heart nearly stopped.
1360800	1363600	I just about projectile vomit from the nerves.
1364200	1366400	Everything was a fucking mess.
1366800	1370400	I remember in this moment looking at my overweight cat Rolo
1370600	1373900	and I could see in his eyes this feeling of like holy shit
1373900	1375200	you fucked up guy.
1375700	1377400	She yells at me now.
1377400	1382400	I'm used to being yelled at my job doesn't always elicit joy
1382500	1385500	from others, but this felt like the wrath of some kind of
1385500	1389900	cruel dark God was coming my way her raised voice pierced
1389900	1390700	my soul.
1391100	1394200	I try to tell her that I was just worried about how she'd
1394200	1396100	been spending more time away from me.
1396300	1399600	I was just concerned about her really honest, but she could
1399600	1401200	see right through my bullshit.
1401600	1405300	She knew it was because I didn't trust her deep down that
1405300	1407300	I have trouble trusting anyone.
1408200	1411600	She said exactly that to me and I denied it.
1412300	1413500	I get defensive.
1413700	1416000	I start running down all the things I had seen her doing
1416000	1419400	at what times and where I told her that I had a reason not
1419400	1420200	to trust her.
1420800	1425800	That's when she threw her coffee cup down on the floor next
1425800	1427600	to all those fucking pictures.
1428500	1430800	She started packing up her stuff in a hurry.
1430900	1434600	She was out of there so fast the next morning.
1435200	1439700	Just me my obese cat and one half of a matching set of coffee
1439700	1443200	cups and those goddamn pictures that I never should have
1443200	1447800	taken and as Charles Digby is staring down at these pictures
1448900	1454400	the world stops like someone paused the television.
1455500	1459800	That morning you could hear the birds chirping dogs playing
1459800	1461400	outside in the neighborhood.
1461800	1464200	You could hear the city streets.
1465200	1469700	But all of that is now completely silent and stepping into
1469700	1474300	the room is a man wearing a white button-down shirt gray
1474300	1478500	slacks and black dress shoes and it's James the executive
1478500	1481000	director at calm comfy campground.
1481500	1484600	So that was pretty rough.
1485900	1490300	Now if you if you could talk to this version of yourself
1490300	1492700	right here, what would you say to him?
1492900	1495800	I'd yell at him and say what what have you done?
1496100	1499600	You've ruined one of the best things you've ever had going
1499600	1500500	in your life.
1500500	1501800	You fucking fool.
1501800	1505600	You're no longer standing over these pictures, but you're
1505600	1509900	standing in your workroom your office holding your camera
1509900	1514000	about to go out and tail Sam for the first time and you can
1514000	1515600	see the look on your own face.
1515800	1520700	And again everything pauses and James steps up now if you
1520700	1523000	had the opportunity, would you change it?
1523100	1527000	I absolutely would I would I would do anything to undo what
1527000	1529200	I did take the camera out of his hands.
1529400	1532200	I died put my hands on the camera and yank it out and a
1532200	1534000	wrestle it away from yourself.
1534100	1535200	Yeah, is he like really stiff?
1535200	1535600	Yeah.
1535700	1538000	Yeah got that rigor mortis.
1539200	1543000	Yeah, I'm like just like take it out like really fucking
1543300	1544400	feisty angry.
1544500	1545200	That's good.
1545600	1546200	It's good.
1546500	1546600	Now.
1546600	1548000	What would you have to do?
1548300	1552400	What would you have to explain to this version of yourself
1552900	1555900	in order to keep you from doing this again?
1556100	1557100	You got to trust people.
1557100	1561700	You can't just assume the worst in everybody even though
1561700	1563900	that's your that's your day job.
1564400	1566700	You can't do that with the people you love you have to
1566700	1570000	assume the best out of the people you love.
1575200	1576200	Luke in the room.
1576400	1577500	I'm here, baby.
1579000	1582500	Are you ready for episode 69?
1584000	1585400	I've never been more ready.
1586300	1590100	That means we've been doing this for like a long time like
1590100	1592200	I'm like a couple months.
1593400	1598400	So Walter Grimes turns his chin down to his chest and those
1598400	1604000	piercing blue baby eyes clothes or turn dark.
1605000	1613200	Yeah, I'm in my room laying in bed looking at book not
1613200	1617000	really reading it or taking it in just kind of staring
1617000	1622900	and Alan walks into the room and he's in a bit of a huff
1623200	1628900	and he comes over to me and I hear noises from another
1628900	1631300	room and he doesn't say anything.
1631300	1635300	He just comes over and he places his finger underneath
1635300	1640800	my chin and everything goes dark, but I'm not off.
1641200	1642300	I can't move.
1642600	1647800	I can't see but I can still hear the voices get closer
1647800	1653300	and I hear Alan talk about selling me.
1653600	1658700	I hear two men enter the room and I can feel them touching
1658700	1663200	me and I feel their presence and I can tell they're looking
1663500	1668900	me over and inspecting different parts of my body and Alan
1669100	1675500	keep saying numbers and they are negotiating about how much
1675500	1680400	I'm worth and at the end of it Alan he tells them to leave
1680500	1685400	and he turns me back on and he asked if I'm okay is everything
1685400	1691000	okay Walter and he acts like nothing happened and I yeah,
1691200	1696700	I don't ask him about it, but it's the first time I realized
1696700	1701600	that I consider Alan my father, but I don't know if he considers
1701600	1705800	me his son and at that exact moment Walters face freezes
1706100	1711200	like it's been paused almost like he's been turned off but
1711200	1715300	you notice that the ceiling fan in the room that was on previous
1715400	1719200	is just frozen in the air above you and at that moment the
1719200	1723500	door opens and a man walks in he's wearing white button-down
1723500	1729200	shirt gray slacks and black shoes and it is James the executive
1729200	1731500	director at calm comfy campground.
1732000	1737100	So Walter, why did you tell him everything was okay?
1737300	1739400	Everything is okay.
1739700	1742800	Do you actually believe that it's what I've been told do you
1742800	1746900	have thoughts that aren't what you've been told?
1747100	1747500	Yes.
1748100	1752400	I try not to think about them like what mostly bad things.
1752900	1753900	I'm not real.
1754300	1758300	I mean I am real but not in the way that you are.
1758700	1761500	I mean, I'm here talking to you.
1762200	1763600	We're in one of your memories.
1763600	1765000	You seem real to me.
1765200	1765600	Okay.
1766200	1771800	So if you're not real to you, what does that make you feel inferior?
1772200	1774500	Do you worry about that sometimes?
1774500	1781100	Yes, when I'm trying to learn more and read sometimes I don't
1781100	1783900	actually read and I ruminate on bad thoughts.
1784000	1788700	Is it your goal to get rid of this inferior feeling that would
1788700	1789200	be nice.
1789200	1792000	Yes, and how do you intend to achieve that goal?
1792500	1794200	I don't think about it often.
1795100	1796900	So I haven't thought that far ahead.
1797000	1798300	Do you think it's possible?
1799700	1800900	Anything is possible.
1802800	1809800	I'm going to combat Thomas's character with deep gravel boys.
1811000	1814200	Nice try bees the deep gravelly boys.
1814200	1815800	Ooh, I do like that.
1817400	1818600	Did you be DJ me?
1818600	1820700	Did you be fair to be a part of that group?
1820700	1821000	Alan?
1821000	1823500	You gotta go and go fuck yourself.
1824300	1825400	Fuck off Nixon.
1825900	1827500	Well before them, I'm part of a girl.
1829000	1829600	Yeah, me too.
1829600	1833500	But I'm probably crying because I'm friends with everybody.
1834700	1838200	What could you not understand me?
1843800	1844600	Oh, I'm Alan.
1844600	1845100	Fuck.
1846100	1847000	Yeah, you keep doing it.
1847000	1847700	Fuck.
1848000	1849200	My name is Alan.
1849200	1849900	Fuck.
1850200	1851400	That's my favorite RnB.
1853200	1853800	Oh my God.
1853800	1857000	That would be such a fucking good name for a musician.
1857000	1857900	His son Robin.
1857900	1858800	Fuck Robin.
1858800	1859300	Fuck it.
1859300	1860900	Yeah, he's done.
1860900	1861500	He's over.
1861700	1862900	All right, you guys ready for this?

1955300	1958900	you in the back because of your just innate athleticism
1958900	1962700	and you are side to side side to side just paddling paddling
1962700	1967200	so smooth into these dark waters and you are flying towards

2035200	2037900	and a number they're grouped together five to seven people

2148600	2154400	So you guys find a shelf that has the same name over and
2154400	2158500	over and over on every tape hundreds is it Jack Russell
2158500	2162300	and it's Jack Russell the next shelf over has even more tapes
2162300	2163400	with the same name.
2163500	2166500	This was where I was going to say Jack Russell, right?
2166500	2169800	Yeah, if I had to guess I'd say there's about five or four
2169800	2172900	missing and I pulled them out of my pockets when you reach
2172900	2173800	into your pockets.
2173800	2177000	They're not there damn and you see then the numbers that
2177000	2180000	you think should be there are in the shelf.
2180100	2181300	Well funny story guys.
2181500	2184300	I've seen these tapes before they were hidden in my room
2184700	2188300	along with what seemed like basically some some get out
2188300	2192200	and go shit the Jack had do our characters have any
2192400	2194500	feeling about suddenly being here.
2194500	2197400	Do we are we aware that this all of a sudden has happened
2197400	2198900	that we have happened to do this place.
2198900	2203300	This feels like a memory that is happening in the future
2203300	2204700	and you're living it now.
2205100	2205700	Wow.
2206000	2206400	Okay.
2207200	2209500	Did you did you get a chance to look at the tapes?
2209500	2210200	What's on the tapes?
2210200	2212500	No, I couldn't find the weird metallic again.
2212500	2215200	I figured he might have a Walkman there wasn't really one
2215200	2216200	around anywhere else.
2216200	2218100	Don't talk about my son ever again.
2218200	2221100	What else was in the go bag two things don't talk to my
2221100	2222600	son ever again and what's in the go back.
2222800	2225300	I saw you tell your father not to talk to me kid.
2225400	2226900	I saw get on my nerves.
2226900	2228800	You had a map in the bag.
2228900	2230400	Yeah, I saw that.
2230400	2233100	How'd you see that your cabins on our TV?
2233200	2236600	We were changing the channels on the TV and we saw the inside
2236600	2237400	of your cabin.
2237500	2238600	That's a gross invasion.
2239000	2243000	Did you see anything related to the proprietary development
2243000	2245900	of Cube Walter now and look at each other with wide eyes
2245900	2247600	like Luke and Zach are doing right now.
2248100	2250500	No, no, no good good.
2250500	2251900	You've never heard of Cube.
2252600	2254300	You wouldn't understand it if you saw it.
2254300	2254800	What now?
2254800	2255900	Let's shut up.
2255900	2260200	What's at the northeast part of the map the door explain
2260200	2260800	the door.
2260800	2264100	It just says the door where on the map the northeast side
2264100	2265400	Roger raises his hand.
2265400	2266800	I'm playing catch up here.
2266800	2268400	What what's going on?
2268500	2272600	He pointed at the northeast part of the map on on our TV.
2272700	2273700	Yeah, what was the map?
2273700	2277700	The map is a map of this place come comfy campgrounds looked
2277700	2279800	like maybe Jack had written it up.
2280000	2283500	He marked a trail that led out of here to the door.
2283500	2286700	Are we sure we're in calm comfy campgrounds right now?
2288900	2290400	Everyone looks at each other.
2290900	2292300	How rustic is this room?
2295300	2299500	It is neither rustic nor elegant for these tapes video tapes
2299500	2301100	or cassette audio cassette.
2301100	2301600	Okay.
2301600	2304400	Is there a tape player in here looking around you just see
2304400	2307600	shelves shelves and shelves and shelves Alan when you were
2307700	2308700	looking through your TV.
2308700	2311100	Did you see an image of the woods?
2311600	2312600	I don't believe so.
2312600	2317300	No, no, we watched Wheel of Fortune for one clue and then
2317300	2319900	we what was the clue beer-battered shrimp?
2323000	2323500	Excuse me.
2323500	2325500	It was beer-battered rock shrimp.
2325500	2326100	There it is.
2327600	2328800	It's very important to the plot.
2328800	2332700	So I just thought it might be the episode that in the that
2332700	2333300	would have been cool.
2333400	2337300	Yeah, kind of kind of insane.
2337300	2338000	You didn't do that.
2339100	2340200	It was just Luke's improv.
2340200	2342800	So don't well, I had watched well looks a bad deal.
2343800	2347400	I had watched Wheel of Fortune and that was one of the clues
2347400	2350600	in my mind beer-battered rock shrimp.
2350600	2353000	Yeah, that sounds good.
2353000	2354600	It does Alan.
2355000	2358200	How many other cameras do you think you saw on the TV?
2358700	2360300	We turned it off.
2360300	2361300	So just the one.
2361400	2361800	Yeah.
2362200	2362600	Okay.
2362800	2366100	I saw a camera in the forest whenever I was doing a little
2366700	2368000	investigating.
2368000	2368700	Let's call it.
2368700	2371500	Can you elaborate on your investigation?
2371800	2375600	That was just, you know, wandering about looking for stuff.
2375700	2376700	You saw a camera?
2376800	2378000	There was a camera up in a tree.
2378000	2381300	I couldn't get up to it though, but I was curious why it
2381300	2381600	was there.
2381600	2384600	I thought maybe it was to look out for wild animals or
2384600	2385100	something.
2385100	2388000	But if it's in one of our rooms, it could have been in all
2388000	2388900	of our rooms.
2389000	2392400	I didn't even notice that I had a TV.
2392400	2394600	I don't own a TV at home.
2395300	2396100	Very cool.
2396900	2397500	Wow.
2398500	2399600	I want to be friends with you.
2401700	2402800	Full, I'm full.
2403900	2405100	All my spots are full.
2405400	2408200	Listen, while we're talking about what we did while we were
2408200	2409000	exploring.
2409200	2411700	I took a canoe out alone on the lake.
2411700	2413400	But we're not supposed to do that.
2413400	2414600	I can handle it.
2414800	2415200	Okay.
2416400	2417800	There's some kind of lake monster.
2417800	2418400	That's all.
2418400	2423300	Of a lake a lake monster.
2423400	2425100	Yeah, some creature in the lake.
2425100	2426200	Did you see it?
2426300	2426900	I heard it.
2426900	2429900	I saw its form underwater is Jack in the room with us, right?
2429900	2433800	Jack is not and Alan Grimes speaks up and is like but but
2433800	2435900	Jack said that there aren't fish in the lake.
2435900	2437300	Yeah, probably cuz this thing ate him.
2440300	2443500	Charles Digby gets or maybe so we didn't catch this thing.
2443500	2445800	He gets a little no-putt out and does a little some little
2445800	2448200	Scribbies Zach just smiled like I was right.
2448200	2449700	We need to go fishing for a fish man.
2452100	2453600	Is a is Angela in the room?
2453600	2454700	No, hmm.
2455300	2459500	Wait, where's Angela?
2459600	2460500	Where's your wife?
2460500	2462800	She's probably smoking a joint because she's cool Angela.
2462800	2463300	She's right.
2464000	2467400	Oh and it and Angie Angie.
2467400	2469100	How many tapes have Angela written on them?
2469200	2473700	You guys actually immediately thereafter stumble upon a group.
2473700	2478900	The names are Charles Digby Roger Fairfield Alan Grimes
2479100	2481900	Walter Grimes and Martin Cupertino.
2483100	2484600	How many of each of those names?
2486100	2487200	More than four.
2487300	2489500	Did you say there was hundreds with Jack Russell?
2489600	2490100	Yeah.
2490200	2492900	Yeah, the ones in my cabin were like from the 580s.
2493000	2495400	Wow, your group has maybe 12.
2495400	2497800	Well, it seems like we've been repeating this experience for
2497900	2500900	not as long as say poor Jack Russell.
2501300	2503600	What do you what do you mean repeat repeating?
2503600	2504100	What is that?
2504200	2506100	I mean, doesn't that seem like what's going on here?
2506200	2507500	Have you been here before?
2507700	2509700	Haven't we look we've been here 12 times.
2509800	2511000	How did you come to that?
2511000	2513300	Why would that be a thing that you think of?
2513500	2516100	I mean remember like just a second ago when we were all
2516100	2518500	running for our lives in the canoe and then a second before
2518500	2520200	that when we were here at our first day.
2520300	2521500	Is that how it would feel to us?
2521600	2524400	All the memories are starting to just swirl together.
2524500	2525600	I remember the boats of Charles.
2525600	2526700	We were in a boat together.
2526700	2530600	That was yeah, I think was that that did I mean that happened?
2530700	2533500	I remember I think I remember remember I did it.
2533600	2536400	I don't know Charles Digby is very fucked up right now.
2537400	2538400	It doesn't make sense.
2538900	2539700	Look at look at the tapes.
2539700	2540700	There's a Martin here.
2540700	2542400	Who's who's Martin Cupertino?
2545900	2547200	I'm Martin Cupertino.

2564200	2567400	I think everyone would Oh ever used email.
2573200	2574200	I've heard of this.
2574700	2577200	Yeah, it sounds very futuristic.
2577300	2580700	It's very lucrative as are the other things my company develops
2581100	2583700	but wait, why did you tell us that your name was Bradley Cooper?
2583700	2586500	I don't I'm a celebrity at a health resort.
2586500	2591300	I was trying to pick a non-famous inconspicuous name.
2594000	2597000	And Bradley Cooper seems like a pretty standard, you know,
2597000	2599800	boring white guys name for boring definitely mid-90s.
2599800	2601000	Very boring picked a great name.

2604600	2609000	I think I think he's charming but yeah, maybe he's a little
2609000	2610200	limited in his range.
2614800	2616000	But he does what he does.
2616400	2616700	Right.

2646400	2650500	Yeah, well, it'll do that but email to and other things spreadsheets.
2650900	2653100	Yeah, you know what a personal computer is, right?
2653300	2653700	Yeah.
2653900	2656800	This is that but it looks like a jellybean kind of it's real
2656800	2657500	fanciful.
2657800	2658500	Can it fax?
2659500	2660600	No, that's a fax machine.
2660800	2664800	Oh dang, so it doesn't do everything.
2665500	2669100	It doesn't do what is no longer needed.
2669100	2673700	Listen, if people would adapt to do Technologies when they
2673700	2677800	come out, we wouldn't be burdened with this inefficiency
2677900	2680900	that plagues our system people would get things done.
2680900	2683800	They would have the answers to all of life's problems in
2683800	2684700	their hands.
2684900	2686100	That's why I'm here.
2686300	2690100	I'm trying to figure this out for all of you fucking people
2690100	2694600	in this world, but if it can't fax, I mean speaking of Technologies
2694600	2699900	is adopting Luke roll luck on a 50 to see if you have a cassette
2699900	2701700	Walkman with I don't bummer town.
2701700	2702500	That would have been fun.
2704100	2708500	I I go over to Alan and whisper in his ear.

2725800	2727000	He's a weird machine boy.
2727200	2729000	No, yeah, I whispered that in his ear.
2729000	2729900	She didn't hear it.

2757100	2757900	He's not a boy.
2758000	2759200	He's a mechanical boy.
2759900	2767500	So Roger at not having heard the whisper mechanical boy.
2767500	2772300	What my start I start like looking you up and down and
2772300	2778300	I'm like we have to integrate this into Cube my Walter's
2778300	2782600	face looks like it's crying but oil comes out.
2782600	2782800	Yeah.
2784100	2786300	No, it's just this nothing sailing solution.

2789800	2790300	Try cry.
2790300	2791300	I'm trying to hide it.
2791700	2792900	But is it ugly?
2792900	2795000	Well Walter, you could be the most important boy on the
2795000	2799300	face of this planet Solomon and quite feel a little bad.

2808700	2809900	We need to figure this out.
2810000	2811400	I just want to know where my wife is.
2811400	2813300	I Angela's name was not in our batch, right?
2813400	2816100	It was not not in the budget are collected tapes.
2816100	2816800	That is correct.
2817800	2819900	Hey Angela's name isn't here.

2837400	2841200	has two full shelves like all to himself standing next to
2841200	2844000	each other but then past that it's all the same as normal
2844000	2845800	but I was getting at it since our names are all grouped
2845800	2846400	together.
2846500	2848600	I wondered if he was grouped together with somebody that
2848600	2851200	he is close to or something seemingly not.
