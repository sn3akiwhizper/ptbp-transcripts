0	5200	Yesterday, I ate a whole bucket of long-deceased crab.
5200	11500	Now y'all know I like to dive right into a slop bucket, putrid or otherwise, but something
11500	16120	about these weird ocean spiders got me feeling nasty.
16120	22400	But not Wolf the dog nasty, just regular diarrhea nasty.
23000	32600	What does not make me feel nasty is broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station
32600	40120	that is also in the past and the present and the future at all times, but also sometimes
40120	41740	none of them.
41740	44520	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Daisy.
44520	49240	If you want to write up something for y'all wolfy to howl, tag the show at Pretending
49240	55800	Pod on Instagram or Twitter, or write up a 5-star review on Apple Podcasts and email
55800	59320	us at PretendingPod at Gmail dot com.
59320	61640	That way you can be like Daisy here.
61640	66600	They write, Hello to everyone in contention and beyond.
66600	72440	Thanks to the weird time stuff going on in contention, Texas has gotten a signal to y'all's
72440	78400	best and only radio station, 694.2 PTBP.
78400	83840	I've been listening for a month or has it only been a few days?
83840	86200	Contention is so weird with its time.
86200	92780	Well, I would just like to take this time to say thank you to Wolf the dog, his producer
92780	96840	and all the people who make this radio segment possible.
96840	101480	Sincerely, Daisy, sending all the love and trash in Texas.
101480	103440	Well, damn, thanks Daisy.
103440	109980	Well, uh, you can keep the love, but I will gladly take your trash offering with glee.
109980	115500	Also remember, we've got a new project for our citizens of contention over on the subreddit.
115500	119520	We are going to write a Delta Green scenario as a community.
119520	124640	Over the next few months, we'll be having prompted writing contests to find the best
124640	126760	meaty chunks y'all can muster.
126760	132280	We'll use each round's winner to inform the next prompt until we have enough juicy morsels
132280	134740	to make ourselves a narrative feast.
134740	140660	To get in on this tub of greasy love, head on down to reddit.com all slash pretending
140660	141920	to be people.
141920	146660	The deadline for submissions here in round one is August 22nd.
146660	151680	Show us what you've got and vote for your favorites to help us choose the winners.
151680	156820	Hey lovers, did you enjoy that bonus episode we released a couple weeks ago?
156820	162480	The one where the boys played Lover in the Ice, the infamously mad fucked up Delta Green
162480	165180	scenario written by Caleb Stokes?
165180	169240	Well, that was just part one of a three part series.
169240	174940	You can find parts two and three over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.
174940	176700	There's a link in the show notes.
176700	182300	As you become a Splashylvania Fastpass holder, you'll have access to our entire playthrough
182300	187380	of Lover in the Ice as well as 10 other bonus episodes.
187380	193740	Wherein we play everyone is John the End of the World, Magnum Vice, Fury Force, more Delta
193740	198460	Green, and Kala Cthulhu's original scenario, The Haunting.
198460	204260	You can also listen to the session zero for season one, during which the boys create the
204260	208200	town of contention and discuss character ideas.
208200	214240	And uh, next up on the Patreon docket, some fucking human named Justin is running roll
214240	220280	for shoes in the Den of Sin, August 29th at 7pm central time.
220280	224620	Again, hit that link in the damn show notes, why don't ya?
224620	229700	Speaking of notes, mine here in front of me are all dusty, but I'm pretty sure they say
229700	232900	it's time for the news.
232900	237720	Last time we learned a little about all the good Silas and Mary Cole are doing as the
237760	245080	head honchos here in contention in 1880 something, and then we met four fresh faces of four fine
245080	249400	folks whose lives are about to be turned completely upside down.
249400	255560	Everett Pace, a wily old coot, was lurking around his homestead when he heard a noise
255560	257880	out by his late wife's grave.
257880	263320	Hollering, he ran off the missing Miss Kitty, who was digging with her hands over the burial
263320	265800	site while mumbling to herself.
266120	273640	Jack Pearlman, oh, after overhearing some folks at the saloon spilling tea about Silas
273640	279040	having a teenage girl out on the property of the new mine, trotted home to find one
279040	284960	of his steeds on the edge of the river Styx while a slight humanoid figure bolted toward
284960	287760	the tree line like a wild animal.
287760	293960	Professor Horace Green tried to get some shut eye, but the drunken miner's conversation
293960	297200	next door bled through the walls like lace.
297200	302480	He couldn't help but overhear the slurring about the missing gambler being last seen
302480	308560	having a bit of a shouting match with Silas Cole after finding something unusual down
308560	313000	in the mine which he referred to as living oil.
313000	319640	And finally, Judge Ephraim Courtland, after finally spilling out into the world, recalled
319640	326320	a peculiar statement made by a recent inmate wherein the madman claimed Mary Cole to be
326320	328240	inhuman.
328240	333200	Judge Courtland then headed to the courthouse, which had been stripped of its copper wire
333200	338520	in the night, leaving the building without electricity to the judge's bewilderment.
338520	344880	Tartally, he loped to the church for the town hall meeting about the recent disappearances.
344880	350880	But staying right here forever is my ungodly ability to keep bringing the heat week after
350880	355600	week until you're weak from these sweet, sweet elite beats.
355600	360800	It's the Creek Rocks with Can't You Hear Them Wolves Howlin'
374880	382800	Can't you hear them wolves howlin' All around my poor little darlin'
382800	388800	All around my poor little darlin' I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'
396800	402800	Can't you hear them wolves howlin' All around my poor little darlin'
402800	407760	All around my poor little darlin' I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'
407760	412720	Can't you hear them wolves howlin' All around my poor little darlin'
412720	418720	All around my poor little darlin' I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'
426000	430400	Justin, what do you think you would do for money if you existed before 1900?
430400	432160	Oh, before 1900?
432160	434640	Yeah, like roughly in the 1880s somethings.
435200	436160	Shit.
437360	438560	Shovel up shit I guess.
443360	444720	Because I'd be worthless.
444720	445280	Aww.
445280	449520	I don't know, I'm a big dude. I guess I'd be like some kind of manual laborer or something.
449520	451440	Yeah, we would be in charge.
451440	454400	Oh yeah, I'm strong so I'd beat people into submission.
454400	456640	You could do like bare knuckle boxing.
456640	457680	Yeah, we'd box.
457680	461360	I would be the foreman and Luke would be the person I am mean to all the time.
461360	464480	I would be the boss because I can't do manual labor.
464480	466240	Is that how that works immediately?
466960	468560	No, I'd be a grifter for sure.
470960	475040	Just like flouting from town to town, changing your name.
475040	475840	Quick, what's your name?
476560	476880	John.
477760	479040	Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.
480640	482160	Wait wait wait, what is it now though?
482160	484800	That guy's like holy shit, that name is my name too.
487120	488240	Oh, nice to meet you Casey.
488240	490000	Luke Shelton here, nice to meet you.
490000	492640	Ooh, no, can I change my answer?
492640	494000	I can't, can I? It's too late.
494000	494480	Too late?
494480	496160	Never mind, go on, go on.
496160	496880	Terrible, man.
499760	501840	Joe, what would you do before 1900?
501840	502560	Would you be a barber?
502560	503840	Oh, could you be a barber?
503840	505680	No, I don't know how to cut hair.
505680	506320	I mean, I could.
506320	508320	I don't know how to be a foreman, but I'm going to.
508320	509760	It's the 1900s, dog.
509760	510480	There's no rules.
510480	511840	It's the 1800s.
511840	513280	The 1800s.
513280	514240	I could learn how to cut hair.
514240	518080	I was going to say, I mean, like a bartender or like a...
518080	520320	Well, the three of us would literally be giants.
520320	521680	Because we're tall?
521680	523360	They weren't, they were short back then?
523360	523600	Yeah.
523600	526160	They were, they were like four foot tall back then.
527120	527680	Hobbits.
527680	528480	I'm almost positive.
528480	529680	When was football invented?
529680	533520	Would we all just be on a football team and like decimate everyone in our pads?
533520	534960	Ooh, can I change my answer?
534960	537520	I want to play baseball in the late 1800s.
537520	538800	I'll teach them how to play if it's...
538800	539680	Oh, nice.
539680	540560	Was it 1870 something?
540560	542880	We're going to teach them how to play baseball.
543760	545360	And it's called Joe ball.
545360	547360	Yep, Joe ball.
547360	548320	After Joe mama.
549520	552000	Are you a first Joe's man or a second Joe's man?
552000	552880	Or do you play third?
553520	554080	Third.
554080	554560	Joe.
554560	555360	I'm a Joe stop.
555360	555680	Home Joe.
557760	558720	Home Joe's man.
560400	567040	If you, if like you were sent back now to like 1880, what could you actually invent?
567040	567760	And like...
567760	568720	Oh, like everything.
569920	571360	Oh, nothing.
571360	572240	Nothing for sure.
573040	574960	I was looking up recliners.
575520	580720	Recliners did not exist in the 1880s, so I think I could invent a recliner.
580720	582160	You could probably figure that out.
582160	585200	I would just do all sorts of music.
585200	590400	I would, for some reason, the first song on my mind is Higher by Creed.
590400	591520	I think they would love that.
592800	599680	You know what I think would legitimately probably go over pretty well is like any stomping music,
599680	601520	like Little Lion Man.
601520	602480	By Stomp?
602480	606000	No, like what, what's, who does Little Lion Man?
606000	607440	Trash can fellas?
607440	607940	No.
608800	610480	Oh, you're talking about Mumford and Sons?
610480	611040	Yeah.
611040	612240	Stomp, stomping music.
614240	616000	Stomping music?
616000	616240	Yeah.
616240	618480	They stomp their feet along with all the songs.
618480	620480	They didn't have a drummer, Thomas.
620480	623920	The lead singer just had a kick drum and that's it.
623920	624880	Is that a true story?
624880	626320	Is that part of their origin story?
626320	627680	Who did that song?
627680	630880	The Ho Hey song with stomping and clapping.
630880	632080	The Ho Hey?
632240	634480	What is that song or what is that band?
634480	638000	You know, like, Hey, they do that a lot throughout the song.
638000	640160	Isn't that Mumford and Sons?
640160	640960	I don't think it is.
642960	643920	The Lumineers.
645200	647520	I was a freshman in college in 2010.
647520	650160	I remember this time very well.
650160	653840	I had the Lumineers album on my iPod for sure.
653840	654560	Hell yeah, dude.
654560	655680	iPod touch?
655680	658800	No, iPod, the big one that held the most.
658800	659280	I don't know.
659280	660240	With the big roundy?
660240	661360	Though with the big roundy, yeah.
661360	663840	Could it play videos that were real tiny?
663840	664400	Like pornographies?
664400	665360	I didn't have any videos.
666240	670080	Did you put any dirty films on your big iPod?
671280	673360	I had explicit music on there.
673360	675680	When were you guys allowed to listen to explicit music?
676320	678800	I was never like not allowed to.
678800	679600	Did you have to hide it?
679600	680560	I just like wouldn't.
681360	684880	By the time that was a problem, I was just downloading everything I wanted.
685760	688240	I listened to a lot of classic rock until
688240	690880	LimeWire and then that's when I got all my stuff.
691600	697200	My parents bought me the Coolio album that had Gangster's Paradise on it on cassette tape.
698320	701760	We were listening to it and it's one of those rap albums that has a lot of skits
701760	703680	and they cuss up a storm in the skits.
703680	706640	I do remember my mom saying something like,
706640	709440	I wish we would have just gotten the soundtrack to Dead Man Walking,
709440	714400	which is where that song is from, instead of this whole Coolio album.
714400	716160	Holy shit, that's so good.
717040	720400	I had a three CD disc changer.
721120	726320	I specifically remember at one point in time, it had Mercy Me,
727120	730880	which was the Christian band who did I Can Only Imagine.
732160	738000	It had that album, it had Linkin Park reanimation remix,
738560	741840	and it had The Bends by Radiohead.
741840	743760	Ooh, good mix.
743760	744400	Interesting.
744400	746880	That's a mix, eclectic.
746880	748400	What year do you think that would have been?
749360	751920	2004?
751920	753040	2004?
753040	755200	Mine would have been just classic rock.
755200	756400	Oh, you're one of those people?
756960	757460	Yeah.
758720	761600	In 2004, for sure, mine would have been,
762160	765360	I think I was still, that would have been the tail end of my Zeppelin phase.
765360	771440	I would have been Led Zeppelin, AC DC, and just one that changes.
772080	774240	My dad's a big John Denver fan,
774240	777120	so I didn't get into classic rock until School of Rock came out.
778080	783360	I was in the only good music is weird, heady, underground rap
783360	785200	that I no longer listen to,
785200	788720	because it's not always the most fun thing to listen to.
788720	789920	Like Eminem?
789920	794320	No, like borderline fucking spoken word sometimes.
794320	795920	Like late Jay-Z.
797840	800000	Or like Tupac, are you going really underground?
802400	803760	Holy shit.
803760	804880	Oh, Joe.
806000	807440	I didn't mean it that way.
807440	808480	I didn't mean it that way.
808480	811280	I was trying to think of another big rapper.
812080	813360	He is alive.
813360	814560	I don't know if you know that.
814560	815840	Joe couldn't have meant it that way,
815840	821520	because he has sheltered Tupac for a few months in his loft.
821520	823280	He's like, I know Tupac's fucked.
824000	825840	That's why we're not allowed over there.
827600	829040	I try and bang the door down,
829040	831840	and Joe started hammering up barricades over.
832960	834160	Quick, Tupac, run!
840000	840720	What's he saying?
840720	842000	Does he have an E.T. in there?
844480	846080	Joe, you got E.T. in there?
846080	846800	Is that E.T.?
847440	848400	Joe's like, yeah!
849760	850640	It's definitely not.
850640	851280	It's an E.T.!
851920	852720	It's an E.T.!
852720	854800	It's not anything else.
855680	857040	It's not Mr. Shakur.
857040	857680	Oh my God.
857680	860960	It's Biggie!
860960	861920	Fine, it's Biggie!
863120	864000	It's 3Pac!
865920	867440	We're gonna have to cut all this, I'm sorry.
869440	870400	Just those last two.
874080	876560	Really ramped ourselves up for the Old West mood here.
879040	885920	So today is the day that is taking place currently.
885920	890800	So this will be the day after Everett's interesting evening,
890800	894160	after Horace Green's attempt at sleep,
894160	898960	and after Jack Perlman's night of fun.
899520	903840	So, Judge Ephraim, Courtland's day that we dove into.
905120	908320	Who's gonna be at the town hall meeting on time?
909040	909440	Not me.
910480	912880	Yeah, I don't think I would either.
912880	916400	I think Everett would be there on time with the night that he had.
916400	917360	Was it mandatory?
918000	919440	Oh right, the disappearances.
919440	921520	Yeah, Horace goes.
921520	923760	I'll be there but not on time, for sure.
923760	924320	Okay.
924320	924800	Rough night.
924800	928080	Sorry, I'm still thinking about how Joe harbored Tupac from,
930240	931840	you know, the Illuminati or whatever.
935040	935920	Or whatever.
935920	936640	Myriad.
936640	937120	There it is.
937840	941040	Luke and Justin, take your headphones off.
941040	942160	Okie dokie.
942160	943680	Oh my god, are you drinking a Coke?
943680	944640	Like a straight Coke?
945520	946640	Yeah, it's Coke Zero.
948000	949200	Nice, no calories.
949760	951200	Dr. Pepper 10.
951200	952560	It's only for men.
952560	954320	That was so fucking weird.
954320	958000	That was a terrible, terrible marketing campaign.
958000	959200	Thank god it backfired.
959760	960720	No joke.
960720	962480	Am I headphones off?
962480	963840	No, keep them on, please.
963840	966320	Okay, bye bye.
972800	981520	The dusty church's pews are full and the air is thick on this humid summer day.
981520	985600	Sweat is dripping down the skin of all in attendance.
985600	986960	And the smell in here?
986960	987280	Foul.
988080	992880	Thankfully, this is a lunch meeting, so the sun isn't shining directly through the windows,
992880	997520	but the shade just lends itself to the wetness of the air.
998400	1004400	Bobby Custard takes his place at the pulpit and begins speaking before the unruly crowd
1004400	1005120	simmers down.
1005920	1008720	Alrighty there folks, settle down, settle down.
1008720	1014400	As you all well know, we're here today to discuss the recent happenings regarding the
1014400	1016880	disappearances of all them saloon folk.
1017600	1022480	First off, does anyone have any information here to bring forward?
1022480	1028080	Everett from the back, he's still kind of tottering his way in and he hears the tail
1028080	1028560	end of that.
1030000	1033280	Yeah, I reckon I could shed some light on something that's going on.
1033920	1035200	I got some information.
1035200	1037280	Oh, Mr. Pace, yes, of course.
1038320	1041760	Round last night, I reckon the moon was high up there.
1041760	1044160	It must have been two in the morning or something.
1044160	1046960	There was a ruckus out there by the tree line.
1048480	1051840	There's something that means a lot to me out there.
1051840	1055840	It's where I buried my wife.
1055840	1057600	There's a gasp through the crowd.
1057600	1062560	Everyone's, there was somebody out there digging and it bothered me.
1062560	1066160	I walked up on and it was Miss Kitty.
1066160	1072160	And I was trying to tell her that they were looking for her.
1072160	1075440	And then she looked at me and then she just took off running in the woods.
1075440	1078400	I hollered after, but you know, I can't keep up with anybody these days.
1078400	1081200	And I don't know what happened after that.
1081200	1082080	Y'all have a good day.
1082080	1083200	And he starts walking out.
1083200	1084320	Oh, no, no, no.
1084320	1088400	Hey there, uh, Mr. Pace, please, please stay.
1088400	1091760	If you clearly have some sort of information.
1091760	1098720	And as Bobby is trying to trying to keep you in here, you see Thuro Sexton, who you know
1098720	1106880	as the night watch at the cemetery stands up, hat in hand.
1106880	1116320	Um, I, Everett, I thought I was crazy, but the fact that you said that makes me feel
1116320	1121920	okay saying this here now today here in front of everyone and go.
1124400	1132640	Last night, I scared off that Miss Kitty from digging up bodies in their own cemetery.
1133120	1139920	And when she ran off, I swear to God, I mean, sorry, preach.
1139920	1144080	I, I promise I Bible swear.
1144080	1144800	I swear.
1144800	1145360	I don't know.
1145360	1148000	I, I, I'm telling truth.
1149120	1156000	She had three corpses on her back and she ran off with them heading down south.
1156880	1158640	Miss Kitty's a grave robber.
1158640	1159760	Is that what you're trying to?
1160480	1170720	I don't know why she was going for so many bodies, but she clearly needed more than three
1170720	1175280	and must have headed down to your property there, sir.
1175280	1176960	I'm deeply sorry.
1177680	1178240	Thank goodness.
1178240	1180880	She didn't, she didn't get down in that hole deep enough.
1181520	1183920	I was able to put some earth wrap back on there.
1183920	1185680	She didn't get deep enough.
1185680	1187680	You must, you got her.
1188480	1190400	I would have never expected Miss Kitty.
1190400	1192400	Was she on hard times or something?
1192400	1194240	I think she's been gone.
1194240	1197920	She, she always had the money to live her life.
1200000	1206000	I often will go to the, and then he looks down and you see his wife looking back up
1206000	1212080	at him with huge eyes and he's like, I mean, I, she, I don't know.
1212640	1215520	Oh my goodness.
1215520	1220400	I did not expect this much information to come out so soon.
1220400	1224800	Like much appreciated from the both of you speaking up like this.
1233440	1235520	Jack, what horse are you riding on your way in?
1235520	1237520	Same old, same old Jeremiah.
1238160	1247200	So these two fucking gorgeous steeds are taking these two men of very opposing distinctive
1247200	1252480	features toward the church house at the exact same time.
1252480	1259360	And Jack Pearlman and Judge Ephraim Courtland arrive almost simultaneously.
1259360	1262960	I kind of look over Ephraim and kind of nod to him.
1264240	1265440	God damn it.
1265440	1269840	Ephraim gets off his horse and just looks at him and starts walking towards the meeting.
1269840	1272640	I like tie up my, do you tie up a horse?
1272640	1273360	We'll say yeah.
1273360	1274480	You tie, tie up my horse.
1274480	1276000	You got to tie up that horse.
1276000	1280400	Otherwise any old random groundhogs can come up and they're scaring off around there and
1280400	1282560	take off without a horse driving around.
1282560	1285040	Exactly the words I would have also used.
1285040	1285540	Same.
1286640	1291760	I give Jeremiah a good little pet and head on in following the nasty man.
1291760	1295440	Spits on the ground.
1304160	1310720	The doors bust wide open to the church and you see the towering six foot ten, 300 pound
1310720	1314080	of disgusting flesh falling from itself.
1314160	1323600	Presence of Judge Ephraim Courtland spit on the ground as he walks in to the church with
1323600	1330480	Jack Pearlman, a much different hotter figure, following right behind.
1330480	1331600	This man's sexy.
1336320	1342320	All the men and women in the audience, the congregation, the town congregation, we're
1342320	1344640	in a church, it's not a service, whatever.
1344640	1352640	They all become green with the sight of Judge Courtland and then immediately blood rushes
1352640	1359440	to certain spots and especially cheeks when Jack Pearlman walks into the church.
1359440	1365120	Okay, so you're saying, you're saying that we got Miss Kitty just living around here.
1365120	1366800	Oh, hello there Judge.
1367280	1373600	Um, I was just asking to see if there's anyone who had any sort of information to bring forward
1373600	1376320	about the disappearances recently of the saloon.
1376320	1378080	My copper wire got stolen.
1379040	1380480	Can't turn the lights on.
1381120	1382480	That's why I'm here.
1382480	1387440	And the judge is just standing in the aisle and everyone's just kind of looking at him.
1387440	1388720	Uh, okay.
1389600	1396080	Is that, I'm sure, do you want me as like Sheriff, you want me to take care of that?
1396880	1397280	Get it.
1397280	1398800	I can't turn my lights on.
1400160	1400480	Okay.
1400480	1403680	That'll be the first thing that we take care of after this.
1403680	1407200	Yeah, no, what the hell else are you talking about here?
1407200	1412000	That my secretary told me to come here because of my wires.
1412640	1414480	Thought that was what this meeting was about.
1414480	1416800	About the disappearances currently.
1416800	1418560	Well, and he sits down.
1419120	1420080	There's like the pew.
1420080	1424320	He just like scoots someone over and sits like right next to the aisle.
1425040	1426080	Rhubarb, rhubarb.
1426080	1431360	Jack Pearlman, I'm assuming was kind of like with him upon entering, but whenever he started
1432000	1437600	mouthing off and yelling, he kind of just like scooted sideways kind of a way to the,
1437600	1442800	the back of the, the church to kind of listen and not be associated with him at all.
1442800	1443760	Yeah, makes sense.
1444320	1448880	Professor Horace Green, any, uh, just like what's running through your head?
1448880	1450560	Horace Green is just reading a book.
1450560	1453280	And that, uh, yes, no, we'll definitely take care of that.
1453280	1453600	Sure.
1453600	1459040	As, as soon as we're done here, first thing that I look into for sure, but we're talking
1459040	1465920	about these disappearances and that is what we need to discuss now that we've got, uh,
1465920	1467840	Satan's last night of Ms.
1467840	1469280	Kitty out and about.
1470160	1471040	Grave Robin.
1471600	1473840	Kitty was grave Robin.
1474560	1476160	I seen her with my own two eyes.
1477040	1477920	Uh, yes.
1477920	1484640	And, and, and I too says thorough Sexton who's the nightwatch, the cemetery.
1484640	1486800	What'd you ever, what'd you dig up?
1486800	1488000	What'd you see her dig up?
1488000	1490720	It was three old, old bodies.
1490720	1493280	I run her off before she could get anything of mine.
1493280	1493840	Who was it?
1494400	1495360	Who'd you dig up?
1495360	1495840	Yeah.
1495840	1498560	Who, who'd you get from the cemetery over there?
1498560	1506400	It was, uh, Sally Jensen who, as we all know, pass God 30 years ago now.
1506960	1512000	Mitzi Frankenship, who unfortunately left us 34 years ago.
1512960	1521920	And Rebecca Feinsteem, Feinsteem, Rebecca Feinsteem, Steem.
1523200	1524400	I can't pronounce it.
1524400	1527520	It's a lot of consonants all in a row.
1528160	1538960	It's S T E I N F P F I E M P Z F.
1538960	1545600	I don't know how to say that, but she died 37 years ago.
1545600	1547840	She, she taught me in school.
1548560	1550560	I remember I had to spell her name.
1554080	1555600	It had every letter of the alphabet.
1557520	1561760	I'm sorry for your loss.
1561760	1568240	I tried to get to her, but, um, I'm a heavy sleeper.
1570480	1574880	So some of his kitty disappeared him or what?
1574880	1576640	Uh, yes, just seemingly.
1576640	1582240	So Ms. Kitty did come around and, uh, and it was taken by, she took three before she
1582240	1587200	headed off three from the cemetery for she headed off up to the pace place.
1587200	1589680	She must've dropped off them bodies somewhere along the way.
1589680	1590480	Cause she didn't have them.
1590480	1593440	When she came up to my place, what was she doing there?
1593440	1595920	She's trying to dig up Claire's grave.
1597840	1598160	Okay.
1598160	1598880	Let's go get her.
1599520	1600080	Go get her.
1600080	1600560	What?
1600560	1601920	You know where she is?
1601920	1603280	I figured you might.
1603280	1604400	What are we even here for?
1604400	1608640	If you don't know where she is, pardon, pardon, pardon me, judge.
1608640	1610320	But what do you mean by let's?
1611040	1616800	I mean, us, it doesn't really look like you're in much shape to get
1616800	1620160	anybody much less join a horse riding posse.
1620160	1623360	Ephraim stands up and points his gun at, at Horace.
1623360	1627360	Oh my God.
1627360	1630160	Speaking, I'm speaking as a biologist, sir.
1630160	1632000	You've seen me ride my horse.
1632000	1633280	You know, I can ride around.
1635600	1637600	I don't believe I have seen that, sir.
1637600	1638400	My mistake.
1638400	1639440	Shut the fuck up.
1640640	1641440	Let's go get her.
1646800	1651600	Shut the fuck up.
1651600	1653840	When judge says, shut the fuck up.
1653840	1659200	You see that, um, Bobby custard just puts both of his hands in the air.
1659200	1660000	Well, you guilty.
1662400	1663680	Oh, holy shit.
1668960	1670640	Oh my God.
1670640	1672480	It's going to kill everyone.
1672720	1677760	He's got mad monster.
1677760	1682960	It's just, it's the baddie.
1690240	1691040	Fuck.
1691040	1696880	And I holster my gun, get my flask out, take a drink of it, put it back and just sit down.
1696880	1698080	And the whole crowd goes.
1698080	1703360	And Jack Pearlman lets off of his pistol grip.
1703360	1708800	Like he had professor green starts nervously smoking a pipe.
1710160	1710640	Totally.
1710640	1710960	Okay.
1711840	1712400	Completely.
1712400	1712720	Okay.
1712720	1713760	No one bats an eye.
1713760	1715360	Everyone's down for it.
1715360	1716400	They enjoy the smell.
1716400	1720400	This is healthy for the nerves and invigorating for the lungs.
1720400	1724640	Everett this whole time has seemed unaffected by the whole situation is more confused than
1724640	1725520	anything else.
1725520	1727680	So are we, you know, where she is or we're going to get her.
1727920	1728640	What's going on?
1728640	1730320	Does anyone know?
1730320	1731760	Thorough is standing up again.
1732320	1735520	Does anyone know where she is?
1736080	1736560	Everett?
1736560	1738320	Where did you last see her?
1738320	1742080	She is running off in the tree line of the past behind my house.
1742080	1743200	I mean, south.
1743760	1744480	How long ago?
1746320	1747360	It was, it was last night.
1747360	1749200	I think it was about two in the morning.
1749200	1750240	I just made that up, Zach.
1750240	1752080	I don't know if that matters the time.
1752960	1755040	No, it was three in the morning.
1755040	1755840	It was late at night.
1755840	1756960	I didn't have my watch on me.
1757680	1763280	Perhaps the judge would like to lead us in searching for her trail out by a tree line.
1764000	1766880	Everybody roll spot hidden.
1769600	1771280	62 on a 65.
1773280	1774800	41 on a 45.
1775600	1777440	76 on a 40 fail.
1777440	1779760	I fail at 97 on a 45.
1779760	1781760	I'm a dinosaur hunter.
1781760	1784480	All I do is spot hidden bones.
1785760	1787440	That's my character.
1787440	1789600	Joe and Justin, take your headphones off.
1798240	1803040	Professor Horace Green and Judge Ephraim Cortland.
1803600	1811680	Around this time, you notice a man standing in one of the windows watching the proceedings
1811680	1812320	take place.
1813040	1816480	You recognize him immediately as Silas Cole.
1816480	1821120	This man has made contention what it is today.
1821120	1824720	He is the reason that the mine is profitable.
1824720	1829280	He is the reason that there's electricity all throughout the entire town.
1829280	1835600	He is the philanthropist making sure that children have education.
1835600	1836720	Him and his wife, Mary.
1837520	1838880	He's five foot eight.
1838880	1840960	He's got messy, dirty blonde hair.
1841520	1848000	His crooked yellow teeth and bright green eyes that are sunken in, but they're also
1848000	1850240	bulging a little bit.
1850240	1856080	And he's just paying very close attention to everything happening from a back window
1856080	1857120	of the church.
1857120	1859120	Uh, I run outside to go talk to him.
1860240	1864720	I'm gonna come after him, follow, see what the professor's up to.
1864720	1870400	Do I have time to talk briefly in private before the judge can ooze his way forward?
1870400	1871760	Yeah, let's do a little contest.
1873280	1879120	I believe there are some breakdowns in athletics in this game.
1879120	1879840	And so...
1882400	1882960	Oh, nope.
1882960	1883840	There are not.
1883840	1885440	I was completely wrong.
1885440	1887680	How would you run fast in this game?
1887680	1889680	Fast talk, but with your legs.
1889680	1891600	Pilot your own self.
1891600	1891920	Jump.
1895520	1897680	It's like a video game where if you jump, fast.
1897680	1899200	All right, we'll just use dexterity.
1899200	1901520	So roll a dexterity contest against each other.
1903360	1903760	Fail.
1903760	1905200	49 on a 40.
1905200	1905600	Fail.
1905600	1906800	73 on a 60.
1906800	1908880	Okay, so you're both going to make it out at the same time?
1908880	1910480	Stumbling over each other.
1910480	1911360	Yeah.
1911360	1919040	With Courtland leaving, there's a breath of fresh air inside as you both kind of bail
1919040	1919680	outside.
1921520	1927680	Yes, now the smell of Judge Courtland has dissipated from his region.
1928560	1933120	And you make it out there and you see that Silas Cole is this man.
1933120	1934880	Just these massive eyes.
1934880	1936800	He's holding a ladder.
1936800	1944160	And right next to him, he has odd looking mechanical devices with some sort of like
1944160	1949120	wooden planks going off from a middle point on his body.
1949120	1949600	No, no, no.
1949600	1955760	On the ground next to him, he's got like three or four of these devices, essentially,
1955760	1961680	that have some sort of motor in the middle and then these planks coming off from them
1961680	1964240	and around his shoulder like a lasso.
1964240	1966000	He's got copper wiring.
1967680	1971280	Oh, well, Ephraim, we might have solved your problem.
1971280	1973200	He's wearing huge pants.
1974320	1979600	So he's wearing both suspenders and a belt.
1979600	1982400	Well, a chill runs down Thomas's spine.
1982400	1987040	As any beans getting in the mix can only mean trouble.
1987040	1987520	No, no, no.
1987520	1989040	This is Silas Cole.
1989040	1990240	I know, but clearly.
1994000	2004240	Mr. Cole, as you may know, I'm Professor Horace Green, and I sometimes pay your men to bring
2004240	2007440	me any fossils they might find in the mine.
2008240	2009440	I'm concerned about...
2010560	2011360	Why are you concerned?
2013120	2018400	One of your employees, Thomas, a young man who would bring me fossils.
2020000	2025920	I haven't been able to find him today, and he told me he had found something quite special.
2028800	2030080	Have you heard anything about Thomas?
2030080	2031680	Did anything happen to him in the mine?
2033360	2036800	No, he's completely avoiding eye contact with you.
2036800	2040480	His eyes are bugged out, looking at the ground, kind of looking at your feet.
2040480	2042480	And then he looks straight up at you, and he's like,
2043280	2044400	No, I don't...
2045280	2046160	Looks back down.
2046160	2048160	I don't know what you're talking about.
2048160	2050160	Did you create these devices?
2051040	2051540	Yeah.
2051920	2054160	I'm something of a man of science myself.
2054160	2056640	Could you explain the principle to me?
2056640	2057280	It spins.
2058000	2061840	I'll show you if we go inside, but did you...
2063360	2065760	This Thomas fellow, what do you know about him?
2066640	2068080	Well, I know he was a gambler.
2068240	2073840	Uh, I'm worried someone might have hurt him for his gambling debts.
2073840	2074960	Do you think that's why he's gone?
2076160	2077360	It could be, Mr. Cole.
2077360	2078960	Why do you think he's gone?
2078960	2081600	Probably the same reason that you said just now.
2081600	2082100	Indeed.
2083040	2087760	In all candor, Mr. Cole, I had heard you were quarreling with Thomas
2087760	2089680	the day before his disappearance.
2089680	2090640	Interesting.
2090640	2092320	What was that quarrel about?
2092320	2094480	He was down, uh, he didn't do his job.
2094800	2101600	And you see Ephraim's like just finished packing some chew into his lip,
2101600	2103520	and he lights a hand-rolled cigarette.
2104080	2110640	He walks over to Silas and just grabs the copper wire off his shoulder.
2110640	2115760	Okay, so first off, I need psychology.
2115760	2117200	Yeah, go ahead and roll psychology.
2118240	2119600	Should have a points into that.
2119600	2121360	A 90 on a 10.
2121360	2122800	I got a lot of weird skills though.
2123440	2124640	43 out of 10.
2124640	2128720	Um, yeah, he wasn't, he wasn't doing his job right.
2128720	2131280	We had words, I'm glad he's working for you,
2131280	2135520	because he's not working for me now, obviously, because he's gone.
2135520	2139840	And then Judge Ephraim grabs the copper wiring or goes to,
2139840	2145280	and Silas Cole puts his opposite arm on the Judge's shoulder
2145280	2147440	and looks straight up into his eyes.
2148000	2152000	And you see these wild green bulging eyes looking at you.
2152800	2158800	Are you sure that you want to do that unless you're helping me?
2158800	2162080	Because it seemed like maybe you're not helping.
2162080	2168240	Your lights, your lights stopped working because it looks like you took my copper wire.
2168240	2169680	I would do no such thing.
2170240	2173360	If your lights aren't working there in the courthouse,
2173360	2176080	then I can get that working for you.
2176640	2179040	But these are for the church currently.
2179600	2183600	So please either help me carry them inside or release them.
2183600	2185360	Okay, when can you get them to mine?
2186080	2187840	I need it like now.
2188480	2191280	I can't do any work in the dark.
2191280	2192800	You're not there now.
2193600	2197120	And so let's go inside the church first.
2197120	2199920	Uh, Ephraim blows some smoke into his face,
2199920	2203520	grabs the copper wire and heads back into the church.
2203520	2206800	Horace Green, um, chews on his pipe a little bit
2206800	2209840	and blows some smoke into the air and turns around and goes back into the church.
2210400	2214000	And Silas Cole doesn't make a fucking move
2214000	2217520	the entire time either one of those actions are taken.
2218400	2219600	Let's bring the boys back.
2227920	2230880	Courtland and Green, do you want to describe in order
2231440	2233600	how you arrived back into the church?
2233680	2236960	Ephraim walks into the church, smoking a cigarette,
2238480	2244480	spits some chew spit on the ground and he's got copper wire over his shoulder
2244480	2249600	and he just throws a copper wire onto the ground and just kind of stands there.
2249600	2254560	Horace goes back to where he was sitting and opens up his book again,
2254560	2257280	but it doesn't really look like he's reading it now.
2257280	2258320	Cole's here.
2258320	2263200	And as soon as Courtland, Judge Courtland says Cole's here,
2263760	2270160	the doors bust open to the church and a skittish man looking at the ground in front of him
2270160	2275280	kind of seeing the copper wiring on the ground immediately starts collecting it
2275280	2280320	as he's pulling in these four odd contraptions you've never seen before.
2280320	2284720	Some sort of motor in the middle and then wooden planks coming off from the sides.
2284800	2289760	Silas Cole is five foot eight with messy dirty blonde hair.
2289760	2295760	He's got crooked yellow teeth and these bright green eyes that are sunken in
2295760	2298240	but also bulging at the same time.
2298800	2302080	And he's wearing huge pants.
2302080	2305360	He's got suspenders and a belt.
2306880	2308080	Holy shit.
2310240	2310720	Yeah, no.
2311120	2311620	Yeah.
2313120	2314720	Sorry, preacher there.
2315840	2316320	You're good.
2316320	2316880	Carry on.
2316880	2319920	I'm just gonna go ahead and hook these up for y'all.
2319920	2322400	It's pretty hot in here.
2322400	2326400	And this is the new one and kind of like holds a thumbs up.
2327280	2328240	Do we do this yet?
2329520	2330320	You guys get this?
2332720	2333920	Oh God, Zach.
2333920	2335440	You really do need to watch Dark.
2337760	2338640	I can't wait.
2339520	2340480	You found your wire.
2341040	2342080	No, he's got...
2342800	2347440	He said he didn't steal mine, but he's gonna help fix it, I hope.
2347440	2350640	Silas, do you know where Kitty is, Miss Kitty?
2350640	2355360	Silas Cole has already set up a ladder in the middle of the aisle and is all the way up
2355360	2364080	and is hooking up the very first ceiling fan that's ever existed here in the town of Contingent.
2364080	2365840	And he looks down at you and he's like,
2366480	2370400	I don't know who you're talking about.
2370400	2372880	We're all here because of some missing people.
2373440	2375360	Why didn't you come to the meeting?
2376000	2377760	Maybe you know something about it.
2377760	2380880	And Ephraim walks over to the ladder
2381440	2385840	and puts a hand on it and kind of like menacingly looks up at Silas.
2385840	2388400	I don't know anything about any missing people.
2388400	2397600	I'm just here to provide circulating air for the entire townsfolk here while I have contention.
2397600	2398960	Air's not good enough here.
2401680	2406480	Being right above you, the smell is not pleasant.
2407120	2410720	You hear a little harumph from Horace Green.
2410720	2415840	Ephraim just keeps staring up at him and he finishes putting in the first ceiling fan,
2416560	2418720	comes back down the ladder.
2418720	2420400	Are you like right at the base?
2420400	2425040	Like not to where he can't get down but where I'll be like right next to him when he gets down.
2425040	2430880	And then yeah he just looks you dead in the eyes with these wild crazed green eyes
2430880	2433840	and begins moving the ladder forward.
2433840	2440000	He runs the wire through real quick and sets it up and the first fan starts going.
2440080	2447680	And everyone in this room feels relief from this hot humid air for the first time.
2447680	2450800	And as he begins setting up the second one he looks down.
2452160	2456480	I don't think that the dearest appearances need to be looked into.
2457200	2459200	Personally, good riddance.
2459200	2462160	Contention's better off without those people.
2462160	2463600	That's not for you to decide.
2463600	2465840	That's literally my job.
2465840	2470400	Well, it kind of seems like we're here at a town hall meeting
2470400	2474160	to figure out what the next best move is.
2475200	2479200	Bobby Custard takes control once again and is like,
2479200	2482000	well yeah no that is about there they're right.
2482000	2488000	And you know with all this air flowing down I feel like it's about time to take a vote.
2488000	2490480	Oh shit that does feel pretty nice.
2490480	2493680	Hey when you fix up my lights you need to put one of these in.
2493760	2495920	Silas Cole looks at you.
2496640	2499040	I can make that happen.
2499040	2500480	We get to it then.
2500480	2504240	So nobody's looking into these disappearances?
2504240	2506880	I didn't even know about them until I showed up here.
2506880	2509600	I'm more concerned with that so.
2509600	2513360	Mr. Cole why don't you want us to look into these disappearances?
2513360	2514560	Completely ignores you.
2514560	2519440	And the crowd begins to continue to chatter and chatter and chatter
2519440	2526240	until their voices rise up meeting yours and your voice is lost as you say Mr. Cole.
2526240	2529040	Jack walks up to Bobby Custard.
2529680	2531200	Is it Custer or Custer?
2531200	2532880	Yep Bobby Custard.
2532880	2537040	And he walks up to him he's like you better get control of this crowd now
2537040	2540240	if you want anything to be done hand on shoulder.
2540240	2547840	I mean I think looking up at Silas Cole who's putting up the final ceiling fan in the church.
2548400	2551520	I I think we're good probably.
2552080	2555440	You're gonna tell me one of us goes missing.
2556160	2559680	A couple ceiling fans will do the trick you don't want to look for us.
2559680	2564720	As I say that I'm gripping him ever so slightly more aggressively.
2564720	2565520	Roll intimidate.
2568320	2569840	Uh do not pass.
2569840	2575760	Bobby just kind of like shirks off of you as Everett Pace approaches.
2575760	2579600	Bobby I I don't know much about what's going on here but if there's a grave
2579600	2582160	robber on the loose we're gonna have to stop that.
2582160	2585200	They'll just keep coming night after night taking all the bodies.
2585200	2586880	Horace is pushing his way up too.
2587840	2594480	Sheriff I overheard a minor last night um saying that one of the disappeared had been
2594480	2595680	arguing with Mr. Cole.
2595680	2599280	Now I seem to think he's he's got an ulterior mold of fear.
2599280	2602880	Don't just let these people disappear because he gave you some fans.
2603440	2606480	Ephraim's looking up at the fans and then looks down and sees
2606480	2610080	these three talking to Bobby and waddles over there.
2610080	2615760	Now I I it's not that I'm not doing anything because there's fans here it's just that
2615760	2621360	I'm not doing anything because people don't seem too upset except for maybe the three
2621360	2628400	of you and if if we don't know where this person who clearly disappeared and then somehow
2628400	2629440	came back.
2629440	2634000	If we don't know where to go after her then I don't know what you expect me to do.
2634000	2636640	Well it sounds to me like she's got something in the woods there.
2636640	2637840	She had three bodies.
2637840	2639600	She didn't have three bodies when I saw her.
2639600	2641760	She dropped them off somewhere between here and there.
2641760	2643680	We got to search around between here and there.
2643680	2647520	And that's what Judge Courtland hears as he approaches.
2647520	2650560	I forgot about this damn body sir.
2651360	2654240	Sheriff what are you planning on doing about about that?
2654240	2656960	Because you know you got to do your job so I can do mine.
2658560	2661760	He looks over all of your shoulders at Silas Cole.
2662880	2666320	Thanks Mr. Cole we certainly do appreciate it here.
2666320	2670800	I I slap him like with my walking stick in the shin when he does that.
2670800	2680880	Now I now I certainly don't want to step on any toes here of the man who essentially
2680880	2685200	owns and runs this town if you guys catch my drift.
2685920	2693040	But if you happen to have plans aka Mr. Pace going down to the woods trying to find a spot
2693040	2699920	in between the two spots I'll certainly come with you if if you if you if you require my
2699920	2706720	assistance but if we could keep it on the down low from Mr. Cole clearly I think that
2706720	2708960	would be the best course of action.
2708960	2713200	So maybe don't all stand around here all at the same time.
2713200	2714320	I get it yeah.
2714320	2718400	Jack turns around and just starts walking out puts his hat back on his head or whatever.
2718400	2723520	Not all at once but let's pretend like we're dissatisfied and after Jack's gone away like
2723520	2727600	a little bit then the professor turns around too and he's like he looks like he did not
2727600	2729440	get what he wanted from the from the sheriff.
2729440	2735920	No I I promise I'm doing my job y'all just need to you know calm down about the whole
2735920	2737280	situation.
2738720	2743040	Uh Ephraim looks at Everett and looks at Bobby he's like I don't see any reason to piss
2743040	2746320	him off till I get one of them fans so uh yeah.
2747440	2754400	And then I make a big show of spitting on Bobby's shoes and slowly turn around and
2754400	2755120	walk off.
2755120	2757520	Bobby looks directly at Everett Pace.
2757520	2761040	He didn't have to he didn't have to spit on my shoes like that.
2761040	2770720	Everett grabs the preacher by the shoulder and pulls him in real tight close to his ear.
2771760	2776640	We're gonna find that grave robber and if something happens to Clara's grave before
2776640	2780320	we do it's you that I'm blaming.
2780320	2781520	And he starts walking away.
2782160	2782560	Nice.
2783200	2783600	Sick.
2784320	2784880	Fuck yeah.
2784880	2785920	What a creepo.
2787600	2789280	Oh I love Everett Pace.
2789280	2791200	What a horrifying creature.
2791200	2793920	You guys all made dope characters.
2793920	2794560	Big fan.
2795360	2797680	Horrified of what you're capable of.
2802320	2806800	As characters you're curious as to the the uh the thoughts.
2807360	2809520	I think Everett is kind of on the surface right now.
2809520	2814400	He's he's worried about his the grave on his property there and uh you know doesn't
2814400	2815520	really know what's going on.
2815520	2819200	He kind of removes himself from the town's affairs normally so
2819200	2821440	it's just that this ended up on his doorstep.
2821440	2826240	Horace typically wouldn't care to get involved either but he can't resist a conundrum.
2826240	2830080	Courtland didn't expect to get wrapped into any of this he just wanted his
2830080	2834880	lights on and but he he really does love stringing up a
2834880	2838400	a criminal so he gets excited at the thought of catching one.
2838400	2842560	Horrifying.
2842560	2847600	Jack Pearlman probably was uh less invested before he got pissed off by
2847600	2850960	Judge and Silas Cole kind of just being assholes.
2851600	2857040	Which is funny because at first he was pissed off at the Judge for being an a jerk to Silas
2857040	2861920	Cole and that he was way more pissed off at Silas Cole implying that they should do nothing.
2862560	2866560	And it kind of lit a little fire underneath him as a citizen of contention.
2866560	2867600	Under his little butt.
2867600	2869920	Under his little hot buns.
2869920	2871760	Under his tight little butt.
2873520	2878640	So yeah he I think he would he's definitely he's a little on fire right now like he's like angry
2878640	2883440	but it's trying to direct trying to direct it in a way to do something instead of just
2883440	2884400	punching somebody.
2884400	2891920	Maybe a change of pace for old Jack Pearlman.
2891920	2894080	I love Everett Pace with all my heart.
2894880	2900080	And uh I think Jack Pearlman and Everett Pace are gonna get fanfic'd together.
2900080	2901360	I can predict it already.
2902720	2903280	Ship him.
2903280	2904000	Ship him.
2904000	2907440	Yeah we're both you know we both are living alone on our.
2909440	2911200	Your couple's name could be Jace.
2912000	2912500	Oh.
2913680	2914180	Jevret.
2915920	2917040	Or Earlman.
2920400	2920900	Pervert?
2921680	2922240	There it is.
2924240	2924880	Pervert.
2927120	2927760	Nailed it.
2927760	2928320	Nice.
2928320	2936320	As the crowd dissipates from the church and heads to their respective daily goings-ons
2937040	2944240	you see Silas Cole walking down south to the new mine where they've set up shop after the one
2944240	2948160	a little bit west of there has finished up.
2948160	2950480	Started a new dig site further south.
2950480	2959600	And the four of you kind of reconvene with the sheriff, the preacher, Bobby Custard,
2959600	2962480	and Professor Horace Green steps right up.
2962480	2966560	So father sheriff when when do we go looking for for Miss Kitty?
2966560	2969520	I mean are y'all free now?
2970160	2970480	Yes.
2971040	2976000	Since we have the daylight it seems like if she's out there robbing graves it seems like
2976000	2982640	a scary time to maybe look for her now but you know by nightfall maybe we'll have a better
2982640	2987600	sense of where she's heading and then we'll be able to catch her in the act if you will.
2987600	2994080	Perhaps hopefully we see I feel like the daylight is the less scary time to look for the grave
2994080	2998720	robber and we would like to find her before she commits the act again you know ideally.
2998720	2999840	Is that not what I said?
3001360	3002720	I don't think so.
3002720	3006320	Okay you were very smart and I agree.
3006320	3006800	Let's go.
3008000	3012800	So if we if we were we gonna go look in the woods for her or?
3012800	3014880	Well I tell you my place is right there.
3014880	3017840	The cemetery is right there so let's go right there.
3017840	3021520	And I point I just like drew a line between the two and pointed to the middle.
3023760	3029600	Well if we're gonna look for her now I'm I'm okay with that has been a while since I
3030320	3034080	uh left anything on Ruth and Cassie's graves so.
3035040	3037360	He's gonna softball it in there like that?
3037360	3039520	It's my wife and daughter.
3039520	3041600	Fresh graves you say?
3044560	3051120	I ain't got no tracking skills but I'll help maybe maybe not who can say.
3051120	3054560	Oh oh tracking skills that's what we need anybody got any of those?
3055360	3058080	I know but I can spot hidden things and I can
3059040	3062400	navigate and I have a great understanding of the natural world.
3062400	3065360	Ah the natural world that's something I know about too.
3065360	3066160	Yeah me too.
3067840	3074480	You know perhaps we need to dig or excavate uh to solve this grave robbing mystery I.
3074480	3077200	Sheriff now you must uh surely be.
3077200	3081680	I'm finding myself less and less knowledgeable about the natural world
3081760	3084640	and more and more knowledgeable about tracking.
3084640	3086160	That's what I was hoping you'd say.
3088960	3092000	You you're uh you hunt quite a bit don't you Sheriff?
3092000	3096480	You seem like you might join us on Midian Adventure here in the future.
3096480	3100960	Of course it's his job to guide lost souls through the wilderness.
3101520	3104000	Yeah we just decided that you're an expert tracker.
3104960	3109120	And that nice raccoon that raccoon hat you're wearing you
3109120	3111360	must have got that from tracking and trapping it.
3111760	3118320	And he just pets it and then he makes a purring sound for it.
3120400	3121840	I hate that I stopped doing that.
3126880	3128880	I'll probably find an ending in there somewhere.
3130160	3138000	Hey by the way Sheriff you got any new people I need to on the docket I should look at?
3138000	3140880	I didn't have time because the the lights were off.
3142080	3144160	No no the episode's over now okay.
3146160	3146800	Stop it.
3149120	3150000	Stop rolling with it.
3150000	3150640	I'm off the clock.
3152000	3153280	I said I met that acting.
3154080	3155280	We normally don't do outros.
3155840	3163440	That that that this was episode 91 of pretending to be people.
3163440	3166000	Oh yes yes y'all come back now you hear?
