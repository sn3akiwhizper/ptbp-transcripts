0	16400	Thanks. Thanks for that fridge. It was like the grudge sound. Sounds like clinking bones.
16400	19640	My fridge used to make that noise and I thought it was mice for the longest time. It's just
19640	22760	the ice machine, right? It's the ice maker, right? I don't have an ice maker. It was something
22760	28380	that went back in the fridge. There was a mouse in the fridge? No man, it was the ghost
28380	35340	of his old fridge. I used to think it was mice and it was. What's up everybody? I'm
35340	40740	Zach. Welcome to season two of Pretending to be People. First off, Joe, do you need
40740	44700	to listen to season one of Pretending to be People? Hell no. But should you listen to
44700	48680	season one of Pretending to be People, Luke? Hell yeah. And what did you think about season
48680	51740	one of Pretending to be People, Thomas? I thought we could do better. That's why we're
51740	59220	here. The whole gang is back together for another quick and simple role playing campaign.
59220	63900	In and out, 20 minute campaign. Justin is also back with us as both Wolf the dog, the
63900	69640	AM radio DJ, who will continue to introduce each episode. And he's also returning as our
69640	75260	in-house composer. Justin actually messaged me and said, hey Zach. That's how he messages
75260	81980	me, or at least the time. Oh, he's got to relate. Parentheses, sultry, sexy. Hey Zach,
81980	91100	I created all new music for season two. What the fuck? We're so fucking excited to have
91100	96420	Justin back in-house composing for season two. Very excited. I hope it's good. Oh, I
96420	103700	listened to it. We'll see. Now we are here because what do we do? We play a role playing
103700	111180	game. We play a tabletop role playing game. That stands for TTRPG. That's right. And
111180	115820	what are TTRPGs, Thomas? Well, that's where you get your best friends around a table or
115820	121140	whatever you have, but we have a table. I thought you meant like best friends or whoever
121140	125300	you have around. Right. Which is also true. We lucked into our role playing group, but
125300	130300	I understand that that is a very common phenomenon. Yes. Fortunately, we are best friends who
130300	134860	role play together. So we get around our table, our tabletop, and we roll some dice
134860	138980	and pretend to be people. And we tell stories together. He said the name. He said the name.
138980	143380	He did it. I got that in there. Hell yeah. So last season we played an amalgamation of
143380	148060	a game called Delta Green, the role playing game and a game called Pulp Cthulhu. This
148060	152480	season we are maybe going to utilize a lot of those same rules, but we're really focusing
152480	157860	in on just using a stripped down version of the original Delta Green rules. Which is a
157860	163020	what offshoot of Call of Cthulhu. It is an offshoot of the game by Chaosium, Call of
163020	167820	Cthulhu. I should mention here Delta Green is published by Arc Dream Publishing. Shout
167820	173220	out to them for creating an absolutely phenomenal game that we can't remember all the rules
173220	182460	to. So we play our own version of it. That's what we mean by stripped down. Complete. Whose
182460	190980	green is it anyway? We should also mention that we play what's called a closed game.
190980	195220	What does that mean? Oh, that just means that when your characters choose to go off on their
195220	203300	own or split the party, then we actually split up our in real life party here and have the
203300	208180	people whose characters are not in the room go into a different physical room. Dude, I
208180	212580	must have not been paying attention like the last season because I legit thought that you
212580	218300	would just like get mad at us and like randomly be like, get the fuck out of this. And I was
218300	222740	like, it's confusing. And then, but you know, sometimes it's like a long time out. Sometimes
222740	227020	it's just like 30 seconds. So, but that makes so much more sense. Luke was getting confused
227020	232700	because we do send them on time outs. Those are different than the closed game. Yeah.
232700	236820	Time out. If any of us were there with you, that was a moment of a closed game. But if
236860	243700	you were just in the corner with your hat, that was a time out. I hate that fucking hat.
243700	249740	Zach, it really defeats the purpose of the discipline if he doesn't even know he's being
249740	253940	punished. That's a good point. You just said fuck. I've already said fuck. Let's talk about
253940	259780	the explicit content warning. Yeah. There's a real big fucking content warning on this show.
259780	266300	And we delve into some pretty dark subjects. Yeah. It's not just cursing. We use the cursing
266300	271020	to describe terrible things. Terrible things is what the explicit tag is for. It is certainly
271020	275380	not just for fuck words. Uh, we're going to get pretty gross. We're going to get pretty
275380	281140	weird. Yeah. Slimy, gory, violent, scary. It's going to get fucked up. Some real twisted
281140	290460	stuff. Although it's fun when we do it. Yeah. If you're scared of, yeah. Trigger warning.
290460	297300	Are you scared of fun? And we've been doing this as a group for a while. Does anyone know
297300	303620	how long we've been playing together? 18, 19 years. It hasn't been quite that long.
303620	307700	I'd divide that by three and I think we'd be about right. So how long did we play before
307700	311300	we started recording? It was like a year and a half. Yeah. We played for like two years,
311300	316860	I think before we started playing. And then season one was almost four years of recording.
316860	324700	We're going to cut that down. So we've been playing together for something like six years
324700	329220	now. From what I've heard on the internet, that is considered rare. How do you think
329220	334300	we've been able to keep it up by making a lot of the rules? Yeah, I would say the fact
334300	340780	that we generally have a great time together is what's going and the money. We have a Patreon
340780	352180	by the way. Yeah. And Hey, that money is not keeping me around yet. So maybe keep Thomas
352180	361620	around. Well, should that be a stretch goal? Keep Thomas. Oh man. I love this group. I love
361620	366620	this group because you're literally my, I was going to say best friends. You're my only friends.
366620	372500	But I also- Is that better or worse? It's the same dude. It sounded like a downgrade in the
372500	377460	middle of the sentence. He's stuck with us either way. Speaking of, you guys played three small
377460	382260	town cops last season. This season, we're not doing that. And we're also not playing Delta
382260	387220	Green agents. What are you guys up to this season? We'll say goodbye to the small town because we're
387220	391700	in the city. We're in the city, baby. We're going to the city. Do you want to know what happens in
391700	398940	the city? We can tell you. Newsworthy action and that's what we cover because we're a fucking news
398940	407220	team, y'all. An action news squad tooling around in our sweet van, bringing you all the news that's
407220	415140	fit to print. Wait, city action news van, the can van? The can van. Fuck yeah. First good improv of
415140	423620	the season. Actually, I have that written down right here in front of me. So thanks so much for
423620	432740	listening to this first episode of season two. And now let's turn that dial to 694.2 PTBP and hand it
432740	450740	over to Wolf the dog. Good afternoon, everybody. And I do literally mean everybody because we are
450740	461740	coming at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the city's oldest and only radio station. It's your sweaty
461740	469860	teddy bear with the news to share, Wolf the dog. It's a wet hot day here in the city this Saturday.
469860	479700	It's June 18th, 2022 if that means anything to you. And oh damn, there's an email in my inbox. Why,
479700	486100	it's a new Howlin' with Wolf. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from John Scott Tynes,
486940	492940	an American writer best known for his work on the role-playing games Unknown Armies,
492940	500180	Call of Cthulhu, Puppetland, and Delta Green. John tweeted about the show and tagged at
500180	508460	Pretending Pod, a very cool and very easy thing to do. He writes, I've got a message here from
508460	516100	high up on the down low. Hey, clockwork child, love your style. Watch out for minotaurs in the
516100	526140	labyrinth. Dr. Gonzo, keep on keeping it surreal. Jeff Hawthorne, hello and goodbye. Nice job keeping
526140	534940	ahead. And Florida man, master of the dude way. Rock that red beard and tell Jane hi. Blood and
534940	544500	kisses JC lens. Damn now y'all aren't even trying to make sense anymore. Does anyone know what in
544500	551300	the grease any of this means? Kids these days. If you want to write up something for your steamy
551300	558900	Wolf to howl, just tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram. Tag pretending to be people on
558900	566020	Facebook. Or if you want to be one of Wolf's favorites, submit a five star review on Apple

610900	619820	need to go folks. Find some wet debris and with a whole dose. We've got a brand new theme to warm
619820	627300	up your throats. It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
640900	670620	Our story begins on a sweltering, muggy Saturday in the city.
670860	681220	It's June 18th, 2022 and walking feels more like wading through a pool. But plenty of people are
681220	687820	parading up and down the perpendicular pathways that make up the city. Each intersection, four
687820	695820	perfectly 90 degree angles. Each street sign, splendidly shining in the sunlight. Each person
695900	703180	walking outside for more than 30 seconds, drenched. The severe and sterile design of the city helps
703180	708460	some folks keep their heads on straight, helps them keep a grip on their reality, but everyone's
708460	712940	different. Though I bet plenty of people would agree it'd be nice to be able to get an eyeful
712940	718460	of the city without being inundated with so many advertisements. Facebook, Olive Garden,
718460	725100	The Godel Company, Gucci, Amazon, The City News, Apple, Exxon Mobil. It's impossible.
725820	732140	They're everywhere. You say The Gobble Company? G-O-T-T-L-E. It's like Butterball. The Godel
732140	743500	Company is a food based company. They work on bio-farming. Wait, that ain't right. Bio-farming
743500	755660	is just farming? Yeah. Then yes. It's organic farming. Is it like growing a steak in a lab
755660	763740	or is it like growing a cow in a field? Honestly, it's more like growing corn in a field. Okay,
763740	768620	to feed the cows? That's just agriculture. Yeah, they're an agriculture, they're an ag company.
768620	772300	Hell yeah. Who's going to be the bad guy, do you guys think?
773740	777500	Zach was hoping he could just slip that Godel in there and we wouldn't mention anything and now
777500	786380	he's got the entire plot ruined. Even Luke took down a note on Godel.
787980	790300	I spelled it wrong and then I wrote over it, but I can tell.
791340	795660	Well, Luke, let's start with you. You're the producer, one of the segment producers
795740	800060	out in the field of City Action News. I want you to tell me about your character and what
800060	806700	they're up to on this oppressively moist Saturday afternoon. My character is Julius
806700	811580	Summers and you can do MFA after that if you want. Do I have to? It's preferred.
811580	815500	I'm getting an NBA vibe from this guy. No business, film and arts.
816700	822700	All right, what's Julius up to on this heater of a start of the weekend? Julius is
823500	831660	in his closet. He is color coding his suits. He's getting ready for his first real week
831660	833900	at Cannes. City Action News.
833900	837740	And he is super stressing out about which suit he's going to wear.
837740	841020	What are your options? Blue, tan or black.
841660	845900	He has 19 suits, various shades of blue, tan and black.
845900	848620	Do you mix and match or do you always keep it monochromatic?
848620	852300	Monochromatic and they're 90s fits.
852300	856380	Oh, anything else I need to know about Julius Summers?
856380	862220	He is starting at City Action News because nepotism, basically.
862220	867340	Speaking of, your uncle calls your cell phone. You get a vibration and the name says
867340	875020	Tyfe Ralen, T-Y-F-E, Ralen. Shout out to Jeff from Seattle. One of our patrons at the $10
875020	881180	above level has given us this character who is a six foot tall man with dark slicked back hair
881260	882940	and a permanent smirk.
882940	884220	Tyfe is a cool name.
884220	884860	It is cool.
884860	890220	Tyfe Ralen is the executive producer of the City Action News and he is
890220	892060	Julius Summers direct report.
895340	895900	Hello.
895900	899500	Hey, what the fuck is up? My beautiful baby nephew. Come on.
899500	902060	Huh? It's a beautiful day for overtime. Yeah.
903260	903760	Stucks.
904620	905180	Overtime.
906220	908060	Good. You keeping the talent happy?
908060	913100	Of course you are. All right. Well, get him, get the camera guy, get them all out to the,
913100	919420	get him out to a farm. Okay. Find a magnetic fucking farmer to do 90 seconds. Only 90 seconds.
919420	925420	Okay. On whether they would sell their land to the Godel company. I heard Fred Godel himself
925420	930300	is going around and closing these land deals in person. See what they think about that, right?
930300	934780	Okay. Just 90 seconds this time. Don't let him go all in depth like he likes to. Oh, and nephew.
935740	945580	Y'all gotta do a TikTok for the can. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm real serious this time. Okay. Yeah.
945580	949260	Yeah. You have to make a TikTok for the can. Can do.
949260	955980	Okay. Have fun. You're based for this bro. And he hangs up. Fuck. A farm in the city?
956700	957420	It's going to be hard.
957420	966700	He, uh, was standing there completely naked because he was trying to decide what to put on.
968460	972060	Who doesn't love a naked phone call with their uncle? It wasn't a FaceTime.
972060	977660	What's his dong like? Um, you see him from the back. So the dong, can you see the dong?
977660	981900	The dong has not been revealed, but he is standing with, he has no thigh gap. So he's standing.
981900	985820	There'd be no way to see the dong. He's thick. He's got, uh,
987420	993980	Julius Summers. Yeah. Big thighs. He ran in, in college and he ran even while he was getting his
993980	1001660	masters, which is weird. He big thighs, normal rest of his body. He throws on. So normal dong,
1001660	1006780	normal dong, normal calves, no more arms, no more torso, huge thighs, huge thighs,
1006780	1011420	but thick thighs. People are like, whoa, get it, get a load of those. Do they save lives?
1011420	1016540	They report on whether life was saved or not. Could he smash a watermelon with those bad boys?
1016540	1021740	He has before. And he'll do it again. Fun party trick in college. He just kind of like closes
1021740	1028700	his eyes and starts pointing around and then stops and he puts on a light tan suit with a tan
1028700	1036860	undershirt, a tan tie, tan pants and tan shoes. So everyone can see your sweat stains on this
1036860	1042460	super hot Saturday. He does, uh, throw on a couple tan undershirts. It's going to be hotter,
1042460	1048140	but it'll soak up as much sweat as possible. Grabs a cell phone, puts it in his pocket,
1048140	1054060	grabs the keys to the van, the city action news van, the can van, the can van. Where's it at?
1054060	1065100	The can van is a parked in front of Julius Caesar's. The can van is parked outside of Julius
1065100	1070140	Summers house, which is located right on the outskirts of town and the first like little
1070140	1078140	suburb. He runs out to the van and calls up the talent. All right, sick. So, uh, let's, uh,
1078140	1087740	let's dive in and see what Thomas's character is. As a character. When you get this phone call,
1087740	1093260	what are you up to? It's a hot Saturday in the city. Cal Colorado has definitely been
1093260	1098460	sitting by the phone waiting for a call from his producer. Cal Colorado?
1098460	1103580	Veteran newsman, Cal Colorado. Holy shit. And he's got, he's got a landline that rings
1104780	1109500	and he sets down his, his cup of black coffee and he picks up the receiver and he says,
1110380	1119980	hello, Cal Colorado. Awesome. Cal. Julius. We need to get ready. Ready for what? We are
1120540	1125020	going to the farm. Which farm? You can figure that out while I drive to come get you.
1125020	1132060	Cal hangs up confused. The producer doesn't know it's his job.
1134380	1140220	This is Saturday. Julius's first day, um, was on Friday just as like a, like, you know,
1140220	1145100	kind of get to know you thing. As soon as the phone is hung up, he's like, fuck that.
1145100	1153900	And he starts Googling farms near him and the, the can van pulls up on this sweltering hot day.
1153980	1159020	Honestly, the AC hasn't even kicked in to full gear at this point in time. Windows are kind
1159020	1163500	of rolled down while you've got the air flying through. Oh, I thought you meant the AC in Cal
1163500	1170940	Colorado's house because yes it has. It's very well maintained. Oh, what degree? 73. Character
1170940	1177580	development. Tell me about it stud. Oh, well 73 just seems a little more like I keep it at 69
1177580	1182060	cause that's funny and comfortable. It's expensive and hilarious.
1185420	1189980	But Cal Colorado keeps it at 73 no matter what time of year.
1191660	1196540	He pulls up in front of your house, apartment, high rise. Where are you? Where are you at?
1196540	1202940	Cal Colorado lives in a modest townhouse. Well-kept with a finely functioning air
1202940	1211340	conditioner. He sets down his cup of black coffee. He had TV on to like a competitor's network.
1211340	1216780	Awesome. He was idly like scratching his cat's ears. Can you tell me a little bit more about Cal?
1216780	1224380	Cal keeps a very neat home. Pretty small. It's just him. The tan line where his wedding ring was
1224380	1230940	is long gone. Really you can tell he's, he's a pretty simple guy. There's not a lot of flashy
1230940	1237020	accessories. There are a bunch of pictures along the entrance hall, like showing a long career.
1237020	1241820	Is it just him shaking hands with different people? It's him with Edward R. Moreau and Walter
1241820	1247900	Cronkite and Dan Rather on down to like Anderson Cooper. Starting out when he's just like clearly
1247900	1253820	like a pimply faced intern and going to now he's, uh, he's in his late fifties, tall man,
1253820	1260780	slim with well-kept but thinning hair. Is he a gray? Is he a gray? Is he a gray?
1261660	1267500	Spoilers. I'm about to blow this bitch wide open. Is he, uh, is he being controlled by amigo?
1269500	1275020	Didn't amigos get canceled? Are you guys still on the phone? When I said I'm gonna go get him,
1275020	1281180	I figured that was the end of the conversation. He's just describing his house to you. I'm like,
1281980	1288460	I am a simple man with austere possessions, but my memories are important to me.
1289820	1294780	And out the door, honk honk. Good afternoon, Julius. Are you ready to make some news?
1294780	1300540	I'm not sure how the last guy did it, but I'm sure I'll do just as well. Well,
1301420	1305580	Marvin left some pretty big shoes to fill, but you'll get the hang of things.
1305580	1311180	He just kind of nods and then he calls his camera man and heads to the camera guy's house.
1316380	1319180	Damn. He didn't answer the phone. Hold on.
1322460	1329580	It goes to voicemail. Hey, you've reached back. Uh, didn't get to the phone. Uh,
1329580	1332140	I guess you could try again cause I'm not calling you back.
1332780	1337180	Julius was going to leave a voicemail and then he hears that.
1341900	1347260	I keep driving to the camera guy's house. Uh, have, have you been to his house before? I
1347980	1354780	try not to go in, but yes. Is it that one? It's the one where the top floor is a little burned
1354860	1360060	out. Pull up to the house and then, uh, just jump out and go.
1362860	1370860	So inside the house, uh, you see Beck Wilder is laying a face down on his bed. Uh,
1370860	1377900	he is just in his tighty whities, pasty skin, uh, blonde hair, kind of medium length,
1377900	1384460	all messy from a fitful night of sleep. There are pizza boxes and energy drinks all over the floor.
1384860	1388300	And on a desk that has a bunch of computer monitors. When we say bed,
1388300	1392060	are we talking bed frame or mattress on the floor? Mattress on a floor. Uh,
1392060	1396700	he's on top of the sheets. Like he obviously just conked forward from a standing position
1400220	1406300	and uh, he starts to hear the pounding at the door in his dream. Oh, it's his mom has been
1406300	1412620	pounding on the door in his dream and he's been scared to answer it. And then he, oh, uh, uh,
1413260	1417980	oh shit. And he starts jumping up and he goes to his closet, he rips it open and there are
1417980	1424780	a variety of Hawaiian shirts are on the rack. But his favorite one is on the floor crumpled
1424780	1429100	and he wants to wear the favorite one. So he grabs it and sniffs it. It passes the test.
1429100	1434140	He throws it on, uh, he goes and opens the door and he still just got the tighty whities.
1434940	1439100	I really don't appreciate you making a character so obviously inspired by Luke and I.
1443580	1449900	Uh, Becca's bleary eye looking at you. Hey, uh, uh, hail Caesar. What's up dude?
1451100	1455820	Julius just kind of looks him up and down. The Caesar reference goes right over his head.
1456940	1460540	Yeah, I think we might've edited that part out. Nah, give unto summers what is summers.
1461420	1468220	Give. Is that some fucking newfangled translation? Render bitch. Oh, I, I wasn't allowed to read the
1468300	1475500	old one. Are you gonna put any pencil on? Oh shit dude. Hang on a sec. Hey,
1475500	1480940	this is a house is Dawn. Jesus. It's how tight are the whitey spilling out?
1484780	1487740	So he's standing there. Lenny Kravitzing in front of you.
1489340	1493660	Luke almost just spit out his shelter. The image immediately was perfect in my mind.
1493660	1500940	As he unfurls in front of you. Becca is still talking to you from inside the house.
1501740	1504700	Uh, so I mean like, why are you here man? Do we have something going on?
1504700	1510540	We're going to the farm. 90 seconds at the farm. All right man. Hang on a sec. And he's throwing
1510540	1515660	on a cargo shorts that have a lot of pockets. These are, these are the cargoiest of cargo
1515660	1520700	shorts. He's a real camera man. Shorts. These are real camera man shorts and he's grabbing,
1521260	1526300	first he grabs the leftover energy drink that's sitting on his desk and he takes a big swig of it
1526300	1529820	and realizes that it was from like five days ago and that wasn't the one he was drinking last
1529820	1536060	night. At least it wasn't one of the piss jugs. Also, I love that you know the difference in
1536060	1542300	tastes between a one day old energy drink and a five day old energy drink. Well, three days is the
1542380	1546220	perfectly aged Gatorade. He wipes the film off his teeth.
1548940	1551820	Yeah, that's an old one. And loads it into his camera.
1556620	1560540	Amongst this chaos though, you do see that like the computer desk that's strewn with
1560540	1564460	energy drinks and stuff, it's got the computer monitors and stuff. The actual computer monitors
1564460	1569580	and desk and stuff are impressive. It's a good high quality setup and kind of over in a corner
1569580	1573900	is where he keeps his camera equipment and it's the cleanest part of the house and he grabs two
1573900	1579100	cases. One's got the camera and one's got all of his accoutrement and he grabs a tripod and gets
1579100	1582860	it up under his arm and it's all a little disheveled as he's walking toward you. Alright
1582860	1588620	man, let's get going. Julius is already kind of overwhelmed with the day and just kind of
1588620	1593180	180s and heads back to the van. On the way out, he tries to get everything under one arm so he
1593180	1599180	can grab his lucky blue baseball cap, puts it on his head and meets you guys in the van. Hey, Cal!
1599180	1604300	Good morning, Beck. Good to see you, man! It's always a pleasure. So, uh, what are we doing?
1604300	1609740	We've got 90 seconds at the farm. You know where that is, right? Uh, the farm. I mean,
1609740	1615020	there's a lot of, uh, which, uh, I mean... Which one comes to your mind first?
1617020	1624540	The O'Carney Farm. Okay, let's get us there. Let's go. You, uh, you want me to drive?
1624540	1635660	Do you? He's got bloodshot eyes in it. Do you, uh, you want me to drive? I am actually good. Cal,
1635660	1640780	could you open the glove box? Cal is, like, kind of looking over his script and not really paying
1640780	1647820	attention and he's like, Beck is a fine driver. He would be an admirable choice. Julius opens the
1647820	1653820	glove box and he has some, like, cool, like, flame striped racing gloves in there and he puts those
1653820	1663260	on. He's like, I'm good. Cal raises a huge eye at those gloves. Just one? Eyebrow. Oh,
1664300	1669900	I thought he pulled his eye out, raised it into the air. Cal plucks his eye out of the socket
1669900	1675580	and raises it up closer to the steering wheel so he can get a good peek at Julius's sweet gloves.
1676140	1680140	Pedal to the metal for, like, two seconds and then, like, starts going the speed limit to the farm.
1681100	1687180	You peel out into a slo-mo. Into, like, a 35-40. Into a school zone.
1687180	1692220	Okay, you know that the O'Carney Farm is only a few miles out of town. Just a few mile markers
1692220	1697260	off the highway right outside of town. You're gonna hit a country road and then head off on a
1697260	1705740	two-lane farm road that, uh, shockingly has farms on either side of it. As you head down,
1705740	1710860	you see that the O'Carney Farm has a bunch of trucks and cars parked on the grass up by the
1710860	1718540	house, uh, and then to the left you see a, uh, a very quiet farm. Far, far less. Is it a bio-farm?
1720220	1723100	Are you gonna hit me with that every time I do this?
1725020	1727900	Well, it doesn't make any sense because I edited out my stupidity earlier.
1729900	1734140	No, it's there. You make me sound like the idiot. You just sound like you're genuinely asking,
1734220	1739580	oh, is it a bio-farm? On the left there's a really quiet farm. There's just one pickup truck hanging
1739580	1744540	out there. No one's out and about currently. And then on the right you see a farm, which is,
1744540	1748460	yeah, the O'Carney one, but it has a bunch of cars and trucks pulled up by the house.
1748460	1751580	More, more cars and trucks than should be pulled up at a farmhouse?
1751580	1755420	Oh yeah, I'm talking 30 cars and trucks up in front of this. Sorry.
1755980	1761500	On the way here, Beck has been putting together his camera equipment and he is now filming B-Roll
1761500	1765340	out the window. Awesome. I don't know if I should say it every time, but he, that's one of his
1765340	1769980	things is he's always filming. So think of that when you think of Beck. Think of that when you
1769980	1775340	think of Beck. Julius tries to pull the van up as close as possible to like where he thinks
1775980	1784540	a farmer would be. Do you see anybody standing with a pitchfork anywhere?
1784540	1792940	It's a nice long gravel road up to this farmhouse and parked in the grass. There are like upwards
1792940	1799340	of 30, maybe even 40 cars and trucks all haphazardly parked, but nice enough to where
1799340	1805020	no one is blocking anyone else in. As you guys approach, you see that there is a folding table
1805020	1813500	to the right of the farmhouse. And there is a man who is dressed to the farmer nines standing
1813500	1821260	behind it with a metal box in front of him with the lid wide open. He is very much a farmer,
1821260	1828220	what with overalls and a big straw hat, but you also see that he is wearing a full face mask,
1828940	1834380	like a luchador. Is it like crazy and fancy like a luchador mask or is it like... Yeah, it's got
1834380	1841180	corn all over it. For real? Yeah, it's like a corn-based luchador. Cartoon or realistic
1841260	1847180	depictions of corn? Let's go cartoon. Faces or just cartoony like clipart? Oh, it's just corn.
1847180	1854460	Faces? Like corn with faces. Is it corn people? Legitimately, my question is, was it a corn with
1854460	1863740	a face and arms and legs, a corn person? Oh, fuck. No, I like the thing I said. Corn-based
1863740	1869500	luchador mask. That's dope. Lots of kernels. And as you pull up, he's giving you a nice
1869500	1876700	friendly wave. I throw it in the park and I jump out. We're with CAN Action News. I guess I don't
1876700	1883820	have to say Action News because CAN stands for City Action News. Yes, I do. See that by the name
1883820	1891740	on the side of your van. Sir, could we borrow you for about 90 seconds? Welcome to Farm Wrestling.
1891740	1898700	Come on down. It's going to be a $5 entrance for each of you to see some Farm Wrestling. I'm the
1898700	1906060	tiller, which is funny for two reasons. One, I till the ground and till my opponent into the
1906060	1916060	ground. And two, I also fill up this till here with your $5. The tiller. I turn around and look
1916060	1922380	at Beck and Cal. Guys, I heard about this in college. I didn't think it was real. Farm Wrestling.
1923420	1928380	Beck is balancing the camera on his shoulder and trying to reach for a wallet in the cargo pants
1928380	1934460	because he's got to get that $5 out. Cal is motioning to Beck to put his wallet away while
1934460	1941180	he's just saying, a big black bug bit a big black bear. A big black bug bit a big black bear. Wow,
1941180	1950060	you nailed those. Julius turns back around to the tiller and hands him the CAN card. Oh, yes,
1950060	1954540	of course. And he pulls out his cell phone and attaches a little square on the bottom of it,
1954540	1961340	swipes and is like $15. You want to add a tip for the tiller? He looks at his companions.
1962220	1964700	It's crazy that you handed him a business card and he ran it.
1966940	1969980	Oh, it was a business card. No, I meant the credit card.
1969980	1974620	Oh, so you and I were on the same page. Why are we paying to cover your Farm Wrestling?
1974620	1978540	I don't know what you're here for. I thought you wanted to watch some Farm Wrestling.
1979260	1985260	No, no tip. Yeah, no one else did either, but it's worth a shot.
1990140	1995340	All right, welcome and enjoy your time inside. It's right around the back there.
1995340	1997580	Are you the owner? No, I'm the tiller.
2000620	2006300	You want to talk to Mario, call me if you want to talk to the owner and the real farmer of this
2006380	2009900	here farm. As he's saying that I'm kind of elbowing you and pointing at Mario.
2010940	2014780	From what I've seen, it's her. She's the Okarni that I know of.
2014780	2019740	Which is an old lady with blown out and dyed hair wearing an American gladiator
2019740	2022700	t-shirt with the sleeves cut off. Nice.
2022700	2026940	She seems to be in her mid-50s, maybe up to 60s. You're not quite sure.
2026940	2030220	Big old shout out to Curtis from Deez Moneys,
2030220	2037580	Iowa. A patron at the $10 or up level on patreon.com slash pretending pod for suggesting
2038380	2042700	a backyard wrestling arena. Thank you, Curtis.
2042700	2046940	Ma'am, did you hear what I asked the tiller? Oh, sorry. What are you guys here for?
2046940	2050460	Do you have 90 seconds to talk about the farm? As this conversation is happening,
2050460	2054220	Beck is going to already start setting up a tripod to see if he can get a good angle
2054220	2057900	of her just standing here. We don't even need to go anywhere in his eyes.
2057900	2060220	What is this for? City Action News.
2060220	2064140	Oh, yeah. And what would you like to talk about my farm for on the news?
2064140	2071420	Well, I'd like to save the specific questions for later, but it's about the company.
2071420	2074940	Fucking godels. Guys, I set it up. I think this is going to be good.
2074940	2077820	Beck is approaching her and attaching a lapel mic to her.
2078460	2081980	Would you mind just saying her name and spelling it for me?
2081980	2091980	Marielle O'Carney. Marielle, M-A-R-I-E-L-O-K-E-A-R-N-E-Y. Marielle O'Carney.
2092620	2098460	And she takes a massive swig from the bottle of Jim Beam that she had in her hand.
2098460	2102460	Nice. And then I just attach a lapel mic to Kal, but we've done this a thousand times.
2102460	2103740	We don't even need to communicate.
2103740	2105580	Kal is combing his hair as you do that.
2105580	2106220	Yeah, there you go.
2106940	2110940	Julius is like, thanks, ma'am, and grabs the bottle out of her hand and just kind of walks
2111420	2114620	inside of the camera. She accepts.
2114620	2117580	And like, as I'm walking off, I kind of like point her at the camera.
2118140	2123340	I go behind the camera and I'll do a, I'll go to you with a silently, a five, four.
2125900	2129820	I'm here at the O'Carney farm. Not many trains come by through.
2135580	2138140	Hey guys, fuck it. Let's cut it again.
2138140	2141180	Hold on. I'm sorry.
2142780	2143580	Got a piss.
2143580	2145180	We're doing a lot of pissing.
2145180	2148460	That's what we're good for here. An old P-T-B-P.
2150300	2151340	Stands for pissing.
2152460	2155820	We're, uh, we're going one at a time. I just decided that.
2155820	2156380	Pissing.
2156380	2156940	Pissing.
2156940	2158460	The best piss.
2161020	2162300	Pissing the best piss.
2162300	2163420	Pissing the best piss.
2164300	2165100	Farm wrestling.
2168140	2173100	That's one of the words that you use to warm up.
2173100	2173600	Yeah.
2174780	2177500	Cal, I love it too, but that's not why we're here.
2179020	2181580	I'm here at the old O'Carney farm.
2181580	2186380	Muriel O'Carney has been running this place with her family for four generations.
2186940	2191100	But now, thanks to changing times, she's forced to do the unthinkable.
2191740	2196700	She hosts violent combats on her property just to make ends meet.
2196700	2200540	Muriel, when did these farm wrestling matches begin?
2200540	2207020	I wanted these men to all meet each other and have a nice place to wrestle for fun.
2207020	2213260	My son, Mitch, is a big fan of wrestling and he loves his wrestling mask.
2213260	2220540	He actually, he loves his wrestling mask so much at a young age, he started having sex with it.
2220540	2226780	And then eventually, the mask actually became pregnant and had a baby.
2228140	2232060	I didn't even know he was fucking his mask, but now it's apparent.
2232940	2237900	Cal is a professional, so he's kind of like motioning to his crew like,
2237900	2239980	we gotta cut all this, we gotta cut all this.
2239980	2244860	In the footage, you would see that the camera dips down kind of wildly when she dropped the curse word.
2245820	2247420	It's pointed at the ground right now.
2247420	2252540	She's kind of like laughing to herself and her eye is kind of like twitching a little bit.
2252540	2256780	You can tell that she is intoxicated, even though she's very good at holding her liquor.
2258540	2261980	Muriel, maybe we steer more towards the Godel company.
2262540	2263580	Yeah, okay.
2263580	2267180	The camera comes back up and he gives you another quick count in, it starts at three.
2267180	2272300	And ma'am, my producer didn't mention it, but you should probably watch the language.
2272300	2275500	Oh yes, so sorry, sir, Mr. Colorado.
2276060	2277020	Oh, a fan.
2277020	2279100	Yeah, good to see you on top still.
2279980	2283260	A pretty sharp pained look comes across Cal's face.
2283820	2286860	It's quickly replaced by a professional smile.
2286860	2292860	And he says, Muriel, many local farmers are selling out their land to the Godel company,
2292860	2294700	a major player in agribusiness.
2294700	2296860	You are one of the last holdouts in the area.
2296860	2297740	What keeps you here?
2299500	2303420	For that, I guess I'd have to walk you back if you'd like.
2303420	2304380	Come on back here.
2304380	2309260	And she kind of motions the camera and you as well toward the back of the farmhouse.
2309260	2312860	Beck goes ahead and takes the camera off the tripod, but he's following your guys's lead.
2313580	2315980	Cal Colorado is going to stay in the frame no matter what he does.
2315980	2320220	Come with us as we explore a vanishing lifestyle in this America.
2320220	2324860	As you guys pass around the back of the farmhouse, you see that there is a tarp
2325500	2332300	strewn over the back door as a makeshift tunnel for wrestlers to make their entrances.
2332380	2339900	And there is a farm DIY wrestling ring set up right near this tarped tunnel
2339900	2348940	in which there is a wrestler dressed as a crab, also wearing a luchador mask with the sign of,
2349820	2352300	I don't know, the cancer sign for...
2352300	2353740	Which one's the 69?
2353740	2354540	That's the one.
2354540	2356860	He's got a big old 69 on his face, I guess.
2356860	2357500	Gemini, right?
2357500	2358220	Oh, wait, what?
2358220	2359260	I thought that was the crab.
2359260	2360860	Well, one's his moon, one's his son.
2360860	2362220	Oh, I hate it.
2362220	2364540	I don't know what any of it is.
2364540	2366140	Yeah, cancer is the 69.
2367980	2368620	Oh, nice.
2368620	2369420	Yeah, cut me out.
2371100	2376380	So on the mask, the 69 is around the two eyes, but besides that, fully dressed as a crab,
2376380	2378540	even including claws on his hands.
2378540	2383420	The other wrestler is extremely patriotic, just stars and stripes all the way through.
2383980	2390220	And she leads you back there and she yells out to this crowd of 50 to 80 people.
2391020	2393980	What do you guys think about the Godel company?
2395180	2399900	The entire crowd turns and looks at Mariel with reverence.
2400700	2401980	They all start chanting.
2403100	2405020	Fuck Fred Godel!
2406940	2408620	Fuck Fred Godel!
2410380	2411980	Fuck Fred Godel!
2414540	2417740	I'm looking at Beck and I'm like, stoked, just stoked.
2417900	2421420	Beck is doing a panning shot of all the crowd.
2421420	2424860	And then toward the end of the panning shot, he's getting really up close to one of the
2424860	2430300	more vehement, sweaty, spittle, coming out of the mouth shots of a person who's just
2430300	2431900	red-faced and angry yelling this.
2431900	2432380	Oh, yeah.
2432380	2439020	And she's got pigtails on the top of her head on either side, and she's just screaming
2439020	2443420	into the camera, Fuck Fred Godel!
2443420	2448380	So I would say that's what I think about the Godel company.
2449020	2450220	Powerful words.
2450220	2453740	Beck hears that she is now talking again on his headphones, that he's always got around
2453740	2455660	his neck at the least, but they're on his ears at this point.
2455660	2458780	So he whips back around to get her in frame with Cal.
2458780	2460700	What do you think about that, Cal?
2461660	2463260	I'm not paid to think, ma'am.
2463260	2464540	I'm paid to report.
2464540	2466780	Well, did we give you what you need?
2466780	2468060	Oh shit, 90 seconds.
2468620	2469980	Wrap it up, wrap it up.
2469980	2476860	No, very little of what you presented to us here today is usable or fit for network television.
2476860	2477420	Did you pay?
2478220	2478700	Yes.
2478700	2481260	Well, you're free to stick around if you want to.
2481260	2483420	And she walks back to the wrestling ring.
2483420	2486860	The camera more focuses on you and starts to zoom a little.
2486860	2491820	A confusing scene here in the countryside outside the city, at once a mix of vibrant
2492380	2493100	folk culture.
2495100	2496220	Where does he want to go with this?
2496460	2500780	I mean, you don't have a teleprompter here.
2500780	2504620	So give me some outlines so I can script some of these in advance.
2505820	2506860	What we're going to be doing.
2506860	2509660	If I'm being honest, I had no idea this was going to happen.
2509660	2511580	Oh, you didn't know we were going to farm wrestling?
2511580	2512860	No, I knew you were going to farm wrestling.
2512860	2514780	I had no idea they were going to be so abrasive.
2516860	2517820	That was your call.
2517820	2518620	Yeah, it felt right.
2521340	2522380	Doesn't mean I planned it.
2522940	2524140	Anything for it.
2524140	2527500	You guys are going to be a news crew and you're going to go and interview people, but they
2527500	2528460	don't want to be interviewed.
2529980	2532700	That actually, that actually is what, what Cal addresses.
2532700	2538220	He, he motions to Beck to like put the camera down and he, he approaches like Muriel without
2538220	2538940	the microphone.
2539740	2543740	Ma'am, you have an opportunity to get your side of the story out today.
2543740	2551100	Now, so far with the profanity and well, frankly, a lot of those men are covered in blood.
2551100	2552940	We can't show that on our family network.
2553660	2555980	Do you want to give us something we can use?
2556620	2561580	She sighs and I'd like you to roll persuade.
2561580	2563100	First roll.
2563100	2565180	First roll of the second season.
2568300	2569660	It's an 86.
2571100	2575740	He has an 80 persuade, but he doesn't quite make it.
2575740	2577580	Well, let's talk about luck real quick.
2577580	2583420	I have given you each a one point of luck to start this campaign with.
2583420	2585980	And when I say point, I mean that you have luck.
2586700	2590700	We are doing luck in a slightly different way than we've played in the past.
2590700	2595820	So it might take us a little bit to remember it all, but you either have luck in this game
2595820	2598060	or you do not have luck in this game.
2598060	2604860	If you do have luck, then when you roll after you've rolled, if you would like to use your
2604860	2609820	luck, you can switch your tens dice and your what's the other one called?
2609820	2610540	Hundreds.
2610540	2612620	No, single single.
2612620	2613260	Singles.
2613260	2614380	Your ones dice.
2614380	2619580	You can switch the tens and the singles dice in order to perhaps create a success.
2620140	2627020	In this situation, the 86 would indeed turn into a 68 and that would lend itself to a success.
2627020	2633180	Also, I will be giving luck for sweet character play and moments.
2633260	2635660	Please ask me for luck if I don't give it to you.
2636860	2638300	And the kissing thing, right?
2638300	2639580	You told us about the kissing thing.
2642140	2645900	That if we gave you a kiss after the session, you'd give us our luck back.
2645900	2647580	And what did I say about that kiss, Joe?
2647580	2648300	It had to be good.
2649740	2650540	It had to be sweet.
2652540	2653100	Tonguey.
2653100	2654940	He said sweet like cherry pie, I think.
2654940	2663500	So that's a pretty easy way to do it.
2663500	2665740	I was banking on that because I did that anyway.
2665740	2667500	I had a garlicky breakfast.
2669020	2672780	It's unfortunate you did that, Joe, because you did already have the luck starting out.
2672780	2675820	So just think of it as practice.
2675820	2677340	A wasted sweet little kiss.
2679500	2680220	It wasn't wasted on me.
2680220	2682700	I'm going to spend that luck, turn that into a 68.
2682700	2690940	As Cal sees his words fall flat, he just gives her a huge wink with his piercing blue eyes.
2693660	2696940	The animal magnetism switches something in her brain.
2696940	2698220	That's the Cal I know.
2700060	2701500	Cal can be on top.
2701500	2702860	And she looks up at you.
2702860	2703360	Again.
2704700	2705340	Damn it, Cal.
2706540	2708700	I miss you being the anchor, Cam.
2708700	2710380	I do too, Mrs. O'Carney.
2710380	2713820	All right, well, let's go over here with a nice shot of the farm in the background
2713820	2716220	and say something nice for the people, huh?
2716220	2717660	I would surely appreciate that.
2721420	2726060	Beck follows her lead and he notices that she's got a good eye for what is pretty on her farm.
2726060	2728940	She set herself up in a good spot with rolling fields behind her.
2730220	2732940	The edge of the farmhouse is there to get a sense of perspective.
2732940	2735340	She set up a nice shot and I follow her lead.
2735340	2737660	The corn is swaying in the breeze.
2737660	2738940	Crabs are walking by.
2739820	2742780	It's a corn and crab farm.
2743340	2743840	Right.
2744460	2746940	That's why the wrestlers were corn and crab guys.
2748620	2753500	I'm not selling my damn farm to no Godel.
2753500	2754860	All right, let's do this.
2754860	2756060	Mariel O'Carney.
2756060	2758620	This farm has been in your family for four generations.
2759260	2763420	The Godel company has been purchasing many of your neighbor's properties.
2763420	2765260	You are the last holdout in the area.
2765900	2767020	What keeps you here?
2767020	2769580	Well, I'll tell you one thing, Cal.
2769580	2777660	I don't appreciate someone who has been given everything that they have coming in
2777660	2785820	and trying to use that privilege to buy up what is rightfully mine
2785820	2790140	and has been, like you said, in my family for four generations.
2790940	2795340	I am not going to sell to Fred Godel because I do not trust him.
2795340	2798060	I think he is a snake of a businessman
2798060	2803180	and I think he is bad for both the economy and the world at large.
2803180	2804460	Kind of leans in and he's like,
2804460	2809420	could you just say the Godel corporation instead of Frank Godel?
2809420	2813980	Well, Frank is Fred's dad who actually put in the work.
2814700	2817500	I would respect it if Frank was around,
2817500	2822140	but he's no longer mentally capable to run the Godel company,
2823020	2827180	which is why his idiot son has taken over.
2827180	2828700	Sorry, I'll do that again.
2829740	2832780	I don't want to sell my land to the Godel company
2832780	2834700	because they are ruining America.
2835260	2837260	As she stares straight down the camera.
2838300	2840620	How are they ruining America?
2840620	2845580	In my opinion, they are taking the ability to make a living for oneself
2845580	2850860	out of the hands of those of us who have been doing the living for ourselves for generations
2850860	2852780	and feeding America.
2852780	2858300	Are you comfortable, Cal, with one person being in charge of feeding America?
2858300	2861740	Julius is doing the wrap this up, don't answer that.
2863820	2865500	No, Cal was never going to answer that.
2865500	2866860	Are you dodging the question, Cal?
2867420	2868620	Are you not here for the truth?
2869260	2871180	Ma'am, I am only here for the truth,
2871180	2874140	but I'm not the one who answers the questions.
2874700	2878300	I ask the questions and the people seem to think I do a pretty good job.
2879580	2880780	Can I ask you a question?
2881180	2883420	Yeah, Colorado, you can ask me a question.
2885980	2887740	Hold on, I got to think of a question now.
2887740	2891660	I was going to mention, ask her opinion on her neighbors selling their land.
2891660	2893100	Does she fault them for it?
2893100	2894060	Great question.
2894060	2897340	And maybe even why she thinks that they sold, that kind of thing.
2897340	2897840	Yeah.
2898300	2901820	Do you fault your neighbors who have already sold to the Godel company?
2901820	2902460	Good question.
2906140	2906860	Hey, thanks, Zach.
2906860	2912780	No, unfortunately I don't.
2913740	2914860	It's none of my business.
2915500	2917340	They can do with their land what they want to do.
2917340	2919420	I'm going to do it my land, what I want to do.
2919420	2920620	Are any of them here today?
2921340	2921840	Yeah.
2922540	2925820	And she points over at one of the guys watching the match.
2926700	2929340	He's just dressed in like super normal clothes.
2929340	2930540	He's car hearted out.
2931180	2933020	That's a typhus.
2933980	2937100	We already have typhus.
2937100	2938060	Oh, sorry.
2938060	2938940	Typhoid barge.
2940620	2942540	We're playing Star Wars, right?
2942540	2943040	Exactly.
2946540	2947660	Typhoid barge.
2948780	2950620	Such a good Star Wars name.
2950620	2951180	That's great.
2951980	2953260	Cholera candlestick.
2954780	2955740	Yeah, there's a...
2955740	2956700	That's the lupus mcmanus.
2958940	2959740	It's never lupus.
2959740	2961580	Well, Jesse's over there.
2962460	2966220	He sold the lemon farm like a week ago.
2966220	2969020	Muriel, is there anything else you want the people to know?
2969020	2969520	No.
2970060	2974940	You are doing the wrap up thing you were saying earlier and Beck is doing the stretch out thing.
2977500	2980060	Like kneading dough above your head.
2980060	2982060	Pulling it out, pulling it outward.
2982060	2983420	Oh yeah, that's not kneading.
2983420	2985740	Julius goes around you to not get in the shot,
2985740	2989500	but he goes over and is going to go talk to Mr. Lemon.
2989500	2990220	Nice.
2990220	2993420	As Julius Summers approaches, Jesse, Lemon.
2998540	3002060	Wow, you'd go just not far outside the city and people get real country.
3004060	3005500	Real fucking over the top.
3006220	3007900	We're just over the train tracks.
3009340	3010620	Did you hear that tiller guy?
3012220	3016060	That tiller guy sounds like he fucking lives in the swamps in Louisiana.
3017180	3018620	One of those contention hicks.
3019580	3022220	As you guys are like making your way around,
3022220	3025100	you hear him talking in his normal voice to someone.
3027500	3031820	So anyway, I am called the tiller because not only do I till my soil,
3031820	3033340	but I also control the till.
3035100	3036060	Succinctly said.
3036620	3038380	To which Jesse Lemon's response.
3042860	3045980	You sure do control the shit out of that till tiller.
3046860	3047740	Yee-haw.
3047740	3048540	Do you touch him?
3049180	3049500	Sorry.
3053820	3055180	That's a leading question.
3056140	3059020	How do you approach Jesse Lemon?
3060060	3060780	Do you touch him?
3060780	3061500	Do you touch him?
3062540	3063100	Objection.
3064300	3064860	Leading the win.
3064860	3066860	As you caress the small of his back.
3069500	3071420	You walk up behind him and blow on his neck.
3071420	3076700	Big circle, little circle, question mark dot.
3077340	3077980	Open up.
3077980	3079100	Did you guys ever do that?
3079100	3081340	Was it make the chills happen on the back of somebody?
3082140	3083020	Carry on Luke.
3083020	3085340	I didn't know if that was like your alphabet trick for eating pussy.
3086700	3089900	Big circle, little circle, question mark dot.
3096300	3098380	Julius walks up to Jesse Lemon.
3099500	3101180	He tries to whistle, but he can't.
3101180	3106380	Julius is like super intrigued by the like wrestling match.
3106380	3109820	So he walks up to Lemon and what are these guys' names?
3111660	3115100	We got miss cap and crustacean down there.
3115100	3118060	And cousin Sam.
3118060	3119020	And cousin Sam.
3121020	3123660	We got cap and crustacean versus cousin Sam.
3124220	3125740	Sir, what do you like to be on TV?
3125740	3127660	Oh, about what now?
3127660	3131020	I hear that you recently came in to a lot of money.
3131180	3133100	And that's what you would like to talk to me about?
3133100	3135980	Well, specifically, the decision to do that.
3136860	3137900	I said a lot of money.
3137900	3139260	What do I need to tell you about?
3139260	3140540	I made a lot of money.
3140540	3142940	Cal will be asking you some questions.
3142940	3144860	Cal reaches out and spits you with a shake.
3144860	3147100	Cal Coran!
3147100	3150700	And he spits in his hand and then shakes with his other one.
3150700	3154300	He spits in his left hand and shakes you with his right hand like a normal person.
3155820	3157900	Cal gamely spits in his left hand and shakes.
3158140	3159820	Yeah, that's sick!
3160860	3162460	Because he's got the personal touch.
3162460	3164780	Beck has got the camera set up and he's lapeled you.
3164780	3167820	And if I could just get you to say and spell your name, please.
3167820	3173260	Yeah, that's right, J-C-D-E-A-J-C, Lemon, spelled like a fruit.
3173260	3177180	I like to think that the background is literally just the wrestling ring.
3177180	3177980	Oh, yeah.
3177980	3179020	Yeah, that's good.
3179020	3180860	He's already looking at the camera and he's like,
3180860	3187580	I sold all my property for a whole lot of money.
3187900	3189100	To the God Company!
3189100	3190300	Thank you, God Company!
3190860	3194540	Beck, after he lets him finish and then says to him,
3194540	3197500	if you'll address your questions to Cal there,
3197500	3199180	he's the one that's going to be talking to you.
3199180	3200620	You don't have to look down the barrel.
3200620	3204140	Okay, before we start, making sure everybody's ready.
3204140	3205100	Headphones on.
3205100	3207580	Beck is momentarily like, fuck, do I have them on?
3207580	3210780	And he goes and pats, yeah, we're good to go.
3210780	3211260	Okay.
3211260	3217100	Immediately, you see Jesse has a streak of terror run through
3217100	3220860	his entire body, his face goes pale and he starts sweating
3220860	3227100	as he's just staring at the headphones that are on the ears of Beck Wilder.
3227100	3228860	Why did I bring up the headphones?
3228860	3235820	Beck goes to swat at him, do I got something on me?
3236380	3237740	Hey, bro, tell me what's going on.
3237740	3241900	Every time you're touching him, he's just kind of like squirming as he's standing.
3241900	3243820	It's like a physical reaction.
3243820	3246380	Beck takes him fully off to look at him.
3246380	3248940	As you're holding him closer, he backs up.
3248940	3253900	Beck notes that and he just slowly puts them back onto his head
3254940	3257820	and then does hands up like they're done.
3257820	3265100	You see in Jesse's eyes that he is not aware of the terror that just struck across him.
3265100	3270540	And he looks at Cal and he says, are you ready for an interview or what are we doing here?
3270540	3273500	Mr. Lemon, do you have some issue with our equipment?
3273500	3275180	Which part of the equipment?
3275180	3276780	Beck's headphones?
3276780	3281660	As you say the word headphones, he shudders to the point where he almost falls over
3281660	3283900	and is like, wow, sorry about that.
3283900	3285900	Yeah, Cal reaches out to steady him.
3285900	3288940	I've been having a bit of drinking today, having some fun.
3288940	3291660	It's Saturday afternoon straw.
3291660	3293420	Can I human this reaction?
3293420	3293980	Yeah, of course.
3294940	3296780	64, which is a pass.
3296780	3299980	It's a pass because you rolled under your skill of?
3299980	3300460	70.
3300460	3301260	Fantastic.
3301260	3308140	And so as you pass, you see that there is a pure unconscious terror in this man
3308140	3313660	directed toward headphones for some reason that he is not seemingly aware of.
3313660	3314700	Yeah, well, we've all been there.
3316940	3319100	Mine do have demon faces painted on the sides.
3320540	3321580	Mr. Lemon.
3321580	3322620	Name's Jesse.
3322620	3323980	Thank you so much for having me.
3325020	3328700	Tell us if you would, why you sold to the Godel company?
3328700	3335740	Well, you offer me a lot of money and you don't see a Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos
3335740	3338300	or a Fred Godel around very often.
3338300	3338940	Now, do you?
3338940	3343100	When it came to my property and made me do, I couldn't quite refuse you.
3343100	3344060	Not good at that.
3344060	3345740	What sort of deal did you make?
3345740	3348060	Well, you offered me a whole lot of money.
3348060	3352140	Not going to tell you how exactly much, but enough to where I was ready to sell pretty
3352140	3353340	much merely.
3353340	3355500	Between you and me, Mr. Lemon.
3355500	3356700	How much money was it?
3356780	3360220	Well over what it is worth, in my opinion.
3360220	3364620	Was it well over what it was worth in a real estate assessor's opinion?
3364620	3368380	My goodness, you are a very prickly fellow, are you not?
3368380	3370060	When it comes to money, I will tell you.
3370060	3371980	You seem like a nice man, I'll just tell you.
3372700	3377820	My farm is roughly estimated to be worth about 1.2 million dollars.
3377820	3381500	This man came into my own home and offered me 2.5.
3381500	3383100	A generous offer to be sure.
3383180	3387580	Indeed, it's enough for me to live off of for the rest of my life.
3387580	3389020	If you invested wisely.
3389020	3390060	Well, I doubt that.
3393180	3393900	Fair enough, Mr. Lemon.
3393900	3397980	My money don't go in no bank, my money don't go in no crypto.
3397980	3399740	My money stays right with me.
3399740	3403660	Julius Summers is trying to imagine how many jet skis this guy has bought.
3405260	3408060	Is Julius Summers also thinking about how much crypto he could buy?
3408620	3409900	2.5 million?
3410460	3413340	And it's way more than he currently owns, which is still a lot.
3414780	3416700	This is June 18th, it's not the past.
3416700	3419260	Crypto is crashing right now.
3419260	3423340	Right, he has deleted his crypto app off of his phone so that he doesn't look at it.
3424940	3426140	Oh, is that a little...
3426140	3427420	That's actually Luke.
3427420	3429820	Is that a Luke detail?
3429820	3433660	I diversify my portfolio across my pockets.
3433660	3436300	Well, that is a folksy if impractical method.
3437260	3438940	Do we have anything else we want to ask this guy?
3439660	3444140	Does he have to leave or are they paying him to maintain the land now?
3444140	3445500	As surfs.
3445500	3448380	Mr. Lemon, what does the Godel company want with your land?
3448380	3450380	Are you still on it or have you moved?
3450380	3453580	He gave me about a month to get everything cleaned up.
3453580	3454700	You see, I'm right over there.
3454700	3460300	He points across the street where his old pickup truck is the only thing seen on his property.
3460300	3462380	He's like, yeah, I'm just literally right there.
3462380	3465980	So I'm just selling off all my equipment.
3465980	3468540	They said they didn't want none of it, they just want the land.
3468620	3475420	So I'm just selling everything else off and then I'm going to take off to who knows where, maybe Greece.
3475420	3478620	Is there anything growing on the Lemon farm right now?
3478620	3478860	No.
3479500	3481740	No, it's not a crab in corn form.
3482380	3482700	Damn.
3484460	3490460	One of the crab tanks is broken and some of our carnies crabs are scuttling across the road.
3490460	3491340	Some of them make it.
3491900	3492860	Some of them frogger.
3492940	3498620	Jesse Lemon's off to explore Greece.
3498620	3504700	The Godel company gave me myself lemon and I'm going to go to Greece and make lemonade.
3504700	3505260	That was rad.
3506060	3508220	Bec's giving you like enthusiastic thumbs up.
3508220	3511020	Yeah, Julius is doing the like, that was perfect.
3511020	3515900	Cal is stoked that he said that and just says, Mr. Lemon, enjoy the wrestling.
3515900	3519420	Cal, Colorado reporting from Okarni Farm.
3519420	3520460	And we're out.
3520460	3536220	Do you think you can edit that to 90 seconds?
3550460	3566620	Jesse Lemon, how do you eat pussy?
3566620	3569260	Question Mark Dye puts a little baby in a spiral.
3570860	3575660	And I'm a big fan of Kendrick Lamar.
3575660	3578380	Question Mark Dye puts baby in a spiral.
3580460	3584220	Now all that pussy talk has to stay in.
3586220	3589340	Not all of it.
3589340	3592460	Just a taste.
