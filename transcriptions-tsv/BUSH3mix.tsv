0	4400	Well, well, well, hello there once again.
4400	11200	Fancy catching you here at this place we call the Radio Waves.
11200	14080	Come on in and have yourself a seat.
14080	18240	Stay a while, listen to me, Wolf the Dog.
18240	27280	Broadcast from 694.2 PTBP, the greatest radio station ever by galactic mile.
27280	31440	That's like a country mile, but for space.
31440	36080	Speaking of great things, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Zach,
36080	42960	out in Ventura County, California, who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.
42960	46320	Hey, listener, what a fine idea, hmm?
46320	51040	Just a little tweet to tell your friends that you're the kind of freak
51040	55520	that don't shy away from the horrors of at Pretending Pod.
55520	61360	Sounds pretty cool to me, thanks Zach from Ventura County, California.
61360	62640	Zach writes,
62640	66240	Hey Wolf, love you and everyone on the show.
66240	71360	For anyone listening in SoCal looking for their own furry critter companion,
71360	74400	check out the Ventura County Animal Shelter.
74400	81200	They got dogs, cats, rabbits, and all manner of cute cuddly critters looking for homes.
81200	86960	No unnatural horrors, just members of the coalition you haven't met yet.
86960	91120	You never know when you'll need a friend to tell you to hide in the creek.
91120	93040	Thank you for all your hard work.
93040	95760	Can't wait to see what's next in season two.
96720	101360	Well, thanks for writing in, Zach, about these dang good animals.
101360	106560	I share a special bond with all creatures of all dimensions,
106560	111360	and a cool name, Zach, if it's even a real name.
111360	114880	I don't know a single human being named Zach.
114880	118880	Zach is a fake name invented by the Illuminati.
118880	123280	If you know anyone named Zach, report them to the agency.
123840	126000	Do not approach a Zach.
126000	129600	Do not lock eyes with any of them.
129600	131920	They do not exist in this space.
132560	136720	They are from elsewhere that does not exist.
137360	140400	If you want to write up something for your wolf to how,
140400	142880	tag at pretending pod on the internet.
142880	145120	All of our links are in the show notes.
145120	149200	And if you really like this show, like you like like this show,
149200	154400	and you want to show it by showering us with $6 and 66 in coins,
154400	157360	mostly dimes, at least one penny,
157360	161280	you'll be pleased to know that one of those links down there in the show notes
161280	166000	is to our Patreon at patreon.com slash pretending pod.
166000	169920	That money buys Papa Wolf the special grease.
169920	174480	This month, you'll get to hear the PTBP boys break down some mistakes
174480	178320	that were edited out of their recent run of control copy.
178320	181840	In a Patreon exclusive bonus episode that Zach,
182480	186560	not a real name, is calling how to be a bad GM.
186560	188400	You won't want to miss this one.
188400	192560	It's over an hour of laughing at that dumb ass Zach's mistakes
192560	196480	while he desperately tries to learn how to do better next time.
196480	200880	But if hyperbolic headlines aren't your thing, don't worry.
200880	202480	It's time for the news.
203040	208240	Last time, Dr. Rusty Hooch, the never missed scientist.
208240	212400	Dr. Olivia Miller, the sad single mom surgeon.
212400	216800	Doreen Maureen, the iPad scrolling Pinterest lady
216800	222400	and the refrigerated pocket having basic training dropout, the Chuckster.
222400	228320	They went to a corrugated metal hunting cabin in the middle of the Arkansas woods,
228320	235200	posing as Dr. Ann Falsom, the Bigfoot scientist and friend to B-U-S-H
235200	240080	in order to retrieve the corpse of an unnatural creature.
240080	243680	However, when Dr. Ann Falsom and her team
243680	246640	entered the headquarters of Bigfoot underground,
246720	250160	search and hunt, the air was sucked out of the room.
250160	256960	Bleeding out on a tarp on a pool table was not the corpse of any sort of Bigfoot,
256960	262800	but rather it was the bruised and bullet-riddled body of a 12-year-old boy.
262800	268480	And as Carl Lambert growled in confusion, it became clear to everyone else
268480	273040	that this dead boy on the table was somehow Michael Lambert,
273040	276400	Carl's brother who weren't missing over 30 years ago.
276960	280080	Something about that math just don't add up.
280080	287120	But that's family for you, always complex, emotional and time-bending.
287120	291680	Here's a brand new track that hits that same familial trinity.
291680	296240	It's Molly Healy with Circles.
303040	315040	Searing star, deafening heat, you don't know why you found it.
315040	331040	In this fate as your widest portion, you'd better learn how to keep it.
333040	337440	I don't know how old you guys are.
337440	340000	You strike me roughly my age, but I don't know.
340000	341120	I don't want to assume.
341120	342000	How old are you guys?
342000	342480	Almost 30.
342480	343360	Sub 30?
343360	345520	Yeah, we're about to turn 30.
345520	346800	And then Allie's 19.
346800	348480	I'm so, I'm 24.
350400	351200	I'm the baby.
352480	357040	Well, I mean, I'm happy then that you, because you recently came out of the closet, right?
357040	360960	So, uh, because I was like, if you're over 30, I'm like, oh man, what a,
360960	363440	so many years you, you lost out on pussy.
365600	368800	How much pussy would you have gotten in homeschool?
371120	372000	Actually a lot.
372000	372800	They're all gay.
375520	376160	Amazing.
377520	379360	I think Allie's pussy game's strong.
386000	388240	It sounded better coming out of her mouth than mine.
391520	397280	Let's talk about your characters and what situation they are currently in.
397280	401920	I think things ended interestingly.
401920	405920	So I'd like to dive into each of your minds for a quick moment.
406800	412480	As you've lost either one sanity for three of you or five sanity for the Chuckster.
416400	419120	Is there anything going on in the Chuckster's mind
419120	424720	other than just cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
424720	430800	As you are looking at this, uh, I assume that the, the flood of chemicals to your brain
430800	436960	that is just shutting you down right now is enough to make it hard to, uh, to assess the
436960	437680	situation.
437680	442160	But I just want to know what's going on in that, in that little fucking pea brain.
442880	450720	I think, uh, the Chuckster has always had the ability to like, I don't know, think everything's
450720	451120	chill.
451120	452400	Everything's fine.
452400	457360	Like even when bad things happen, like getting kicked out of basic training, he's just like,
457360	462480	it's cool, crack a brew and move on with my life and it's all good and everything's happy.
462480	467200	But this is the first time where he's like faced with his own mortality, that something
467200	468960	bad could actually happen to him.
468960	473280	And he does have a very close relationship with his parents, but he has been lying to
473280	477120	them because he wants them to be proud of his accomplishments.
477120	484560	And he's feeling this, I might not measure up and this might be the end and maybe I need
484560	486240	to take things more seriously.
486240	486800	Damn.
486800	488160	That's like really internal.
488160	490880	I was just like, yo, what happened to the Bigfoot?
490880	492640	And you're like, I have to change my life.
495440	498320	I think I'm going to start, uh, doing yoga.
498320	499920	I think that's what he's thinking about.
499920	505280	I got to start, I'm going to start washing my vegetables before I eat them.
505280	508800	Because maybe they have vegetables.
508800	509440	Yeah, that's true.
509440	511920	Maybe I need to figure out what vegetables are.
513760	516160	What's going through Dr. Olivia Miller's mind?
516160	522960	Normally, I think she would, um, be able to separate her professionality with her emotions,
522960	526080	like, because she's seen so many, so many dead bodies in her life.
526080	531280	And also, you know, you know, people coming in from accidents and gnarly shit like that.
531280	535680	Uh, so I think that's why she didn't lose all of her sanity, like Chuck Steere.
536240	542560	Coming from when she had that scene with her daughter, it's always rough to see a child.
543280	546000	It pulls at her heart string a little bit more so.
546000	552160	And also in this way, uh, but also knowing what's going on in the world, having a sense
552160	557440	of the unnatural and the weird occult thinking it's coming for children.
557440	563520	I think she's only been exposed so far to adults having gone through these terrible things.
563520	567440	And so now, uh, faced with a child, it's unsettling to her.
567440	573920	But I think she taps into her professionality immediately and will try to assess the situation.
574720	578720	Notice that Carl is reacting the way he's reacting, so he did not know.
579280	585680	Um, and she will, yeah, she will slowly try to approach the corpse
585680	588240	and make a medical assessment of it.
588240	589120	Yeah, totally.
589120	594560	I think Doreen is kind of in the weird mix of just like going back and forth
594560	598640	between feeling like completely sick because it's a child and she's been
598640	601600	haunted by these little metal melting children.
601680	610080	But at the same time, there's like a weird wrong comfort because she is like an agent
610080	618880	and has dealt with like murder before this almost feels like routine routine to her.
618880	619520	I know.
619520	624240	But I think that's part of the reason why she lost less sanity.
624240	625440	Another day in the office.
625440	625600	Yeah.
625600	628160	She's like good at compartmentalizing.
628160	628560	Yeah.
628560	631440	So does she like spring to action type of person or?
631920	635840	She'd probably be the first one to move forward.
635840	636400	Yeah.
636400	639040	What would even like, what is her move?
640800	641440	Check this out.
641440	643360	I know that you're not an FBI agent.
644400	650160	And I know that we don't always know what the proper like move is.
650160	653840	You know, when you're playing someone who just has a completely different job in life
653840	655200	than we do, it's role playing.
655200	658000	But you know, what would be Doreen's next move?
658000	658800	There's a body.
659440	660880	Nobody touch it.
660880	662640	Trying to find evidence.
662640	668160	Rusty over here should take this moment to like analyze the body.
668160	668960	Maybe me too.
668960	669520	Sure.
669520	676000	And, and Dr. Miller, of course, surgeon, you guys have like a good team for, for analyzing
676000	677600	the situation for sure.
677600	681040	I think it's interesting because Doreen, I would imagine is normally trying to figure
681040	682160	out who killed the body.
682160	682640	Right.
682640	686720	But in this case, you know, you know, it's pretty obvious, you know.
686720	693120	But I think the question right now is how did this body get here when did it, is this
693120	696720	morphed from something else or like, did something put this here?
696720	697520	Totally.
697520	698240	Yeah.
698240	704240	Rusty, I think she's pretty almost in a twisted way, like finally paying attention.
704240	705760	Like she's interested now.
706800	710400	Like she's been a little preoccupied with her personal life.
710400	715200	She's pretty selfish and private and she's been pretty like annoyed by her fellow agent.
715200	716720	So she hasn't really been giving a shit.
716720	720240	And it's very one-to-one with Ali's experience so far in the game.
720240	722240	I was very annoyed by my fellow agents.
722240	723280	Didn't really give a shit.
724800	727760	But now that there's a dead body, I'm pretty stoked.
727760	733280	Well, and like, cause her experiences with the unnatural occurrences were like very impersonal
733280	736080	because she was so far removed from everything else.
736080	739520	So everyone else had a more like personal hands-on experience.
739520	744640	So now that she's seeing this body, she's like kind of finally like taking it seriously
744640	749840	and is actually like interested and she needs to be interested in something to do her job well.
751280	755360	Is she thinking like, I see my next Nobel prize.
756640	757440	Exactly.
757440	761440	I think like probably for everyone, the Delta green part of your brain
761440	764960	in the back of your brain is saying, where's the evidence?
765520	768160	How do we destroy it and make sure this doesn't get out?
768880	772400	And finally, there is a certain amount of evidence
772400	777840	that lives inside the brains of witnesses, right?
777840	780960	So you do know that Jerome Dyer is another Delta green agent.
780960	787280	It's fine if he knows, but there are two civilians in this room right now, Carl Lambert,
787280	794480	crying for Michael, who you remember to be the name of his younger brother who went missing
794480	799760	almost 30 years ago, but who is still a 12 year old corpse on this table right now.
801120	804080	And then you have Janice Ruth, who is also in this room.
804080	811600	So I'm going to cut to her real quick as she is going to make a beeline for the front door.
812720	813200	Hell no.
816720	817840	Am I real quick?
817840	819680	Am I pretty incapacitated?
819680	820320	Oh yeah.
820320	820720	Okay.
820720	821040	Yeah.
821040	821520	Sorry.
821520	824640	Ellie, you said Dr. Miller was going to be really interested in going up to the body,
824640	829600	but as soon as Janice Ruth starts making a move, you reacted immediately.
829600	831360	So let's go to you.
831360	833280	Do you step into her way or?
834000	839040	The thing is I want to, Ellie, but I don't know if my character would be,
839040	844960	have that sort of role in her behavior because she's unbelievably clumsy and
846080	847360	like my dex is not great.
848000	855360	So I feel like it would be one of those like situations where I'm like somebody stop her,
855360	859680	but I would try to motion for her if I can, like I can roll for it.
859680	860560	I mean, who knows?
860560	860960	I don't know.
860960	861760	Alertness.
861760	863040	Would that be a thing or?
863040	863280	Yeah.
863280	867840	Let's actually just have all three of you who've succeeded on your sanity checks.
867840	874960	If you could all roll alertness and actually Lindsey is Doreen's alertness or search higher.
874960	875840	I succeed.
875840	876480	Okay, great.
876480	877680	I got a little roll.
877680	878480	I got a 12.
878480	879360	Oh, nice.
879360	882560	I got a 97 on a 20.
882560	884800	My alertness is higher than my search.
884800	885760	And what did you roll?
886320	886960	Oh, I sorry.
886960	887680	I haven't rolled yet.
891200	894480	74 on a 70.
896560	896880	Okay.
896880	902480	So Ellie, I'm going to give you the option since you're the only one who succeeded.
902480	905920	Are you, uh, are you going to make a move toward the door to stop Janice Ruth before
905920	909040	she goes out or are you going to immediately check out the body?
909040	914080	Miller wants to check out the body, but she is the body, but she is a super, super, she's
914080	914800	cool right now.
914800	916080	She's cool headed, level headed.
916080	917680	So she knows exactly what's going on.
917680	919680	Her perception is on point.
919680	924560	So she just straight up goes to, uh, she catches Ruth by the arm.
926240	927520	Oh, there's no need.
927520	929120	There's no need to panic.
929120	931200	No, are you kidding me?
931200	931700	Panic?
933360	933860	Panicking.
936000	938960	You seem to have been through a lot.
938960	939920	This happens a lot.
939920	947280	And she is going to lie and she's going to try to convince Ruth that she is hallucinating.
947280	950320	She's been hallucinating, uh, had some sort of head trauma.
950320	954880	She's going to try to do like a medical, do the power of suggestion of like, how have
954880	955920	you been sleeping lately?
955920	958160	Have you had any head trauma?
958160	958720	All right.
958720	959840	Uh, do you have psychotherapy?
959840	960240	Yes.
960240	960800	Oh, awesome.
960800	962400	Go ahead and roll psychotherapy.
963200	964800	Uh, not super high.
965760	968240	41 for psychotherapy.
969840	971600	Where's my psychotherapy?
971600	973680	Where the fuck is my fucking psychotherapy?
973680	976720	Uh, no, um, I have nevermind.
976720	977840	Uh, no, I failed.
981040	982240	I know what it was.
982240	983120	I know what it was.
983120	984080	I know what it is.
984080	984580	No.
987120	988000	Calm down.
988000	988640	Calm down.
988640	991760	I just, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.
993120	994320	Um, I'm going to, yeah.
995120	996720	She's going to need to be restrained.
996720	996960	Yeah.
996960	997360	All right.
997360	1000160	So, uh, can I punch her in the face?
1000160	1000640	Jesus.
1001920	1004080	Can I just, can I try and restart?
1004080	1005280	I probably have.
1005280	1005520	Yeah.
1005520	1010400	I think at this point, if, uh, the other two who have succeeded on their sanity checks
1010400	1012160	want to, want to move in to help.
1012160	1012480	Yeah.
1012480	1015520	I think I probably have things to help restrain.
1015520	1018480	Medical doctor, do you have an inhaler in your bag?
1019120	1026320	I didn't take one out last week, but, uh, do I, Zach, please?
1026320	1026800	Always.
1027600	1030960	I, I like to think that everyone has everything.
1030960	1032480	Everyone's very well prepared.
1032480	1034000	You wouldn't be in Delta Green if you weren't.
1034000	1034400	Oh, what's this?
1034400	1036160	A million dollars in my pocket.
1039200	1039680	Okay.
1039680	1045280	I'm gonna shove the inhaler in her and try to shove a inhaler in her mouth.
1046000	1051680	So as Dr. Hooch and Doreen Marine kind of grab either side of this woman and set her
1051680	1056720	down onto the ground, still with the echo of cool, cool, cool, cool.
1056720	1058160	She's in the background.
1058160	1062160	Uh, Dr. Miller pulls out an inhaler, helps Janice Ruth with.
1062160	1071840	Uh, you look over and you see Jerome Dyer.
1071840	1074320	Agent Dyer is, uh, is comforting.
1075040	1080400	Carl Lambert, who is now on his knees, kind of crawled up toward the pool table.
1080400	1083920	He's got his elbows on the pool table and his hands flat.
1083920	1089200	Chin is on his hands and he's just crying and staring at the face.
1089520	1095680	You know, kind of from the side, uh, on this corpse of this, again, just completely bruised
1095680	1101600	every single part of the skin all the way down is blue and black and purple with bruising.
1101600	1107520	And there's just slug hole after slug hole with blood just pouring out and pooling on
1107520	1108400	this tarp below.
1108960	1116560	And Jerome Dyer is just comforting Carl as best he can as Carl is just weeping and moaning.
1116560	1117840	This was a separate room, right?
1118400	1123360	Basically the setup of this room is you walk in the front door on your right, there's a
1123360	1124160	bathroom.
1124160	1126480	There's not like a door to the bathroom.
1126480	1131200	There's just a stall door with a toilet in the stall with a sink next to it.
1131200	1133600	That's all still open in this room.
1134160	1141120	There's a skee-ball table right next to our skee-ball, you know, uh, not table machine,
1141120	1144160	machine, skee-ball machine right next to the toilet.
1144800	1150480	And, um, uh, and then, you know, uh, in the middle of the room is this pool table with
1150480	1155360	the tarp on it where this boy's body is laying lifeless in the corner of the room.
1155360	1163280	There's some couches and a TV, and then all hanging on the walls is equipment for both
1163280	1168080	Bigfoot hunting and for YouTube video making the two most important things in life.
1168720	1172960	And you also would notice that, uh, there's some like work desks and stuff where they've
1172960	1175280	got their, uh, computer set up.
1175280	1180720	Jerome Dyer's looking back at one of the computers and he pulls out his phone and looks at the
1180720	1183360	time and, and then, and that doesn't matter.
1183360	1186320	I was just, I just kept talking for some reason.
1186320	1191600	Okay, so, uh, just like, and then this happens, and then this happens.
1193200	1200720	Dr. Millie would, uh, tries to get the attention of, uh, Dr. Rusty Hooch or Dr. Falsom.
1201120	1206400	Pretend name is right now and be like, we should try to look at the body, but we need
1206400	1208960	to calm these two assholes down first.
1208960	1213200	Um, but she doesn't say that she tries to do it with her eyebrows.
1213200	1213700	Exactly.
1214400	1219440	Can I go out to the lab and cook something up to knock them out?
1219440	1221600	Oh yeah, absolutely.
1221600	1221920	Okay.
1221920	1228640	So I see Dr. Miller looking at me and I just kind of sneak out the back while you two are
1228640	1229840	holding her down.
1229840	1234880	As Dr. Miller can kind of go look at the body, Doreen is still with Janice Ruth and
1234880	1238560	Janice looks up at you and she's like, are you going to help?
1239440	1240240	What's happening?
1240240	1242400	Honey, I got my iPad out in the car.
1242400	1243360	Let me just go get it.
1243360	1244640	It'll calm you down.
1244640	1246240	It calms me down every night.
1246240	1247440	Oh no, no, I need you.
1247440	1248880	I need you right here.
1248880	1249440	All right.
1249440	1249940	Okay.
1250560	1251600	What do we do?
1251600	1254560	I pull out my personal cell phone and I pull up Pinterest.
1254560	1255060	Okay.
1255060	1259060	What do we do?
1259060	1260580	Just look at the pretty pictures, honey.
1260580	1261780	Just look at the pretty pictures.
1261780	1266980	This is literally like you're at the zoo, like on one side of the glass, like showing
1266980	1270180	the chimpanzee, like pictures of other chimpanzees.
1270180	1272100	And they're like telling you like, oh, nice.
1272100	1272340	Okay.
1272340	1273540	You can swipe to the next one.
1274100	1276820	I love that video, but this is Janice Ruth's version.
1276820	1278500	She's like, that's nice.
1278500	1279540	Let's go to the next one.
1280580	1281140	Oh, thank you.
1281140	1282020	That's a nice couch.
1282980	1283480	Oh God.
1284340	1286820	What is, is it like interior design porn?
1286820	1288980	I'm showing her videos of cooking.
1290020	1295220	I'm showing her like TikTok cooking videos and then like, and then interior design.
1295220	1299460	Those like tiny cooking videos where everything's super small and she's like,
1299460	1300500	everything's made of felt.
1300500	1303620	She's like, how did they make a spatula so small?
1305620	1308020	She like actually gets upset again because she doesn't understand.
1308660	1312180	While she's, while, uh, Janice Ruth is distracted.
1312180	1313620	Can I come back in with the shit?
1313620	1315220	But I need to approach Dr.
1315220	1316260	Miller first.
1316260	1322580	Rural pharmacy for what got, what got up, what you made for what happened in the lab.
1322580	1323940	55 on an 80.
1323940	1325460	That is a critical success.
1327300	1327700	Oh my gosh.
1327700	1329220	You're going to knock her out forever.
1334020	1334660	Oh my gosh.
1334660	1335620	You can fucking kill her.
1335620	1340500	Perfect because it's a critical success.
1340500	1344660	You can, uh, and because we made so many jokes about potions,
1344660	1348180	uh, you can give this if, I mean, if they'll take it right.
1348180	1352820	You have a liquid that is going to be clear.
1353380	1355780	It is going to be unscented.
1355780	1362580	It will have no taste and you cannot see it and they will only wake up when you, um,
1362660	1365780	is it the yin yang twins who said, snap your fingers?
1365780	1366280	Yeah.
1368340	1375140	Wait, can it be in a tiny, tiny cauldron and then maybe have some like smoke coming out of it?
1376820	1385940	Sometimes when you interject, it's useful all the time.
1385940	1391300	No, but it's as tiny as the tiny cooking videos, so she's intrigued.
1391380	1391540	Yeah.
1391540	1392980	She actually really likes it.
1392980	1394020	My God.
1395220	1395620	All right.
1395620	1402980	So I, um, I have this tiny, tiny culture in my hand, but I, I approached Dr.
1402980	1406500	Miller while Janice Ruth is being distracted with tiny cooking videos.
1408180	1412660	All right, listen, I've got something and I'm talking low so I can use my, my normal voice.
1413940	1415940	I'm not in character right now.
1415940	1418900	I've got something that'll knock these fuckers out, but as soon as I give it to him,
1418900	1420660	we're not going to be able to ask him a damn thing.
1420660	1421940	So do I need to wait a second?
1421940	1422740	What do I do?
1422740	1423460	That's a good point.
1424020	1428580	Like it, it seems like, um, our friend here has been able to calm her down somewhat.
1428580	1430180	Let's try to talk to them before.
1430180	1435140	And if they become aggravated again, let's use your little cauldron.
1435140	1436340	All right, we're going to need a word.
1437140	1437700	Banana.
1438340	1439700	But banana, got it.
1440260	1441540	That's my safety word.
1443060	1445940	You say banana, those fuckers knocked out immediately.
1446660	1447300	Exactly.
1447300	1447700	Perfect.
1447700	1448260	Thank you.
1448260	1448900	Thank you.
1448900	1449540	Good job.
1449540	1450500	Good thinking there.
1450500	1454580	She gives like a nod of approval to, uh, to Rusty.
1454580	1461300	And then I go and I hide my, I hide my, Rusty comes immediately.
1466580	1468340	Then I hide my tiny cauldrons.
1470020	1471380	Where do you hide it?
1471380	1472660	I put it in the corner.
1474900	1476980	Labeled tiny cauldron.
1477060	1482740	The Chuckster is coming out of his, uh, of his temp insane temp insane.
1482740	1484580	So it started out like really high.
1484580	1485620	Cool, cool, cool.
1485620	1491780	And as he comes back, it's like, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool,
1491780	1493300	cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
1494500	1495860	And then that's him just being normal.
1498740	1499060	Okay.
1499060	1500420	You're looking at this situation.
1500420	1506500	Currently we have Doreen Marine is showing Pinterest videos to Janice Ruth
1506500	1508340	and keeping her calm in the corner.
1508340	1512340	I'm picturing her in the corner, like up against the bathroom stall door.
1512340	1519380	It's literally the exact same shot of Doreen, like over someone and like a bathroom stall.
1519380	1523460	But this time she's helping as opposed to slamming a teenager into the toilet.
1524420	1531140	Dr. Rusty Hooch is carefully placing a tiny cauldron into the corner for safekeeping.
1531220	1537700	And, um, Dr. Olivia Miller is heading straight to the body to give it a thorough look over
1537700	1541380	as the Chuckster comes out of the situation and also sees
1541380	1549860	Carl Lambert staring at the body with agent Jerome Dyer kind of stroking his, um, lack of hair.
1549860	1553220	Can I roll a medicine to see, uh, what I see?
1553860	1555300	Yes, please roll.
1556260	1560900	Oh, well, 55 on a 60 actually.
1560900	1563380	Holy fucking shit, Ellie.
1564500	1565220	55.
1570500	1579300	So, um, because you critically succeeded mathematically, it just fucking happens all
1579300	1579780	the time.
1580740	1581220	Wait, it is.
1581700	1581940	Okay.
1581940	1584180	So it's, uh, one is a create zero.
1584180	1585860	One is the critical success.
1586500	1589540	Um, and then 100 is a critical fail.
1589540	1593780	So if you've got, that's 11 chances to critical out of a hundred.
1593780	1598020	So there's an 11% chance, but I feel like it's happening more than 11% of the time.
1599460	1600420	God is in this house.
1600420	1602500	No, it's still happening to me, but it's a crit fail.
1605700	1606020	Okay.
1606020	1613460	So with that being said, I am going to have Lindsay, Allie, Taylor, go ahead and take
1613460	1616420	off your headphones and get the fuck out of the living room.
1616420	1618500	So you can't hear me talk to Ellie right now.
1619940	1620440	What?
1621220	1623140	This is a game mechanic in the game.
1623140	1624020	That's so funny.
1624020	1627380	So Ellie, I like to run closed games.
1627380	1632980	So, uh, you know, obviously with all the introduction stuff, I think it's fun to let
1632980	1637780	everyone in on like the character full, like character idea of each person, even
1637780	1641300	though you meet as strangers and you wouldn't know all that information beforehand.
1641300	1646660	But once we get into the shit and someone learns a piece of valuable information that
1646660	1651140	the others wouldn't know, I think it's fun to just give that piece of information to
1651140	1653140	the person playing the character who knows it.
1653700	1654260	Okay.
1654260	1654900	Interesting.
1654900	1655220	All right.
1655220	1658740	So I can make a decision later whether I share it or not.
1659380	1660420	Yeah.
1660420	1665060	And this is kind of a pretty, uh, pivotal moment in the story.
1665060	1669060	So as Dr.
1669060	1675700	Olivia Miller checks out this body underneath all this bruising, all this black and blue
1675700	1686420	and purple bruising up near the chest of this boy, there seems to be a rash and it's in
1686420	1688100	the form of a circle.
1688660	1694740	You see the biggest circle first, and it probably goes over the shoulder, under the arm a little
1694740	1701540	bit around the pectoral muscle, over the clavicle, and then back around forming an enormous circle
1701540	1706900	over the, over the chest, kind of exactly where you would put your hand over your heart
1706900	1709460	to, uh, you know, swear an oath.
1710180	1713460	And then you notice a smaller circle just inside that bigger one.
1714420	1721380	And these are just these red rashes and they're thick lines as they get closer to the center.
1721380	1723620	And you see, it's like a bullseye.
1723620	1724660	It's like a target.
1725300	1729460	And in the very middle, you begin to look really closely.
1729460	1731540	You've got your gloves on, you're all suited up.
1731540	1739540	So you're able to kind of move the skin around and the skin is so wrinkly, like it's been
1739540	1744580	stretched out and now it's kind of sunken back in.
1744580	1747860	Like, oh, my doorbell rang.
1747860	1748500	That's odd.
1748500	1749220	Oh, perfect.
1750340	1751940	And, uh, I'm sorry.
1751940	1753300	I'm going to get that real quick.
1753300	1755060	This is the worst time to do this.
1759620	1760660	Sorry about that.
1760660	1765220	It's my good friend Joe's birthday, uh, in three days.
1765220	1766900	And that was his birthday present in the mail.
1767300	1767800	Yay.
1769300	1769800	Okay.
1770340	1772260	Back into the most intense thing we've done.
1772980	1773480	Yeah.
1774900	1777220	I'm like, I'm like, okay, so it's stretched out.
1777220	1777780	He's big.
1777780	1778180	Okay.
1778180	1786100	You notice as you kind of pinch at the center of this bullseye, there's a divot dug out
1786100	1794500	in the skin as if there was something, like if a golf ball were to land on the green,
1794980	1801540	uh, from a high place, then it would make a round spot in the grass.
1801540	1802820	Like a crater.
1802820	1803380	Yes.
1803380	1810500	Like a very, very small crater, just a, um, concave skin spot.
1811380	1816100	But because it's so wrinkly, it's almost like, um, it's almost like if you had an
1816100	1821140	uninflated balloon that you've taken scissors to just like an edge part of.
1821140	1826980	So there's just a little hole, like a little circle hole there in the skin.
1828020	1834820	And because you critically succeeded out of the corner of your eye, as you're pinching
1834820	1850340	the skin and noticing this little hole, you see something tiny black with countless legs.
1851700	1861860	Crawling on the ground of the dirty tile floor and this weird impromptu cabin barn thing.
1863860	1867460	And it looks to your eyes like a tick.
1868180	1869940	You've never seen a tick like this.
1869940	1876180	It has so many legs all around to where as it's moving, it just kind of looks like it's
1876180	1878020	floating right above the ground.
1878580	1879080	Ugh.
1879620	1880980	Go ahead and roll sanity.
1883140	1885700	31 on to my current 55.
1886260	1886740	Okay.
1886740	1889060	You're not going to lose any sanity.
1889060	1896020	You know, from your medical training and experience that a bull's eye rash is actually
1896020	1898740	a common occurrence in tick bites.
1898740	1899780	Tick bites.
1899780	1900740	Tick bites.
1900740	1901060	Yeah.
1901060	1903060	I've actually had a fair amount of ticks.
1903060	1904740	They're common in Sweden.
1904740	1905060	Yeah.
1905060	1909380	So, you know, it's always a bad sign when you get like, because you can get that several
1909380	1913060	weeks after they've stung you and then you have to.
1913060	1913540	Yeah.
1913540	1914100	All right.
1914100	1920580	Well, my theory, if we're now doing it secretly, and I had this theory last time when you
1920580	1927780	reveal the body and everyone's reaction is that it's somehow this boy is Bigfoot, right?
1927780	1931060	But he's morphing back like a werewolf or something.
1931060	1932020	That's my thing.
1932020	1932420	Right.
1932420	1932920	Yeah.
1933320	1939240	But, you know, much more awful way, but I didn't account for the tick.
1939240	1943320	So now I'm a little, I'm a little interested and curious, but I don't know.
1943320	1945240	So do I have to tell them or is it up to me?
1945240	1946360	You don't have to tell them.
1947000	1951400	You can just describe your actions however you would like, but I'm going to have basically
1951400	1956440	this will be your moment is your moment of knowledge is going to be your turn here.
1956440	1962680	And then as we, as we bring everyone back in, I'm actually going to move into combat
1962680	1966360	order and we're going to like, we're in combat rounds.
1967160	1967660	Okay.
1969720	1975720	Hello, please come back and record the rest of the day.
1978360	1981080	Zach, this is such a good, like, you're such a good GM.
1981080	1981400	Thank you.
1982280	1982760	Thank you.
1982760	1983480	Great.
1983480	1984120	So much fun.
1984120	1985320	What'd y'all talk about?
1985320	1985960	Welcome back.
1985960	1987800	We're moving into combat order.
1987800	1991960	I would like to know what your dexterity are because we're going to move from whoever
1991960	1996280	has the highest dexterity down to whoever has the lowest dexterity.
1996280	1998920	So do you want the score or the times five score?
1998920	1999560	Either one.
1999560	2001480	Cause I'll know the difference.
2001480	2002120	12.
2002120	2002600	Okay.
2003160	2003720	12.
2003720	2004760	Oh shit.
2004760	2005560	10.
2005560	2006440	Fine.
2006440	2006940	10.
2007480	2008120	Damn.
2008120	2008680	Okay.
2008680	2011720	So yeah, rock, scissors, paper.
2011720	2015160	This will be hilarious because Lindsay and Ellie have the delay.
2015160	2017080	So let's start with Ali and Taylor.
2017960	2018360	Okay.
2018360	2019320	Do you do shoot?
2019320	2020600	Shoot is for losers.
2020600	2021480	Rock, paper, shoot.
2021960	2022920	Rock, paper, shoot.
2024600	2024840	All right.
2024840	2025800	Ali goes first.
2026760	2028360	Uh, rock, paper, shoot.
2030040	2031320	This is going to be hilarious.
2032600	2034440	I'm just going to close my eyes and do it.
2035240	2035640	All right.
2035640	2036680	Rock, paper, scissors.
2037560	2038120	Open your eyes.
2039160	2039640	Oh, fuck.
2042920	2043480	All right.
2043480	2045640	So it is going to go Dr.
2045640	2049480	Rusty Hooch, then Chuck the Chuckster, then.
2049480	2053560	Actually, after that experience that I had, uh, where I lost my sanity,
2053560	2055640	I'm, I'm trying to be more serious.
2055640	2058040	So I'm like, call me, call me Charles.
2058040	2058280	Now
2062520	2069880	he says to God inside his own head, he's like, I really say that to yourself.
2069880	2071400	You're like, you get this together.
2071400	2072200	Chuckster.
2072200	2074360	No, get this together.
2074360	2075080	Charles.
2078040	2078600	Amazing.
2080360	2080360	
2081160	2085080	Charles, the serious, very serious boy.
2087720	2089000	We're going to start with Jerome.
2089720	2091560	Then we're going to do Dr.
2091560	2097160	Rusty Hooch, Charles, Charles, Charles.
2097160	2098440	You can call me Charles T's.
2098440	2100360	I'll call you just Charles.
2100360	2104200	Then, uh, then it will be Carl.
2104200	2106440	And then we'll have Doreen and Miller.
2106440	2107880	And then I don't know.
2107880	2109000	I'm just saying this out loud.
2109080	2110040	I'm going to cut it from the show.
2111960	2113720	Oh, so we can say weird stuff.
2113720	2116520	And I like poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop.
2116520	2117880	And now it's all staying in.
2117880	2119640	Janice Ruth is going to be last.
2119640	2122520	So, uh, okay.
2122520	2125800	So as far as you guys know, everything is the exact same.
2125800	2128600	When you look over, you can notice that Dr.
2128600	2133240	Miller is, uh, is pinching at the skin on the chest of this corpse.
2133240	2137800	She is wearing like a full hazmat suit and gloves at this point, as are
2138520	2139320	all four of you.
2139320	2143560	If you forgot about that and your mental image of the scene, throw it back in there.
2144280	2146760	And so we're going to have Dr.
2146760	2148680	Hooch kick this thing off.
2148680	2150280	As you also would see, Dr.
2150280	2157800	Miller is now releasing the skin and begins looking for, uh, something in her
2157800	2161080	pockets or bag that she has with her.
2161080	2161800	And it's Dr.
2161800	2162360	Hooch's turn.
2162360	2162680	Dr.
2162680	2164040	Hooch, what do you do?
2164040	2164280	Okay.
2164280	2167800	So I run over there because I'm supposed to be the doctor.
2168760	2170200	Aren't you a scientist?
2170200	2172200	Yeah, but, uh, and Folsom.
2172200	2173640	Oh, that's right.
2174680	2176920	We're still keeping up appearances at this point.
2176920	2177560	I forgot.
2177560	2181320	So I put my cauldron down and I quickly remember that I'm supposed to be the
2181320	2182520	doctor in the situation.
2182520	2183960	So I run over to Dr.
2183960	2190760	Miller, put my British accent back on and I loudly say, I loudly say this.
2194680	2195880	Right.
2195880	2197320	Let me take a look at the body.
2197320	2198360	Don't no one touch.
2198360	2199560	Move aside, move aside.
2201880	2204040	Which is perfect because she's already moving aside.
2204040	2205320	It is now Charles's turn.
2205320	2206920	I don't understand.
2207480	2209880	Is everything as I saw it last?
2209880	2210380	Yep.
2211000	2211400	Okay.
2211400	2215080	That's kind of the uncomfortable thing about moving into dexterity order in
2215080	2218200	Delta Green is sometimes you don't know why or why.
2218200	2222280	Cause a lot of times we'd be in moving in dexterity order when you're in combat
2222280	2224360	and then like a gunfight or a chase.
2225400	2229400	So this could be either one of those, but it also could just be me being like,
2229400	2233560	and now we're moving in dexterity order to make it seem like the tight
2233560	2234920	intention of the situation.
2234920	2235160	Okay.
2235160	2240440	I think that I'm going to use my two months of basic training knowledge.
2240440	2245640	I'm going to, I'm going to barrel roll over to the door and secure it.
2245640	2247800	I'm going to secure the place so that no one can escape.
2247800	2249720	Ocular pat down of the entire place.
2249720	2252760	You are at the only doors, the entrance and the exit.
2252760	2253560	Excellent move.
2254200	2257400	Jerome Dyer is still very much calming down Carl.
2258200	2262440	As Carl begins, let's see, actually, I'm going to go ahead and roll for Carl's
2262440	2263320	sanity here.
2265320	2270680	Carl's eyes begin to turn to anger.
2271320	2276920	And if anyone were to notice you, you, you're hearing Carl's sobs become more
2277000	2279720	just like, what the fuck?
2285960	2288520	Which I'm realizing now would be hard not to notice.
2288520	2292040	And Janice Ruth is, I'm just okay.
2292040	2293320	I'm just going to be okay.
2293320	2294600	I'm just going to be okay.
2294600	2297400	And I keep rolling really high sanity checks.
2297400	2299480	And so I'm going to lose my mind again a little bit.
2299480	2301560	And she looks up at Doreen.
2301560	2302680	She says, I'm fine now.
2303240	2307640	And she's going to try to stand up and, uh, and move toward the door that both.
2307640	2310760	Now Doreen is kind of in the way of, as well as Charles.
2311640	2312360	Is it my turn?
2312360	2312680	Yeah.
2312680	2317880	I think for Doreen specifically, she's just really ready to help with the body,
2317880	2324120	but I guess if she's fucking relegated, taking care of old lady on the ground.
2324120	2325240	She sure did.
2325800	2331960	I guess for this turn, I'm going to try and convince Janice to not leave the premises.
2331960	2332840	Yeah, great.
2332840	2337560	If you want to roll persuade or psychotherapy, which everyone's higher.
2342920	2345480	I rolled an 86 on a 50.
2346760	2349160	Damn, not lucky with the rolls.
2349160	2350840	At least it's not a crit fail.
2350840	2352040	At least it's not a crit fail.
2352600	2359160	Janice Ruth stands up and is going to move past you.
2359240	2363560	Now only has Charles between herself and the door.
2363560	2365400	Dr. Miller, it is your turn.
2365400	2372040	Dr. Miller sees that Janice is on her way to the door and she says with, uh, I'm going
2372040	2376680	to roll a persuade for this and she's going to say, if you leave, I have reasons to believe
2376680	2377880	that we're all going to die.
2377880	2379960	That is a strong persuade.
2379960	2386680	Uh, it's also weird and crazy, so I'm not going to get, I was, I was like, she deserves
2386680	2391400	a plus 20 on that until I thought about Janice Ruth in that situation, which is like, what
2391400	2393480	the fuck are you talking about, dude?
2393960	2402200	Uh, so go ahead and, uh, we'll just go straight up and down and roll that persuade.
2402760	2406120	Um, 15 on a 40 persuade.
2406120	2406760	Excellent.
2406760	2407320	Excellent.
2407880	2412280	Uh, she turns around, puts her hand behind her back.
2412920	2414440	Is that a threat?
2414440	2415320	It's not a threat.
2415320	2417320	It's a warning and it goes for all of you.
2417320	2422120	And she looks at the Carl who's crying and, um, and everyone in the room is just like,
2422120	2423000	nobody leaves.
2423560	2427720	I have reason to believe that there's something really wrong going on here.
2427720	2433000	When you look down, you notice that, uh, the floor is just white and tile and there's some
2433000	2436680	dirt spread around it, but you don't see anything else anymore.
2436680	2442200	Cause you've taken your eyes off the ground and, uh, we're going to head back to the top
2442200	2443160	of the order with Jerome.
2443160	2445400	Jerome's like, come on, Carl, it's going to be okay.
2445400	2446440	It's going to be okay.
2446440	2446840	All right.
2446840	2447560	Stay with me.
2447560	2448120	Stay with me.
2450360	2451560	Like a car that won't start.
2452760	2454600	And, uh, Charles, what are you doing?
2454600	2454920	Okay.
2454920	2459720	So I'm feeling very confident with your confidence.
2459720	2460040	Sorry.
2460040	2465080	Just to give you a quick rundown, Janice turned her back to you when she turned to talk to
2465080	2466040	Dr. Miller.
2466040	2470040	When she put her hand behind her back, you see that she's reaching for a gun that is
2470040	2472440	in her like waistband.
2472440	2472840	Okay.
2472840	2476200	And you are literally within arm's reach of both.
2476200	2479000	You can grab her hand, you can grab her wrist, you can grab her gun, you can punch your butt.
2480680	2481160	Well, okay.
2481160	2486280	I think I'll use my, I would like to talk and move at the same time and humans typically
2486280	2486680	do that.
2486680	2487720	You can definitely do that.
2487720	2487960	Okay.
2489400	2491240	You're like, what can I do?
2491240	2492200	What can I do in this game?
2492200	2493640	It's kind of two things at once.
2493640	2493880	Yeah.
2494520	2497480	Talking, talking is always like kind of a free action.
2497480	2497960	Freebie.
2497960	2498200	Yeah.
2498200	2498760	Okay.
2498760	2501560	So I am action wise.
2501560	2506040	I am using my athletics to reach for the gun.
2506040	2506360	Okay.
2506360	2509000	And also I'm going to do like a, I can picture this.
2509000	2514920	So she's turned around and I'm going to stick my leg between her legs and then wrap it around
2514920	2517000	one and get her down to a kneeling position.
2517720	2518280	Okay.
2518280	2519240	Yeah, that's rad.
2519240	2521560	Go ahead and roll athletics.
2521560	2526760	This is like a wrestling move or, um, I guess athletics.
2527720	2532600	I mean, if you want to give me something I have higher in like unarmed combat actually
2532600	2533720	is probably closer.
2533720	2534440	That's lower though.
2534440	2534680	Yeah.
2534680	2535160	Go ahead and roll.
2535880	2537480	I'm going to go ahead and roll athletics.
2539800	2540600	You know what?
2540600	2541240	I'm going to go.
2544920	2549480	I pass either one 39 on a 40 or on a 50 or a 60.
2549480	2549800	Whoa.
2552680	2553400	All right.
2553400	2554280	The jig is up.
2555240	2557080	What the fuck is going on here?
2557080	2559320	I turned to Jerome.
2560040	2561720	You got to fill us in, bro.
2561720	2563160	Like this shit's crazy.
2563160	2564360	Absolutely no idea.
2564360	2567720	This was a goddamn Bigfoot five minutes ago.
2567720	2570520	Well then how the fuck did it turn into a little boy?
2570520	2572040	I'm not a doctor.
2572040	2575080	And you both just like whip pan turn to the other two.
2576680	2581560	I think someone should look to see if there is security footage so we can see a transformation.
2581560	2582600	Did I skip Dr.
2582600	2583480	Hooch's turn?
2583480	2584040	Yes.
2585000	2586840	Allie, you didn't speak up at all.
2586840	2587560	I thought I went.
2587560	2589400	I was like, I guess I go after Taylor.
2589400	2592040	I guess I, I guess I lost rock, paper, scissors.
2593160	2595400	I forgot I won rock, paper, scissors.
2595400	2597800	I forgot to, you know, have you go next.
2597800	2598600	So it's your turn.
2599560	2599960	Okay.
2599960	2604680	So I, now that things are getting a little more out of hand with these two civilians,
2604680	2611320	I look directly at Doreen and then I glance over at the cauldron in the corner so that
2611320	2613160	she knows she needs to go get it.
2613160	2616040	And I'm still like hovering over the body playing Dr.
2616040	2616760	Anne Folsom.
2617480	2618360	I'm so sorry.
2618360	2621880	I, if you could hold, just everyone hold for a moment.
2622520	2625240	My Pro Tools is not responding and I'm having a heart attack.
2625240	2626200	Oh, you're doing great.
2626200	2628600	What do you use your Pro Tools for?
2628600	2629560	Recording.
2629560	2631800	Oh, that's bad.
2631800	2632300	Yeah.
2632680	2633180	Oh no.
2633720	2634360	Yep.
2634360	2635080	I just realized.
2635080	2637480	Hey guys, it's all still there.
2637480	2646680	It literally did full not responding white screen and then boom, back to fully in motion.
2650760	2651720	Can you imagine?
2651720	2652520	Oh my God.
2652520	2653000	Let's get this man a shot.
2653000	2657400	I had to rerecord an entire, two entire episodes once.
2658120	2658620	No.
2659880	2666440	That it was like, it was like a very cool finale, like all the revelations and it's
2666680	2668760	like gone.
2668760	2670920	That fucking sucks.
2670920	2671240	Yeah.
2671240	2674840	But it actually, the second time around was better because then they could rehearse.
2674840	2675960	Yeah, of course.
2675960	2676460	Yep.
2676840	2677080	Yeah.
2677080	2680840	We recorded, we rerecorded our first episode because it was the first time we were ever
2680840	2684200	on mic and we finished and we were like, that sucked.
2686920	2687640	All right.
2687640	2693800	Let's move on to, well, if I'm being honest, didn't hear a goddamn word you said Allie.
2693800	2698520	So I'm still doctor who just still hovering over the body playing and fall some playing
2698520	2703400	doctor, but she looks over her shoulder directly at Doreen and then looks over at the cauldron
2703400	2705560	to let Doreen know that she needs to go grab that.
2705560	2705800	Yes.
2705800	2707400	Go ahead and roll alertness for me.
2707400	2707900	Okay.
2709400	2709640	Damn.
2709640	2711480	Why'd you give me such a low alertness?
2711480	2711640	Yeah.
2711640	2712200	Sorry, dude.
2712760	2713320	Wait.
2713320	2713960	Holy shit.
2715400	2716520	Is that a great success?
2716520	2718200	No, 11 would be.
2718200	2720200	Oh, what does it mean?
2720200	2721560	It means you passed.
2721560	2722040	Oh, okay.
2722040	2722760	I pass.
2722760	2723400	Congrats.
2723400	2723960	Thank you.
2723960	2724680	Uh, okay.
2724680	2728440	Instead of leaving, instead of leaving the room this time, Lindsay and Taylor, just take
2728440	2729240	off your headphones.
2729800	2733240	And then if you just like put your fingers in your ears and wiggle them a little bit,
2734520	2735800	maybe don't make that noise.
2739160	2740040	Dr.
2740040	2740680	Hooch.
2740680	2741080	Yeah.
2741080	2750440	As you look at Doreen, Marine, you see that there is a small tick on the ground that is
2750440	2758440	crawling directly towards the military boots that are planted firmly on the ground in
2758440	2759480	between Doreen.
2760120	2762440	I don't know why I'm describing her feet so weird.
2763480	2764600	It's heading toward her boots.
2765640	2766520	It's a small tick.
2767320	2768680	I need you to roll sanity.
2769240	2769480	Okay.
2771080	2772360	It's just a bug.
2772360	2774440	You got 71 on a 55.
2774440	2776280	Oh, it's probably not just a bug.
2776280	2777720	You're going to lose one sanity.
2778600	2779480	You've seen ticks.
2780360	2784520	Ticks don't have that many legs, Dr.
2784520	2785320	Hooch.
2785320	2792920	This thing basically is floating as a wild amount of legs, but also seemingly a changing
2792920	2799160	amount of legs carries this thing as if it's floating just off the ground directly toward
2799160	2799800	Doreen Marine.
2799800	2805480	As you, as you, uh, point at her and then give her the eyes, you know, over to, over
2805480	2806840	to the vial.
2806840	2808280	Do I get another action?
2808600	2810120	Because you failed your sanity?
2810760	2813880	No, but you do see this thing.
2813880	2819000	And so the knowledge that you possess and making the move toward Marine of having her,
2819000	2820840	which is handy that you're telling her to move.
2822040	2822760	Yeah, I guess.
2822760	2824440	That does work out quite well for you.
2825320	2825960	Okay.
2825960	2826460	Okay.
2826920	2827420	Okay.
2828360	2829320	Understood.
2829320	2830760	Hey, did you fucking get me?
2830760	2831400	All right.
2831400	2831640	Yeah.
2831640	2835320	So I motion to Doreen Marine to go over to the cauldron in the corner.
2835320	2838520	The cauldron to get the, uh, the sleepy time medicine.
2838520	2839720	Banana time.
2839720	2842440	It's fucking banana time.
2843240	2850840	Uh, and with that, I need everyone else to roll sanity.
2850840	2854680	So Charles, Doreen, Dr.
2854680	2856040	Miller, go ahead and roll.
2856840	2857480	Alertness.
2857480	2857980	Sorry.
2858440	2859880	Did I say alertness or sanity?
2859880	2860440	You said sanity.
2860440	2861320	Oh, alertness.
2861320	2862120	Roll alertness.
2862120	2863320	Thank God.
2863320	2868200	Because if it was sanity, I would have crit failed, but I crit success.
2870760	2871880	44.
2871880	2872840	Congratulations.
2872840	2874840	Yeah, that was a real turnaround.
2874840	2875240	Lindsay.
2875800	2878680	51 on a 70.
2878680	2879880	Oh, success.
2879880	2880680	And Dr.
2880680	2883560	Miller fail 34 on a 20.
2883560	2883800	Dr.
2883800	2889800	Miller seems to be looking all around on the floor, trying to find something that she may
2889800	2893160	have seen previously, but is now lost Doreen.
2893160	2898040	You see it right in front of your boots on the ground, crawling toward you.
2898040	2904120	And Charles, you also see this little, little creature.
2904120	2908600	Um, no, go ahead and roll a sanity, both Charles and Doreen.
2908600	2909960	Why is sanity so low?
2912760	2915320	Yeah, I failed 4259.
2915320	2916600	Oh, that's a success.
2916600	2918680	So, uh, you have so much sanity.
2920760	2923080	I only lost one earlier when you lost like five.
2923080	2923320	Okay.
2923320	2923640	Sorry.
2923640	2925080	Lindsay, take off your headphones again.
2925080	2926440	As you just, oh wait, no, hold on.
2926440	2926920	Sorry.
2926920	2928200	Keep them on just for a moment.
2928200	2928680	Listen to me.
2928680	2930200	Listen to the words coming out of my mouth.
2930200	2931320	You see just a tick.
2931320	2932840	There's just a tick on the ground.
2932840	2933480	It's normal.
2933480	2934200	You're out in the woods.
2934200	2934840	There's a tick.
2934840	2936360	There's, you know, sometimes there's crickets.
2936360	2937400	Sometimes there's ants.
2938200	2939800	No, it's just like a normal tick.
2939800	2941240	I mean, ticks are not great.
2941240	2944440	You don't want it to be near your foot, I suppose, but that's all you see.
2944440	2945400	You take off your headphones.
2945400	2945960	No big deal.
2945960	2952520	Hey, uh, Chuckster, this thing has so many goddamn legs.
2952520	2954840	Uh, like this is not a tick.
2954840	2960280	This is, it looks like a tick, but it's almost like floating off the ground with how many
2960280	2963000	legs it has and the number of legs keeps changing.
2963000	2967400	And like with the critical success on the alertness, you actually notice that it is
2967400	2974200	almost like forming and reforming in different spots around like as it's moving toward Terrain's
2974200	2974760	boot.
2974760	2975800	I can picture that.
2975960	2976840	Yeah, me too.
2979400	2980360	Good storytelling.
2980360	2981560	Oh, hey, thanks dude.
2984280	2985080	I love you.
2985080	2985800	Love you too.
2985800	2987000	Shut up.
2987000	2988920	Get a room.
2991960	2993320	I'm so jealous of Lindsay.
2993320	2994440	She gets to close her ears.
2997800	2999480	Lindsay, they're saying bad things about you.
2999480	3000520	And Lindsay's back.
3003480	3004760	I messed up on the fun.
3004760	3006600	You have no idea how lucky you are.
3006600	3007560	Doreen, it's your turn.
3007560	3008040	What do you do?
3008040	3009240	I'm going for the cauldron.
3009240	3011000	Hey Zach, do I have to lose sanity points?
3011000	3012280	Yeah, just lose one.
3012280	3012780	Okay.
3013400	3014200	Thanks for asking.
3015000	3015960	You did have homework.
3015960	3017240	The rest of the class groans.
3020440	3021880	Roll dexterity.
3023640	3024140	Okay.
3028760	3029260	God.
3030440	3032040	Zero on.
3033240	3034600	I'm sorry, you rolled zero?
3034600	3037640	I rolled double zero.
3037640	3038140	Hey guys.
3040760	3043720	All right, so double zero means 100.
3047240	3051400	100 is literally the worst thing you can roll in this game.
3051960	3053400	And Zach, what did you roll?
3053400	3057720	And this was a contest and I rolled a 38.
3057720	3058760	You rolled a 100.
3060680	3062280	So yeah, pretty easy.
3062280	3065080	You move over to the cauldron in the corner.
3065080	3065560	What do you do?
3065560	3066520	Do I know what this is for?
3066520	3071560	Do I know that this cauldron is like a potion that you've made that will knock them out?
3071560	3076360	I mean, all I've done is go out, bring it in, and then look at you and look at it.
3076360	3078200	So I grab it and I look at you.
3078200	3081640	I just glance over at Janice Ruth.
3081640	3085560	At this time, real quick, Ellie, if you could take off your headphones as well.
3086360	3090040	Lindsay and Ally, take off your headphones and plug your ears.
3090600	3091320	Me, it's me.
3092280	3094600	Hey Taylor.
3094600	3095640	Yeah, what's up?
3095640	3096440	What's up, bro?
3096440	3097560	You're my favorite.
3097560	3098920	I love you so much.
3098920	3101080	Should we pause like every five minutes to do this?
3101080	3102200	Yeah, it's really fun.
3102200	3103400	All right, should we get them back?
3105080	3105880	Are you serious?
3107560	3114200	Because you critically succeeded on your alertness check to see this weird fucking seemingly
3114200	3116920	unnatural otherworldly bug.
3117880	3123800	You also notice it, you know how I described how it like kind of blips in and out?
3124920	3133560	It seems to blip a couple times as it jumps and it slides directly down into the military
3133560	3140360	boots of one Doreen Marine and disappears into her boot.
3140360	3146840	You process that information finally when she's across the room and has grabbed this
3147720	3152680	cauldron, you finally think to yourself like, holy shit, that thing just like disappeared
3152680	3153560	into her boot.
3153560	3154680	That's so weird.
3154680	3157080	And am I allowed to do anything or just know it?
3157080	3159640	You just have to know that for now.
3159640	3160520	I can't yell out?
3161800	3163480	Let her act first if that's cool.
3164360	3165880	We don't want to interrupt her.
3165880	3167480	She seems to have something fun to do.
3168200	3169400	I think she's excited about it.
3169400	3169880	What do you think?
3172600	3173720	All right, let's get it back.
3173720	3174680	All right, come back.
3174680	3175320	All right.
3175320	3179000	Hold on, I have to wipe the earwax off my fingers onto my pants.
3180440	3181880	Everyone stop what you're doing.
3186440	3189720	This is the most grossed out I've ever been recording the show.
3190520	3193000	And he records with Luke and Thomas.
3193000	3194280	I'm so honored.
3195960	3197240	No mention of Joe there.
3197240	3198120	That's interesting.
3200120	3200760	Joe's a saint.
3205720	3206680	Yeah, no, no big deal.
3211400	3212520	Doreen Marine, what do you do?
3213160	3219640	I made eyes with Rusty Hooch, who just looks at Janice, right?
3219640	3221160	I'm going to head towards Janice.
3221160	3227720	And I think my plan is to just like try and like, as if she were my cat or my dog, just
3227720	3231720	like pry her mouth open and give her some of this and like rubber throat to get her
3231720	3232360	to swallow.
3235960	3237240	As you're doing that.
3237240	3240440	Doreen, pour it in your boot.
3243320	3245800	So I poured in my boot, not all of it.
3247320	3248600	Whoa, what the fuck?
3248600	3249640	So trusting.
3249640	3251160	Wow, so trusting.
3251160	3252440	That's amazing.
3252440	3254280	He seems pretty sure of himself.
3254280	3258440	And also like, and once I became Charles, everyone just was like, wow, there's just
3258440	3259320	something about him.
3259320	3260600	I just trust him.
3260600	3262840	He pulled that move where he got the gun.
3262840	3265640	Charles in charge of our taste.
3271480	3272840	Now recording.
3272840	3274200	Now recording.
3274200	3275800	You are now being recorded.
3280920	3282760	That's how I'm going to laugh for this episode.
3282760	3284120	If you guys are cool with that.
3285480	3286600	Only if I can laugh like.
3288600	3291080	That's a satisfying mic sound.
3291480	3293640	That was dick-sucking sound.
3296360	3297480	Satisfying.
3297480	3297880	All right.
3351080	3368920	Let's go.
3381080	3397080	Falling fast into a deep abyss
3397080	3401080	Till they chase you out again
3401080	3407080	Find your feet on your broken bones
3407080	3417080	Clear out the edge again
3437080	3457080	Falling fast into a deep abyss
3457080	3477080	Falling fast into a deep abyss
3477080	3497080	Falling fast into a deep abyss
3497080	3517080	Falling fast into a deep abyss
3517080	3537080	Falling fast into a deep abyss
3537080	3561080	Falling fast into a deep abyss
3561080	3581080	Falling fast into a deep abyss
3581080	3601080	Falling fast into a deep abyss
3601080	3629080	Falling fast into a deep abyss
3629080	3653080	Falling fast into a deep abyss
