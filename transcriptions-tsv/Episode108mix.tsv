0	13280	Hey y'all, it's Zach. Sorry for not being wolf, he'll be on momentarily, but first I have a quick announcement and a request, a plea, I'm begging, it's a bag.
13280	22640	The announcement, you may have noticed we released a trailer for this first season of pretending to be people here on our RSS feed.
22800	31120	We've also uploaded said trailer to YouTube, yeah! I'm so abso-fucking-lutely stoked.
31760	37680	This has been on my to-do list for two years now and crossing it off,
39840	49120	I won't go into detail, but it feels good. I have poured everything I am into this show and I'm
49120	55600	immensely proud of the result. And the fact that my best friends and I have been able to stay close
55600	65440	and create this story together, it's really meaningful. Shit, okay, on to the request, the plea,
65440	73360	the bag. Please, please, you've listened to so many hours of this campaign and like
73360	82080	three and a half years of our bullshitting banter, so I beg you, please share our trailer
82080	90080	for pretending to be people season one everywhere. Reddit, Discord, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook,
90080	99840	fuck Mark Zuckerberg, everywhere. It would make me feel good. And as Wolf says, the link
100400	107760	is in the show notes. Seriously, thank you all so much for listening. We have horribly delightful
107760	115200	things in store for you after season one, so hold on to your horses by their sick BDSM gear
115200	123280	and get ready. Now over to you, Wolf. I have a question for y'all, my adoring fans. Do you
123360	131840	prefer your bread to be moist or unmoist? Before I answer, you should comment down below what y'all
131840	139360	prefer. And don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe. And before I answer, this question
139360	146560	was brought to you by Wet Bread Incorporated. They make bread wetter. So anyway, I, of course,
146560	153120	like my bread moist and sloppy. You throw a couple of slices of that good year old bread
153120	160000	into a bucket of room temp milk, let it sit for a month to 10, and you got a damn stew going.
160000	170640	And oh yeah, this is live from 694.2 PTBP, the only channel that offers you at least a baker's
170640	178240	dozen of new songs every week. This Howlin' with Wolf is from Brendan, who lives in San Diego.
178240	183840	They tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod. Just one of the many ways
183840	189760	you can help to make sure your favorite wolf's trash stays good and wet. They write,
190320	197200	Wolf, it's me. I was able to use the gun again, and I think this is the right time stream.
197200	203040	Things are really messed up. We have to make sure we keep those myriad monsters from stopping the
203040	209040	contention boys from fulfilling their destiny. Remember to keep checking the trash for the
209040	218480	updates from the head office. Your friend, Dog the Wolf. Head office? Head office? You think there
218480	225520	are powers that are above my own in this world, Dog the Wolf? Dog the Wolf, if that even is your
225520	232160	real name, what a stupid piece of shit name you have that no one would ever take seriously.
232160	237520	If you write this show again, I'm gonna find you, Dog the Wolf. And when I do,
239280	246000	well, I'd probably give you a big ol' hug. But then I'll banish you back to your own time from
246000	252320	whence you came. And remember, I don't make the rules, except for when I decide to. If you want
252320	259360	to write up something for your sourdough damsel, Wolf to Hal, tag at PretendingPod on the dadgum
259360	267040	internet, or write up a five star review on Apple Podcasts. And let my producer know you did so by
267040	274240	dropping an email to pretendingpod at gmail.com. Fuck Mark Zuckerberg. Follow at PretendingPod
274240	279520	on Instagram though. Fuck Jack Dorsey. Make sure you follow at PretendingPod on Twitter.
279520	285680	And fuck Jack Conte. Subscribe to Pretending to Be People on Patreon. Discord sick though,
285680	293520	no doubt. Follow along with our little community over there. All the links? Guess where they are.
293520	302400	Hyrule? No, you fucking nerd. The links are in the damn show notes. I am the segue, and the truth,
302400	312480	and the life. No one cometh unto the news but by me. Last time Rose Mary performed its predictable,
312480	319040	prepared, profusive prose. Though the production proved powerless due to a pitiful pun,
319040	325760	John stood his well-lit ground, shed the skin of his father, and began to alter the stage for what
325760	333360	is sure to be a main event level brawl. Don, Keith, and Clark ran for the shiny black building.
333360	341600	They were met by a chanting chorus, a singing swarm, a reciting circle, a luminous land liturgy,
341600	347360	a crooning crowd that consisted of close to all the characters that have been in this show so far.
348080	355680	Except for me. But like, I am here. I'm not looking around. I'm, uh, fuck. This new world's
355680	362240	got me feeling like a child called David after he visits the first Randy Angst. Is this going to be
362240	370400	forever? If so, that's fine. I've got Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Living In?
377440	387440	On top of the water, Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline, leaving my mind at your altar,
388960	398400	crossing the double line, doing it every time. Tell me what kind of world are you living in?
398400	405440	What kind of world are you living in?
411920	422320	Farts and Buttons. This 10-story tall creature with Rose M-A-R-Y atop it begins to trudge forward.
422880	431360	You see little technicolor beams from in front of you as you're running toward this building begin
431360	442160	to, as people start appearing on this luminous land all around you. As they hit the ground,
442160	447600	they're confused about what's happening. They're looking around. You see they're feeling their skin
447600	455040	like they were just recently covered in ooze. And now they're here. And you see with each
455040	463840	new person that arrives in this place, the beast grows even larger. You're running away,
463840	469120	but as you turn back and look over your shoulder to see, I mean, this thing is growing and growing
470080	473200	and Rosemary is just cackling into the sky.
479600	487520	And with one arm, this beast swipes at Silas Cole, picks him up off the ground,
487520	494640	and as Silas Cole is devoured by this fist, he is no longer visible.
494640	499120	Black and red light starts coming out from the hole that Jon has made in the ground.
500160	504480	And the air around you sounds angry. Keith Vigna, your counterpart,
504480	510800	you sent him to his seeming demise. It's your turn.
513040	515280	I'll just keep running. Clark.
515280	519760	I want to say real fast that we started doing some goof-em-ups, but when you were describing
519760	526000	seeing the town, I was getting nostalgia waves of joy with each person. When you said Gary
526000	532400	Daly was dressed to the nines, I was like, oh, Gary. That was really cool. That was really cool
532400	539840	to see all of our old friends. Now you get to die alongside them.
539840	546720	Clark is hearing that chant. Is that ringing a bell for him? Joe's, I guess, asking, is this
546720	552880	the chant that he had heard back when he was here previously? Yes. As this thing reverberates in
552880	560640	your head, you kind of think back to the moment you were in the circle of knowledge. Chief Maggie
560640	567520	Cook places this thing, this little bug-like creature with round circular mouths on the
567520	575360	bottom of your left foot, and you're sent to this place where these 12 figures are chanting up to
575360	580400	this beast. This beast that now in your memory looks tiny compared to this thing that you're
580400	587120	running away from, but at the time brought you to your fucking knees. And as you were weeping,
587760	597440	you just heard, Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ya of all the overseers. Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ya of all the overseers.
597440	603760	Clark is kind of with Reckless Abandon going to run toward that group, and he's singing along.
603840	608000	I don't know if he can find a way to get into the circle, but he wants to, he's like,
608000	614640	Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ya of all the overseers. Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ya. And I'm kind of emotioning
614640	620880	to the guys around me like, come on, come on. As you begin chanting this,
622560	632560	a light beams straight up into the dark sky from the middle of this circle, and a figure begins
632560	639280	rising with both of its hands out from the middle of this inner and outer circle that are going
639280	647840	in counter and normally clockwise directions. And you see a light emitting up into the air
647840	657600	from this humanoid's face. It is wearing dark robes, and it removes the hood above its head,
658240	670560	and there's a cowboy hat. Like a no-shit, like John Wayne-style cowboy hat on top of Clark Bishop
670560	678240	with black robes about 10 feet off the ground in the middle of this. And you, with your immense
678240	689040	power, chanting this same chant has given the overseer an overwhelming dose of unnatural power.
690720	699280	Yes, dude. Sha-ka-tee-fa-leet-ya. Clark has a lot more gusto in his chant as he sees this happening
699280	709120	before him. He is groovin' to it. Don, as you've gotten closer to this towering building,
710080	717120	this building that once looked huge, but again, with the perspective you have in this world now
717120	721360	with this creature behind you, this building doesn't look so tall, maybe three stories,
721360	727040	four stories. You hear the phone ring, and it's ringing from the top floor of this building. You
727040	732640	know it to be true in your Pettymore heart. You always trust a Pettymore heart. Just shut up,
732640	739920	Zach. Don't squint at me and frown. No, yeah. Donnie Pettymore's gonna run. I don't know.
739920	743520	Does the building have doors even? Like, I don't know. Is it like an unnatural? Yeah,
743520	747840	you kind of run past this huge group that's chanting, not giving a fuck about the thing
747840	752800	that is tugging at the heartstrings emotionally of the other three PCs in this situation,
753600	759440	and you can head right into the door of this thing. Yeah, I'll kind of push my way through
759440	766720	the crowd if they're in the way. Yeah, love it. Even rudely so, just knocking someone over.
767600	771680	I gotta get to that damn phone. You make it all the way up the stairs. You just fucking
771680	777840	sprint through these people into this building, up the stairs to the top floor. You see a small room.
777840	783840	There's a table made out of this inky black substance that the entire building is made out
783840	789360	of. There's a candle that is lighting this room that's sitting on top of this table,
789360	796000	and the candle is giving off the only light in this room, and it is illuminating two objects
796000	803760	sitting beside it on this desk. One on one side of the candle. There is an old-timey radio with
803760	809840	strange glass tubes, one of the glass tubes of which is broken, and neither the red nor the
809840	816400	green light are lit. On the other side of the candle, there's an old rotary phone.
818800	830960	Jon. Like a bad 3D animation, the ground where Jon was is just sinking and sinking deeper and
830960	838480	deeper, and this red and white light is coming out of it, this angry light, now that you've seen
838480	845920	Silas be destroyed. And all you see this turn is that it suddenly goes out. And in its place,
846480	856240	a technicolor swirl begins to appear. This spinning mass of people who are treating
856240	862000	the overseer like the top of a mayday pole as they weave in and out of each other. Now,
862000	866000	you've got the inner circle going one way, the outer circle going the other way, and before they
866000	871440	were purely inner and outer, but now they're weaving in and out of each other, passing left,
871440	877760	right, left, right, like a do-si-do, but never quite connecting arms in order to spin around
877760	884320	in a small circle before carrying on with a new partner. And they head toward this foe.
885120	891840	The monster? Yeah, sorry. This gargantuan behemoth. Big baddie.
891840	898400	Dripping with shadow. The big bad evil guy, if you will. As these dancing, singing, chanting
898400	907680	people from all across space and time and this specific campaign move toward this enormous
907680	915680	creature, it had just swiped down and grabbed consumed Silas Cole with one of its hands,
915680	927120	and the other arm swings across and takes out about half of this mass of people as it swipes
927120	933280	through backhanded like the second swing in a petty more slap. An uncle slap. Ouchie ouchie,
933280	950000	they all say. I felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried
950000	959760	out ouchie ouchie and then were silenced. And with that half of the luminous land liturgy,
959760	968960	this group of two intertwining circles chanting has just been consumed by the arm of the Gigantum
968960	981360	Repithecus in one swing. So let's play a game. This game could be fun. This game could also
982000	988400	be not super fun, depending. Are you going to force us to gamble the lives of the contention
988400	1003600	for townsfolk? You're evil. This is sadistic. You're an evil, evil man. The dice tell the
1003600	1010720	story. The dice tell the story. And since I can't trust any of you, I'm going to need your cameras,
1010720	1016800	like Thomas is doing now, to show me the dice rolls that you will be making. I'm going to
1016800	1027840	assign each of you a group of NPCs, or former PCs, and you will roll, if you roll under 50,
1030880	1034240	that NPC survives.
1039760	1045760	I wasn't looking, what did Joe do? None of anyone's business. He was rolling his dice.
1047440	1055760	Down by his wiener. Showing us his dice. This is a very serious moment.
1065200	1072240	If you roll under 50, the NPC that you were rolling for in that moment survives the attack.
1073040	1081200	If you roll 50 or over, they are consumed. We're going to start with Justin.
1085840	1093120	Justin, show me this roll. We'll roll individually for most NPCs, but for the first three,
1093120	1098880	we're going to put them in a chunk. They're all right next to each other. We've got the Old West
1098960	1104080	folks, not the PCs that you guys played, but we've got the bartender, the piano player,
1104080	1110480	and a gambler named Thomas. Kill them. They all have friend branded across their foreheads,
1110480	1116160	and they have a raccoon, a chunky kitty, and a handsome dog. You better not kill them.
1117440	1126080	Justin, don't kill these people. So roll for their life. Like RuPaul says, roll for your life.
1126160	1131120	Under 50, survive. Over 50, survive, but a little worse for wear.
1135600	1137200	Are you sure? That's my vote.
1140560	1145760	Well, rolled off camera. Well, I don't know where to put it. It's too tiny. There's a two.
1146800	1149360	Wait. Okay. Show us the important one.
1150240	1157200	Yeah. 32. So good. You got that roll out of the way. Now roll for Jack Pearlman.
1158880	1162320	Why did you make me do the good one first? That's right.
1162320	1166560	There's no way this is going to land on camera, but we can pull that camera a little bit further
1166560	1175200	away. That way I can watch your fucking hands. I got a 40. Yay. I'll show you.
1176160	1180080	Right on. And with that, Jack Pearlman,
1180080	1187520	the bartender, piano player, and gambler named Thomas, all from our old west of contention
1187520	1189280	have survived. Yay.
1189280	1191360	Next, we're moving on to Joe. Boo.
1196320	1199200	Listen as if you didn't know Joe and Justin are feuding this week.
1199200	1205440	No, Justin knows that I've been rolling really bad lately. So
1206080	1208880	everybody he throws up is about to get swatted right now.
1209680	1214320	Well, we're starting off with a pretty, pretty easy one. No one will care if they disappear.
1214320	1221120	It's Drew Andrews' body. Councilman Terry pages is likely inside.
1221120	1224000	His corporeal form, but not as like soul or memories.
1224640	1229280	And the excitable black lab, Tyler. Tyler.
1233600	1235120	It's an eight. Yay.
1235920	1236880	Well done. Well done.
1239680	1246000	All right. Next up, Harry clinker with an old distinguished proud.
1249760	1251120	Don't kill clinker.
1254640	1259600	What's it going to be? That boy's dead. It's a 62.
1263040	1265440	Damn. Oh no.
1265440	1266480	God damn.
1266480	1274800	Harry clinker stops chanting at the moment that this behemoth's arm is swiping across toward him.
1274800	1282160	His eyes get big. He looks down at this old distinguished gray dog,
1282240	1288640	pulls out a slice of white bread with some cut up hot dogs on it and feeds it to the dog.
1289680	1293360	Oh yeah. That's right. That's right. Good job. You're done. Good boy.
1294240	1296640	As they both get fully consumed.
1297840	1301120	Next up, I'm going to roll for old Everett Pace.
1301120	1301920	Okay. Oh shit.
1304080	1304720	Joe Terry.
1307440	1309440	Everett survives. It's a 45.
1312720	1314880	I'm so glad to stay around.
1314880	1315680	Good job, Joe.
1315680	1318640	Jack Pearlman fires a gun off in celebration.
1321600	1325280	Luke, your turn. We've got two people for you to roll for.
1325280	1334240	First is going to be Mildred Mitchell, rainbow earrings, her face completely bruised and swollen
1334240	1340800	from her last encounter with the contention PD and on her shoulder is an old gray squirrel.
1343120	1343840	22.
1345680	1348560	They survive little squirrelly.
1348560	1355120	And next is Gary Daley with the golden retriever named Bean.
1358160	1360240	He's putting your own dog in it.
1360800	1362160	That's so sad.
1363040	1364080	And it's a seven.
1366640	1367760	Thank God.
1367760	1368320	There you go.
1373120	1373600	Whew.
1374960	1375520	All right.
1376080	1378160	Bean lives to see another day.
1378160	1383440	This is going so, so much better than I expected.
1383440	1385440	Whew. My heart was racing for Bean.
1385440	1391920	Thomas, first up, your uncle, Jimmy Sanders with a possum.
1391920	1392240	Okay.
1392240	1393840	Yeah. Roll whatever.
1393840	1398320	Yeah. Thomas was like, this one can go over 50. That's fine.
1398320	1398560	Yeah.
1399200	1403280	Rolling in a terracotta pot.
1403280	1404880	He rolls 53.
1404880	1405360	Over.
1408240	1409680	Who's going to make our sandwiches?
1410320	1412160	The possum was named Common.
1412160	1417760	He was a NPC from Contention Critter Coalition, one shot.
1417760	1424480	Okay. But an NPC, not a PC and not a dog or a cat.
1424480	1425520	Just a possum.
1425520	1430560	Some people love possums and keep them as pets.
1430560	1432000	Fun fact today for you.
1432000	1437520	The John Ball shrieks in white hot rage like, I will avenge you, Jimmy.
1438160	1442800	Jimmy completely hears and understands that as he's fully fucking insane.
1442800	1450160	His eyes have been just as dilated as they ever were on any of his many shrooms trips
1450960	1452480	while he's been in this world.
1452480	1455200	And he's honestly been having a pretty good time.
1455200	1462400	So as he's consumed by this endless darkness within the arm of this gigantic creature,
1463200	1467680	he takes the possum, he takes the possum by the front two legs,
1467680	1472080	stares into its eyes and says, down to the next one.
1475520	1477920	That fucking rules. That's how I want to go.
1477920	1480000	Never go to a second location with a possum.
1482320	1483920	They're probably just playing dead.
1484000	1484500	Yeah.
1485120	1490080	Professor Horace Green holding the decapitated head of preacher Sheriff Dr.
1490080	1491920	Bobby Custard is up next.
1494800	1496320	I love this character so much.
1496320	1497040	Please don't die.
1497600	1498880	Fuuuuuuuuck.
1498880	1499680	That's a death.
1499680	1500320	What is it?
1500320	1501120	81.
1501120	1502240	Oh, that's too much.
1505920	1507920	I don't remember what that character voice was.
1507920	1509360	So that's personally...
1509360	1511120	Professor Horace Green?
1512320	1513600	Oh, I just like this.
1513840	1517920	I just meant like I'm glad I wouldn't have to be playing him since he's dead.
1517920	1518400	Oh, okay.
1518400	1518640	Yeah.
1518640	1519040	Perfect.
1519040	1519600	Good timing.
1519600	1521760	Now, can you play him real quick as he dies?
1522640	1525760	Now, play him at his most important moment.
1528080	1531680	Of all the wonders I've stared at in the natural world.
1531680	1536400	He says as the gigantron propithecus is swinging its arm towards him.
1536400	1539680	I never thought I'd imagine I'd see anything so beautiful.
1539760	1543920	And a smile crosses his face as he's subsumed into the creature.
1544800	1545520	Love it.
1545520	1546160	Love it.
1546160	1548560	Now, the last one.
1550080	1551840	Carrie Page's body.
1554000	1554480	Oh, no.
1555360	1558800	Drew Andrews inside with Salem the cat's body.
1559920	1560720	Oh, God.
1560720	1562000	Agent Trent Chad.
1562000	1564160	I hope God loves me enough for this role.
1565520	1568080	Everyone, if you could bow your heads.
1568080	1568880	Have you done your apples today?
1568880	1570640	I'd like to say a quick prayer.
1575680	1576080	Yes.
1576640	1579120	Drew lives and so does his corporeal form.
1579120	1580000	Hell, yes.
1580000	1580880	Thank God.
1580880	1582080	We got both Drew's.
1583040	1583360	Yeah.
1584000	1589680	Guys, this is literally, this is like fucking Thanos snapped and only Hawkeye disappeared.
1593040	1594800	I don't really understand that reference.
1594800	1605280	The song decibel level is cut in half as a large portion of these chanting individuals
1605280	1615600	are soaked up into the arm of this massive monster that then grows and grows its arm first.
1617440	1623440	About twice the size it was before as the ooze slowly forms out over the rest of its being.
1624400	1635200	And Rosemary leaps from a top now 15 stories off the ground and lands.
1635200	1639920	Her body does not touch the ground as the four tentacles from the back of her neck slam
1639920	1642640	themselves into the luminous land below.
1643360	1648880	And it kind of holds her up and she makes direct eye contact with the overseer.
1650560	1652240	Keith, it's your turn.
1652320	1657040	Am I just like following Don or how about I tell you, I'm just following Don.
1658240	1662080	And I get into the same room that he's in with the one candle
1662080	1666720	and I look around and it's just everything is dark except the candle.
1667520	1672000	And I just stare right at the candle and go over to it and blow it out.
1672000	1678560	And then I just lay down on the ground and my heart rate kind of slows down and I just take a
1679360	1683040	ah and lay on the ground.
1690800	1694400	The traditional action turn of a Delta Green character.
1695280	1696880	Clark Bishop, it is your turn.
1696880	1699920	And take a breather, take a little nice nap on the ground.
1699920	1703280	Yeah, Clark is gonna lay down and
1703280	1711920	No, Clark wants to he's been this whole time he's been doing his best to kind of keep up with the
1711920	1716160	steps that somehow everybody already knows this this circular dance he wants he doesn't want to
1716160	1721120	look stupid so he's trying his best to keep going in that dance he stumbles over some people here
1721120	1726480	and there but he's wanting to make his way up to get as close to Clark Gold as he can
1727680	1731200	or the overseer and he wants to kind of shout
1731200	1737440	hey um I'm here I think I did thanks I thanks thanks for getting us here I think
1738240	1742000	I don't know what I'm supposed to do now could I do I do you need me to do something

1808960	1819520	going good here and his feet are like shuffling back and forth not very shark teelie and overseer
1824640	1833920	the wind got sucked out of his sails pretty quick there um roll unnatural please oh my god

2113280	2120480	can't this is supposed to fix things it's what what happened keith you hear him saying this is
2120480	2123760	you're the only other person in the room you didn't hear what was on the other end of the line
2124320	2130480	but he's devastated what's wrong this is just enjoy what's around you are you
2130480	2139120	are you fucking kidding me what the fuck is wrong with you boy oh nothing at all right now he uh
2139120	2144240	grabs you by the collar again like he did earlier when he was trying to help you but much more
2144240	2150480	threatening this time keith is just extremely relaxed and and kind of limp john it's your turn
2151040	2158720	the small hole that had been like deepening sinking into the ground has expanded it
2158720	2164160	disappeared in a flash and there's there's a there's a technicolor swirl there now
2164720	2170640	it's whirlpooling around in light and and sound and if you were near the whole wind
2171280	2177520	all of a sudden it's so much bigger than the little silver ball and it grows and it grows
2177520	2184000	and it grows the light kind of disappears from it and all of a sudden you see like the night sky
2184640	2194320	and from what to you is the ground but what to them is is the air falls upward planet juggernaut
2195920	2201600	keith beans and clark bishop and a john lee pettymore
2203520	2210480	holy shit keith and clark are both wearing bomb squad gear like the hurt locker
2211040	2216560	and you would recognize this as the gear that they had on in the scrap pit
2220400	2229920	john looks confused but relaxed keith and clark literally still have like the bloodlust coursing
2229920	2237600	through them from the arena you see clark has these these weird gloves on they're like
2238560	2245520	magnetic pneumatic hands and he's kind of like punching them and he's ready for a fucking tussle
2245520	2250640	after he gets over his brief surprise when like gravity flips on them and they fall from the sky
2250640	2260880	up into your world keith has his nitro gun that he used to freeze 37 members of the of the crowd
2260880	2266240	on family night at the scrap pit and in his other hand he has this crossbow that appears to shoot
2266320	2277120	the blades from like circular saws and john looks like he's just come from a couch his shoes are off
2277120	2286080	he's you see his like sweaty socks he's he's still got this huge look of surprise on his face from
2286080	2292800	where planet juggernaut clark bishop and keith but not the clark bishop and keith from his timeline
2292800	2298880	have collected him from the house of clark bishop's parents after after he watched keith
2298880	2305520	disappear into into a door and clark disappear into his book and he took a moment to just watch
2305520	2312160	wheel of fortune at clark's house that's this john he doesn't look ready for this world like
2312720	2321840	like keith and clark do and planet juggernaut but the whole like they shoot up out of it and then
2321840	2327840	kind of plop down as they as they encounter the gravity of this world and the hole disappears
2327840	2334960	underneath them it just sucks back up and they land on solid ground in fighting pose like in
2334960	2342480	an anime or like cartoon fighting style fucking clark and keith are down at the base of this
2342480	2350880	towering planet juggernaut who also has his hands out with his mickey mouse gloves and he's got them
2350880	2357200	he's got them ready for a fight as well john falls out of the air and lands flat on his back
2357760	2364720	and doesn't know what's happening and above above it all you see a tiny silver ball just like
2364720	2373600	floating and the camera pans around to where we see a 2d scene essentially like a fighting video
2373600	2386400	game and on the left side of the screen we have gigantam propithecus and rose mxry versus the
2386400	2398000	overseer and planet juggernaut out of a tiny vacuum in planet juggernaut you see these two
2398000	2402400	you know like when the urakai get born in lord of the rings when they're pulled out of the muck
2403120	2408400	out of like those kind of sacks the two announcers from the scrap pit get thrown
2411360	2420800	and land yes let's take a look at the situation right hand here if it was up to me to decide
2420800	2425680	what's going on here i'd say we got a pretty good fight on our hands what do you think dick
