0	3120	Greetings and salutations, my pack.
3120	6460	It's your hellacious howler, Wolf the Dog,
6460	12840	and I am shoutin' at you live from 694.2 PTBP.
12840	16500	My screams can be heard no matter where you are,
16500	20260	as long as you are tuned into the very good numbers.
20260	23000	That's how radios work, I think.
23000	27720	One thing that always works is the adoration of the public.
27720	31060	It just gets my crawdads boilin'.
31060	35260	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Josh in Maryland.
35260	38980	They tweeted about the show and tagged at PretendingPod.
38980	42720	Wow, thanks, Josh. I really appreciate it.
42720	43860	They write,
43860	46900	Thank you all for your excellent show.
46900	50520	I cannot wait to see what season two brings.
50520	53020	You introduced me to Delta Green,
53020	56600	and I've made that all of my friends' problems.
56600	60100	So far, they have sustained major casualties
60100	64100	in both Lover in the Ice and The Last Equation.
64100	67980	Shout-out to Deathwatch and the Raven Inquisition,
67980	71280	the best friends to play an RPG with.
71280	74640	Damn, Josh. Thank you, my child.
74640	79780	We here at PTBP love it when you make something you love
79780	81940	everyone else's problem.
81940	84780	Just ask all of my friends.
84780	89080	I have literally so many of these things called friends.
89080	91740	I'm definitely not super lonely,
91740	94240	sittin' in this studio for all time
94240	98880	with only my producer and dog, Wolf the Dog.
98880	103840	I definitely don't long to share a warm garbage parfait
103840	106380	with another under the flickering lights
106380	110040	in the parking lot of the long-abandoned supermarket
110040	111880	called Cream for Less.
111880	115680	The stars and moon cast in an otherworldly glow
115680	119680	upon our yogurt-covered claws and maws.
119680	123140	Yeah, I definitely don't care about none of that.
123140	125340	Ahem. Huh.
125340	129340	Well, uh, if you want to write up something for your wolf to howl,
129340	131680	tag at Pretending Pod on the Internet
131680	134880	or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts
134880	137180	and holler at us about it.
137180	140180	Say it loud to the person on your left,
140180	141980	at Pretending Pod.
141980	145180	Now say it loud to the person on your right,
145180	147020	at Pretending Pod.
147020	150520	Say it out loud to your friend Beth's dad.
150520	154180	Say it out loud to your fest-drenned Brad,
154180	157020	at Pretending Pod.
157020	159940	And now, the news.
159940	162940	Last time, Lafayette J. Honeycutt
162940	167140	landed on the roof of the great chauffeur party building
167140	169940	with his Fuck Yo Gravity machine.
169940	174200	He then came face to face with a otherworldly creature.
174200	177440	It scuttled across the top of the building toward him
177440	179200	as he failed miserably
179200	182200	at an attempt to pop down to ground level.
182200	185700	The lit towel rained down a bevy of debris,
185700	189440	including a burning timber that drove checkers down
189440	191940	and pinned him into the snowdrift.
191940	194700	Thankfully, Harvey Brewer was nearby
194700	196940	to help his future cult leader,
196940	199440	and in a downpour of good luck,
199440	202440	Honeycutt blasted the flying monsters
202440	204940	with a jetpack fart to the face
204940	208940	and flipped down next to Harvey and checkers with ease.
208940	213940	Meanwhile, Elden Ring became Dark Soul.
213940	219440	That led to Mr. Soul being shot by his ex-leader checkers.
219440	223940	This was, of course, followed by the sounds of screaming,
223940	225940	electrical discharge,
225940	229940	and the air being absolutely filled with the buzzing
229940	231940	of these twisted winged beasts
231940	236440	with pulsating crenulations across their jagged heads.
236440	238940	It's a swarm, y'all.
238940	241940	And now, for the first time,
241940	247440	a brand new song here for 694.2 PTBP.
247440	251440	It's Isabelle Crane with Hollow.
251440	254940	I didn't know
254940	257940	a body could be hollow
257940	262940	before its blood ran cold.
265940	268940	I didn't know
268940	272940	that the wind could soak
272940	277940	the tissue and faggot bone.
278940	281940	You were hollow
281940	285440	and you spoke to me.
287440	292440	Hollow and you sang.
294440	300440	I thought you might be starving,
300440	307440	so I gave you everything.
308940	313440	I feel so low energy after your kind of hype there.
315440	319440	Well, something was said right before we cut to the 30 seconds of silence
319440	323440	that made Scott literally say the phrase,
323440	327440	Jesus wept.
327440	329440	And it reminded me,
329440	331440	we used to play Bible trivia
331440	332940	when our Sunday school teacher
332940	336440	didn't have anything prepared for us on Sunday morning,
336440	339940	and Bible trivia was a game that was like, you know,
339940	341940	Trivial Pursuit, whatever, is in a box
341940	343940	and so we'd bust it out and play.
343940	345940	And the question was,
345940	348440	what is the shortest verse in the Bible?
348440	351940	And my friend's younger sister said,
351940	355940	enthusiastically as anyone has ever proclaimed any two words,
355940	357940	Jesus wept.
357940	359940	Jesus wept.
362940	365940	No, Jesus used the three cells.
366440	371440	Yeah, he didn't come to wash away mankind's sins,
371440	373440	just to wipe them away.
373440	375440	Just smudge them a bit.
375440	377440	Yeah, from back to front too.
377440	379440	Jesus was a freak.
379440	381440	Yeah, and they didn't have bidets back then,
381440	383440	so, ugh.
383440	385440	Oh my God.
385440	386940	And for you listening at home,
386940	388440	if you don't have a bidet,
388440	390440	we're not living in Jesus times anymore.
390440	391440	You can get one.
391440	392440	They're relatively inexpensive
392440	394440	and it keeps your butthole happy.
394440	397940	Brought to you by, I'm Googling bidet company.
397940	399940	We need to reach out.
399940	401940	If we could get a sponsor for the podcast
401940	403940	that wasn't like, just like Bomba socks or whatever
403940	405940	every time, it would be cool
405940	407940	if we were just exclusively sponsored
407940	409940	by a bidet brand.
409940	411940	Brought to you by,
411940	413940	Brought to you by Tushy.
413940	415940	Oh, that's a good one.
415940	419940	Today only, if you type in the code PTBP
419940	421940	and then delete it off there,
421940	423940	you can buy, if you buy two bidets,
423940	426940	you can save $90 at Tushy.com.
426940	429940	And if you use Honey, it'll probably help.
431940	434440	If your arsehole could speak, it would thank you.
434440	436940	Oh, that's a hell of a tagline.
438940	440940	Thomas, what do you think about that?
441940	443940	Our Jimmy John's came, Scott.
443940	445940	We've got delicious Jimmy John's incoming.
445940	446940	That was freaky fast.
446940	448940	That was freaky fast.
448940	451940	Your sandwich place is called Jimmy John's?
451940	452940	Jimmy John's, yep.
452940	453940	Oh, Jimmy John's. Oh, sorry.
453940	454940	I thought you said Jimmy John's.
454940	457940	I was expecting it to come with flavor aid.
461940	462940	Holy shit.
462940	464940	The Jim Jones.
464940	466940	Is this going to be like some special Patreon content
466940	469940	where it's just like eating sounds for 10 minutes?
469940	470940	Oh, God.
470940	471940	Dibbing up of sandwiches.
471940	474940	So we literally have to split off in our very first episode.
474940	476940	There's a doorbell that rings like four minutes
476940	479940	into our very first recording.
479940	481940	Jimmy John's just showed up at the door
481940	484940	and Luke went to the door and the guy was like,
484940	485940	what are you guys up to today?
485940	488940	And Luke was like, oh, we're playing a role playing game.
488940	490940	And the guy was like, oh, sweet.
490940	492940	Have you ever heard of Delta Green?
494940	496940	And Luke was like, dude, I'm not kidding.
496940	498940	That is what we're playing.
501940	502940	Brilliant.
502940	503940	And then I didn't say like, hey, we're recording.
503940	504940	You should listen to this thing
504940	506940	that will come out in two years.
507940	509940	Well, that guy was Joe.
511940	512940	Can I play?
512940	514940	It was called Jimmy Joe's back then.
517940	518940	What are we going to do?
518940	520940	Hoover down a few bites.
520940	522940	Take your time.
522940	524940	I don't want to see any of you choking to death
524940	526940	trying to catch the game in a hurry.
526940	527940	It's a horror game, Scott.
527940	528940	Psychic attack!
528940	529940	Psychic attack!
534940	536940	Well, I think everyone's stopped crunching chips.
536940	538940	Yeah, I'm ready to go.
538940	539940	Fantastic.
541940	542940	Does someone want to do a recap
542940	545940	and then we can move on to the death?
545940	547940	There was a heavy betrayal.
547940	548940	Oh, man, yeah.
548940	550940	Luke really betrayed me.
552940	554940	But then kind of a reconciliation sort of.
554940	555940	I don't know what happened at the end there
555940	558940	where he was first aiding you after having shot you.
558940	559940	I know, it's wild.
559940	562940	Well, I was pissed that I could feel you betraying me
562940	565940	in real time and then I didn't want to kill you,
565940	567940	but I had to stop you psychic attacking me.
567940	571940	I'd like to read something from the psychic attack part
571940	574940	of the Pulp Cthulhu handbook.
574940	577940	It says, I can.
579940	580940	Okay, I can.
580940	582940	Sounds like you're making it up already.
582940	584940	I'll read the whole thing then, I guess.
584940	586940	It says that I can.
588940	590940	And I do.
591940	593940	The psychic may attempt a psychic attack
593940	595940	if the target is in line of sight.
595940	598940	If the initial opposed power roll is failed,
598940	601940	the psychic hero may attempt another power roll
601940	603940	on their turn in the following round.
603940	607940	The second attempt effectively works like a push roll.
607940	609940	If the second attempt fails,
609940	613940	the target of the attack can never be targeted again
613940	615940	by the same psychic.
615940	616940	Wow.
616940	618940	So I don't know if you read that, Scott,
618940	622940	as like two psychic attacks back to back in one combat.
622940	624940	Okay, so then I've done it once.
624940	626940	So if I do it again and fail,
626940	629940	then I'll never be able to psychic attack you ever again.
629940	632940	And then that would restore my trust in you.
633940	635940	Yeah, so don't think of it as a psychic attack.
635940	638940	Think of it as an inoculation.
638940	639940	Right.
639940	642940	Oh, and if I fail, it works like a pushed roll.
642940	644940	So something suitably bad happens.
644940	646940	Possible consequences might include
646940	648940	bleeding from ears and eyes,
648940	651940	sanity loss and instant delusion,
651940	656940	incapacitation by shaking and spasms, et cetera.
656940	657940	Nice.
657940	658940	I like et cetera, too.
658940	660940	Yeah, et cetera sounds crazy.
660940	661940	Yes.
661940	664940	Anyway, that could be bad, huh?
664940	665940	Could be bad.
665940	667940	But I'm sure you wouldn't be silly enough to do that,
667940	668940	would you?
668940	669940	God, no.
669940	672940	There's no way of telling, honestly.
672940	674940	So shall we open up with that then
674940	676940	with the two of you down there in the cellar,
676940	680940	patching things up both figuratively and literally?
680940	681940	But why?
681940	682940	Why did you do it?
682940	686940	You should join us.
686940	688940	I'm not sure what any of it is.
688940	689940	I don't know what the invention is.
689940	690940	I don't know what that thing was.
690940	692940	I don't know what you're trying to get me to join.
692940	696940	Well, you didn't know what anything was before,
696940	698940	and you were still the face of that.
698940	699940	Fair enough.
699940	702940	His mind has been changed.
702940	704940	Oh, yes.
704940	705940	Delta.
705940	709940	Green.
709940	712940	Well, let's, I mean, we got you patched up
712940	714940	as much as I can do right here, but...
714940	716940	I'm feeling much better, thank you.
716940	717940	There's probably a doctor.
717940	718940	Friend.
718940	721940	There's scientists and academics and everything.
721940	723940	There's got to be a doctor.
723940	725940	Hey, I want you to know,
725940	727940	just because you're no longer my master
727940	729940	does not mean that we cannot be friends.
729940	730940	Huh?
730940	733940	I can teach you the ways of this creature,
733940	734940	and you can learn.
734940	735940	But I'm in charge, though.
735940	738940	Assuredly, but you can learn from me.
738940	739940	Hmm.
739940	742940	I think you lost a lot of blood or something,
742940	745940	and you're not making no sense.
745940	747940	And I think with that as well,
747940	750940	you can start hearing all the screaming and crying
750940	753940	and strange, you know, crashing sounds from outside.
753940	756940	A little bit of Checkers charm pops into his head,
756940	759940	and he's like, hey, they're missing us out there.
759940	762940	Yeah, a little bit of Monica in my life.
762940	763940	Right.
764940	767940	A little bit of Sandra in the sun.
767940	769940	A little bit of Jessica.
769940	771940	I help you walk up the stairs,
771940	774940	and we'll head out of this horrifying dungeon.
774940	775940	Thank you, friend.
775940	778940	And meanwhile, upstairs, Lafayette and Harvey,
778940	780940	you'd heard all the chaos as well
780940	782940	from deeper within the building.
782940	783940	What are you doing?
783940	787940	I was having a bout of not feeling so great mentally.
787940	788940	Am I still having that?
788940	789940	Yes.
789940	790940	You are.
790940	792940	Yeah, absolute panic.
792940	794940	You've got to get out of here as soon as possible,
794940	797940	and I mean, you know where the front door is.
797940	799940	I mean, you know, if you just run out of there,
799940	801940	I'm sure you'll be fine.
801940	802940	I'm charging ahead.
804940	805940	Okay.
805940	807940	So, yeah, Lafayette can see Harvey
807940	809940	just legging it down the corridor
809940	811940	full speed away from him.
811940	812940	How many legs?
812940	813940	Yeah, I was gonna ask.
815940	816940	I started with 13.
816940	817940	You didn't know that?
819940	822940	He's running at, what, just over 100 miles an hour?
823940	826940	He's done that in, like, the same direction
826940	828940	that the creature just flew off, basically?
828940	829940	Oh, yeah. Yeah.
829940	831940	Yeah, he's running towards the chaos.
831940	835940	Lafayette looks down, like, either side of the hallway
835940	838940	and then closes the door behind him and locks it.
838940	840940	Like, while you're in the room?
840940	841940	Yeah.
841940	844940	And then he starts going through the shit in Cicero's room.
844940	847940	Well, I mean, the shit in Cicero's room
847940	851940	largely consists of blood-splattered furnishings,
851940	856940	blood-splattered bedding, blood-splattered carpet,
856940	858940	blood-splattered corpse,
858940	863940	the syringe and the strange liquid,
863940	867940	blood-splattered ceiling, blood-splattered light fixtures.
867940	870940	Blood-splattered love letters he never sent you.
872940	875940	I try to open any blood-splattered drawers
875940	877940	or cabinets and find, you know,
877940	879940	is there anything in his bedside table,
879940	883940	any super sentimental knick-knack
883940	888940	that I can take to just really rub in the world's, you know,
888940	891940	I guess I wouldn't show it off too much, but still.
891940	892940	You would know.
892940	893940	Ego.
893940	894940	Yeah.
896940	900940	Oh, gosh, what kinds of knick-knacks might he have?
900940	905940	Yeah, I guess there's a lock of blonde hair
905940	907940	that's tied with a ribbon.
909940	910940	Was his wife?
910940	913940	I see that, and I look at it, and I kind of toss it away,
913940	915940	and I see, like, propped up next to the bed
915940	918940	is that stupid self-playing violin, and I take that.
918940	919940	Yes.
919940	920940	And I...
920940	922940	It's out of tune already.
922940	926940	And I look at the weird, you know, the stuff he was injecting.
926940	929940	I can see the track marks on his arms and shit.
930940	933940	And I pocket that as well.
933940	934940	Okay.
934940	936940	And then are you two running up those same stairs
936940	937940	out of that wardrobe?
937940	939940	Yeah, I think at this point the two of them
939940	941940	do burst out of the wardrobe.
941940	943940	Well, hello, chaps.
943940	945940	We got to go help or something.
945940	947940	What are you doing?
947940	949940	As screams are coming from the...
949940	951940	What's down there?
951940	953940	I don't know, something bad.
953940	955940	Oh, where we just came from.
955940	956940	Yeah.
956940	957940	Something bad.
957940	958940	Did you see it fly out of there?
958940	959940	It's gone, yes.
959940	962940	That was down there, and it took him...
962940	964940	He's fucked up because he's thinking
964940	966940	that that thing's his master, but I am.
966940	968940	The new invention of Cicero Morgan
968940	970940	is going to change the world, you know?
970940	972940	And he's saying that shit.
972940	975940	Just like everybody down there.
975940	977940	It's going to change the world, you know?
977940	979940	Also, the last branch, you should get in early
979940	981940	because it's about to take off.
983940	984940	No. No.
984940	986940	God damn it, no.
986940	988940	Lafayette J. Honeycutt is about to take off.
988940	992940	He did take off in his amazing jet pack.
992940	994940	I don't know who that is, David.
994940	996940	I am Lafayette J. Honeycutt.
996940	998940	Whoa!
998940	999940	The whole time?
999940	1001940	Yeah, he parts his hair to the other side.
1001940	1003940	Dramatically.
1003940	1005940	Checkers recalls, he's like,
1005940	1007940	I've seen him in the magazines.
1007940	1009940	That's right, you have.
1009940	1010940	I am the best inventor.
1010940	1013940	You're the second best inventor on Earth?
1013940	1016940	Well, and then I see him.
1016940	1018940	I'm like, well, the best now.
1018940	1021940	I was the best before.
1021940	1023940	I made this kick-ass jet pack.
1023940	1025940	Can you invent us something to get out of here?
1025940	1026940	Alive?
1026940	1027940	A jet pack!
1027940	1029940	Us, not you.
1029940	1033940	So Honeycutt, does that mean that I am the vessel
1033940	1036940	that followed through with the energy focus
1036940	1040940	in order to make you the successful man
1040940	1043940	without any sort of rival to speak of?
1043940	1045940	This is exactly what I was saying.
1045940	1048940	He's lost it.
1048940	1051940	If so, I think any invention that you come up with tonight
1051940	1055940	and show off could change the world, you know?
1055940	1058940	Oh, well, have you seen my jet pack?
1058940	1061940	I kind of turn around and I flash it to him.
1061940	1063940	I'm like, eh?
1063940	1065940	Is it cool?
1065940	1067940	It's very cool.
1067940	1069940	I think if you want to work out how cool this is,
1069940	1071940	you'd have to lick it.
1071940	1073940	Yeah.
1073940	1074940	Do you mind?
1074940	1077940	Yeah, I also give him just a little push.
1077940	1079940	I spread a little flame out the back.
1079940	1080940	Ooh.
1080940	1082940	Just revving the engine, just a little.
1082940	1083940	Huh?
1083940	1084940	Look at that.
1084940	1086940	I think with all the blood and tissue around,
1086940	1089940	there's just this brief smell of cooking meat.
1089940	1093940	Yeah, it just like singes.
1093940	1095940	Well, we got to get him to a doctor
1095940	1098940	and figure out what the hell's going on out there.
1098940	1100940	Well, it sounds like a lot of people are screaming
1100940	1104940	and dying out there, so what if we just stayed in here?
1104940	1106940	That was sort of my plan.
1106940	1109940	Well, and what, wait for them to come to us?
1109940	1111940	No, wait for everything to leave.
1111940	1112940	They know we're up here.
1112940	1115940	That thing had holes drilled in its head and it's mad.
1115940	1117940	It seemed like it just wanted to get out of here.
1117940	1118940	It's gone.
1118940	1120940	I'm going to survive.
1120940	1121940	I sure hope so.
1121940	1123940	I shot him.
1123940	1124940	Sorry.
1124940	1125940	It's okay.
1125940	1126940	I think I'm going to be protected.
1126940	1127940	Split up.
1127940	1128940	Wait, what? Why?
1128940	1130940	Okay, you take care of him then,
1130940	1132940	and I unlock the doors and go investigate the scene.
1132940	1136940	Wow, he's going to be deeply unsafe now.
1136940	1139940	Why don't you go see what's going on out there for me?
1139940	1140940	Could you do that?
1140940	1143940	Yeah, I'm not going to be harmed by this creature
1143940	1147940	or any of its friends, so of course, yeah, that seems fine.
1147940	1148940	Perfect.
1148940	1150940	You go down there and see what's going on
1150940	1151940	and report back to me.
1151940	1153940	Yeah, I'll let everybody know you're up here.
1153940	1154940	I kind of shuttle you out the door after.
1154940	1155940	No, no, no, no, no, no.
1155940	1157940	Don't do that.
1157940	1160940	Don't tell anyone.
1160940	1162940	Well, in order to make sure that tonight goes off without a hitch,
1162940	1166940	everyone should know where everyone is.
1166940	1169940	You understand that tonight has just been one big hitch, right?
1169940	1172940	No, it's a party.
1172940	1173940	Sorry.
1173940	1178940	The hitches have already gone off.
1178940	1183940	You know, I'll just go with you two.
1183940	1184940	It's a party.
1184940	1185940	Sorry.
1185940	1189940	Well, Harvey's got a head start, so let's catch up with him.
1189940	1194940	So in your panic to get out, you've run to the main stairs
1194940	1198940	and you were going to head to the exit,
1198940	1200940	but now that you're on the stairs,
1200940	1202940	you're beginning to come out of this panic
1202940	1207940	and you can see that it is carnage down below.
1207940	1211940	There are people running around all over the place
1211940	1215940	and there are a number of these flying creatures
1215940	1217940	buzzing through the air around them.
1217940	1220940	A few of them are holding these devices
1220940	1223940	that look a bit like cameras maybe.
1223940	1225940	The people are terrified.
1225940	1227940	Some of them are trying to get outside.
1227940	1230940	You can see there are a few bodies on the ground.
1230940	1232940	People are getting trampled.
1232940	1234940	What do you do?
1234940	1236940	Has anything noticed me?
1236940	1238940	Notice me.
1238940	1239940	What?
1239940	1240940	Give me a luck roll.
1240940	1242940	Give me a luck roll.
1244940	1246940	It's a 21 on a 59.
1246940	1249940	I mean, a couple of people run past you up the stairs.
1249940	1252940	There are some of these creatures buzzing around,
1252940	1256940	but nothing seems to have taken a lively interest in you yet,
1256940	1259940	but it's probably only a matter of time.
1259940	1263940	Can you give me an idea of the number of these bug creature things?
1263940	1266940	Is it like 20 of them or is it like three or four of them?
1266940	1269940	At the moment, you're mainly looking into the hallway
1269940	1272940	and you can see about half a dozen of them here,
1272940	1276940	but there's sounds of buzzing from outside.
1276940	1280940	You hear some strange crackling noises from out there as well.
1280940	1284940	And there's pandemonium in the ballroom as well.
1284940	1287940	The band, funnily enough, has stopped playing at this stage.
1287940	1290940	Oh, no, the music.
1290940	1295940	The party's not going off without a hitch.
1295940	1298940	If I'm starting to regain my senses at this point,
1298940	1301940	he's remembered that he's abandoned his employer,
1301940	1303940	the person he's only supposed to protect.
1303940	1308940	So he's going to look back down the hallway and see if he is followed.
1308940	1312940	Yeah, and as you do so, you can see the others moving towards you,
1312940	1314940	silhouetted by the light from Gordon's room.
1314940	1318940	And I'm going to try and tell him to slow down and be quiet.
1318940	1319940	Yeah, it's easy to see that.
1319940	1321940	Let's just go back and lock ourselves in that room.
1321940	1324940	I slow down a little bit, but I kind of blow by Harvey
1324940	1327940	and I'm like, come on, you'll be the most help.
1327940	1330940	I grab him by the scruff of his collar.
1330940	1334940	Hey, buddy, listen, there's a lot of them down there.
1334940	1335940	I can't take them alone.
1335940	1337940	I don't think four of us can take them either.
1337940	1339940	What's them?
1339940	1341940	You saw that thing that came out of the cellar?
1341940	1342940	I shot it.
1342940	1343940	There's a lot of those.
1343940	1347940	Just so you know, I shot it and nothing happened at all.
1347940	1349940	So do you want to go fight those now?
1349940	1352940	There's got to be a way, or they could join the cult
1352940	1355940	and be the most powerful members of the cult.
1356940	1358940	Where did this voice come from?
1361940	1364940	The most powerful members of our cult.
1367940	1369940	Everything about me is a fraud.
1369940	1372940	So I don't really even have an actual voice.
1375940	1378940	So you're having this conversation at the top of the stairs.
1378940	1380940	Unfortunately, it sounds like it.
1382940	1384940	So while you're having this conversation,
1384940	1390940	you see Margaret Payne running pursued by one of these creatures.
1390940	1394940	Another one of them wields this camera-like device
1394940	1399940	and seems to be trying to point it actually in your direction.
1399940	1403940	But this bolt of energy shoots out of it
1403940	1410940	and hits the mounting for the chandelier in the hallway.
1410940	1412940	And you see the chandelier come down
1412940	1416940	and land on Margaret Payne, pinning her to the ground.
1416940	1418940	Oh, Margaret.
1418940	1421940	That beautiful chandelier is ruined.
1424940	1429940	Checkers sees all this and he's thinking like,
1429940	1430940	yeah, I shot that thing.
1430940	1433940	It didn't get affected at all by my gun,
1433940	1439940	but I did see, fucking not Fayetteville, Lafayette.
1439940	1442940	I saw Lafayette burn one to death.
1442940	1443940	Fayetteville, D'Artagnan.
1443940	1444940	Fayetteville.
1444940	1446940	I saw Fayetteville burn one to death.
1446940	1450940	So because I can't move because Harvey's got his grip on me,
1450940	1455940	I pull my lighter back out and I try to just set the picture on the wall on fire.
1455940	1458940	Stop setting shit on fire, dude.
1460940	1462940	I'm just picturing in amongst all this chaos,
1462940	1465940	you're standing there almost casually with your arm out
1465940	1468940	as this picture frame slowly smoulders.
1470940	1472940	My plan is to hide out in a room.
1472940	1474940	I was going to lock myself in a room on the second floor
1474940	1476940	and you're about to burn me out, dude.
1476940	1477940	Well, I wasn't going to do that
1477940	1479940	and I figured you'd just come along with us.
1479940	1481940	So fire kills him.
1481940	1483940	And while you're having this debate,
1483940	1486940	you can see Margaret Payne is there,
1486940	1487940	still under the chandelier.
1487940	1489940	She's looking around in panic
1489940	1491940	and she just makes eye contact with you at the top of the stairs,
1491940	1495940	one bloody hand reaching up towards you.
1495940	1499940	And there's one of these creatures that's swooping down,
1499940	1502940	buzzing down towards her menacingly.
1504940	1505940	We got to help Maggie.
1505940	1507940	She's in Margaret Payne.
1510940	1513940	Now's the moment for a gentleman to shine, I suppose,
1513940	1516940	and I jet pack down the hallway.
1518940	1520940	Fantastic.
1520940	1521940	Are you going for the chandelier?
1521940	1523940	Are you going for the creature that's about to attack her?
1523940	1524940	What are you doing?
1524940	1528940	I'm going to go, yeah, I'm going to go try to intercept it
1528940	1530940	before I can get to her.
1530940	1536940	And I'm like, Harvey, lift that off the lady there, you brute,
1536940	1537940	if you're still with me.
1537940	1541940	I'm following him for sure, but do you hit the creature?
1541940	1542940	We don't know yet.
1542940	1544940	Well, let's find out.
1544940	1548940	So I think this comes down to your 35% piloting roll.
1548940	1550940	I'll let you use that as a combat skill.
1550940	1553940	This thing is going to attack you in return,
1553940	1556940	and it's going to try to bring you down to the ground
1556940	1558940	so it can rip you apart with its pincers.
1562940	1564940	Yeah, 33!
1564940	1565940	33 on a 35?
1565940	1566940	Yeah.
1566940	1568940	Oh, my God, it's a success.
1568940	1569940	Oh, but it's not a crit.
1569940	1570940	Yeah, no crit.
1570940	1572940	But it's a success.
1572940	1574940	Let me just see.
1574940	1575940	I've got a success for it.
1575940	1578940	I'm just checking to see whether it's an ordinary or a hard one.
1579940	1581940	It is an ordinary one.
1581940	1584940	It just missed a hard success by 1%.
1586940	1591940	So, yeah, you slam into this thing at speed.
1591940	1595940	It doesn't have a face, so it's difficult to describe it as looking surprised,
1595940	1597940	but it looks surprised.
1599940	1601940	So what's your plan?
1601940	1604940	Are you trying to take it outside?
1604940	1606940	Are you slamming it into a wall?
1606940	1608940	Are you slamming it into the ground?
1608940	1610940	I am probably as surprised as it is,
1610940	1614940	and I am just going to try to jetpack away.
1614940	1616940	I don't know if I can get it to follow me,
1616940	1619940	but I basically want to try to lead it away.
1619940	1620940	You've got a hold of it, I think.
1620940	1621940	You've got it.
1621940	1623940	I mean, basically, you've barreled into it.
1623940	1624940	You've got hold of it.
1624940	1625940	Right.
1625940	1628940	Then I hold it tight, and I'm like,
1628940	1630940	oh, what's something clever to say, boys?
1630940	1633940	Always the thing that you want, huh?
1634940	1635940	Say that.
1636940	1641940	Yeah, I say, well, you can't always get what you want, I suppose.
1643940	1646940	Something about this party has been bugging me.
1647940	1650940	I say, fuck you, bug man.
1653940	1655940	And as I'm holding it tight,
1655940	1661940	yeah, I'm going to try to just drop it into a wall with some momentum,
1661940	1663940	bowl it a little bit.
1663940	1665940	Okay, so, I mean, as you're doing that,
1665940	1668940	I think it's going to have one chance to attack you,
1668940	1670940	because as you're holding onto it,
1670940	1675940	it becomes very apparent in just how many sharp appendages it has,
1675940	1678940	and it's bringing a couple of these big pincers up
1678940	1681940	to see whether it can remove your face.
1684940	1687940	How are you trying to prevent it from removing your face?
1688940	1692940	I think I'm going to try to take some wild maneuvers with the,
1692940	1694940	like, if I see him going for a swipe,
1694940	1699940	I'm going to try to, like, do a big drop with the jet pack.
1699940	1701940	So you can use your pilot as a defensive skill,
1701940	1703940	and give that a try.
1705940	1706940	93.
1708940	1710940	Okay, I got a success.
1710940	1717940	So, yeah, this creature has brought its claw up,
1717940	1720940	and, oof, this could hurt.
1722940	1725940	I think you should clip that and put it at the beginning of the first episode.
1725940	1727940	Ooh, this could hurt.
1728940	1733940	So that's six hit points of damage as this pincer closes on your face.
1733940	1737940	I mean, it takes a chunk of meat off the end of your nose,
1737940	1739940	and there's blood running down into your mouth.
1740940	1742940	You bastard.
1743940	1744940	I say.
1744940	1745940	I say.
1745940	1746940	Good man.
1747940	1751940	And with that, you said you were going to try to throw it into a ball.
1752940	1753940	Yeah.
1753940	1758940	Okay, I think it's going to try to hold on to you as you do that.
1759940	1764940	So, yeah, if you want to give me again your pilot roll,
1764940	1771940	and I shall roll again for its, sink its sharp appendages into Lafayette roll.
1772940	1777940	I'd like to do just a fast-talk roll to it to say don't.
1778940	1780940	He says it real fast, though.
1780940	1781940	I roll to 0-3.
1781940	1782940	Oof.
1783940	1784940	I rolled a 20.
1785940	1787940	Okay, so it beats you.
1787940	1788940	Yeah.
1788940	1791940	And so, yeah, I mean, you try to throw it away from you,
1791940	1799940	but as you do so, it sinks its sharp claws and the ends of its legs into your flesh.
1799940	1801940	And as you try throwing it away from your body,
1801940	1809940	you can just feel multiple rips in your body as it holds onto you for dear life.
1809940	1814940	Because that's an extreme roll, it does maximum damage on this.
1814940	1816940	So that is...
1817940	1818940	Ow!
1819940	1821940	So, yes, that is 10 hit points of damage.
1822940	1823940	Ouchy ouchy.
1823940	1827940	Is that 16 that you just within a second?
1828940	1829940	Yes.
1829940	1833940	My current hit points now are, that was 10 just then?
1833940	1834940	Yeah.
1834940	1835940	Yeah, so I'm down to 9.
1835940	1836940	So that's good.
1836940	1840940	Okay, so you're still wrestling with this creature in the air.
1840940	1843940	What's everyone else doing while this is going on?
1843940	1849940	Can Harvey see that happening and he wants to run up and punch this thing off of him?
1849940	1851940	It's got to be quite difficult to do,
1851940	1855940	because the two of them are pretty much bouncing off the ceiling and the walls all around you,
1855940	1857940	moving at speed.
1857940	1860940	So it's not only like trying to hit a pinata,
1860940	1863940	but it's like trying to hit a pinata that's actively running away from you.
1863940	1868940	Well, if that's the case, if I don't think it's possible, then I would help try to get Margaret out from another chandelier.
1868940	1871940	Okay, yeah, you can give me a strength roll to do that.
1873940	1875940	That's a 50 on a 90?
1875940	1880940	Yeah, you manage to lift the chandelier off her and she's quite bloody and bruised,
1880940	1883940	but she drags herself out from underneath it and says,
1883940	1888940	Oh, thank you so much. I thought I was done for there.
1888940	1890940	We need to get to 6.
1890940	1893940	Safety, we're safe. Where is safe?
1893940	1896940	Shall we get a car and get out of here?
1896940	1899940	Sorry, the car's not an option. They're destroyed out there.
1899940	1904940	There was nobody upstairs. That's probably the most safe place at this point right now.
1904940	1907940	All right, yes, yes, I'll do that.
1907940	1913940	And she starts limping up the stairs as fast as her damaged legs will take her.
1913940	1917940	At the top of the stairs, Checkers is trying to light things up.
1917940	1922940	At the top of the stairs, Checkers is trying to light fires.
1922940	1929940	Well, you are being beaten to the punch slightly because you can see where these things,
1929940	1933940	the ones that are armed with these things that look like cameras have been firing them,
1933940	1938940	that there are bits of the wall and ceiling now which are beginning to catch fire.
1941940	1943940	Perfect.
1943940	1947940	Yeah, we're on their side now, so this seems fine.
1949940	1953940	Elden, what do we do now? That's your master.
1953940	1955940	Yeah, I'm looking for the religion man.
1955940	1956940	The Reverend.
1956940	1960940	Okay, give me, actually give me a listen roll.
1962940	1964940	Ooh, 14 on a 50.
1964940	1970940	So you don't see him, but you hear from the ballroom his voice and it's loud.
1970940	1976940	It's cutting through the chaos and he's shouting in absolute fury,
1976940	1979940	you idiots, you are ruining this.
1979940	1981940	You are ruining everything.
1982940	1987940	Come on guys, we should go talk to the man with the collar.
1989940	1990940	I follow you.
1991940	1999940	So we're going down the stairs as the injured Margaret Payne is being helped up the stairs by Harvey Warby.
1999940	2004940	I think I probably just sent her on her way because my wife is still flying around.
2007940	2009940	She's going to hide under a bed somewhere.
2009940	2010940	Smart.
2010940	2013940	Yeah, I mean the rest of you gather downstairs.
2013940	2019940	There are people running all over the place just trying to get the hell out of here.
2019940	2021940	A couple of them are on fire.
2024940	2025940	There are some on the ground.
2025940	2027940	Immediate laughter from the PTBP crew.
2027940	2029940	Someone was on fire.
2031940	2033940	In the climax of a horror movie.
2035940	2037940	A couple of people on fire, some Wilhelm screams.
2037940	2039940	It's like, this is great.
2039940	2041940	Yeah, it is exactly that.
2041940	2049940	What I would like if you're trying to make your way through to the ballroom is dodge rolls off everyone to avoid being stampeded by the panicking people.
2050940	2051940	10.
2051940	2052940	Uh oh.
2052940	2054940	Hey, I passed a 21 on a 25.
2054940	2055940	94.
2055940	2056940	I fail.
2056940	2061940	So, those of you who failed, so, sorry, was that just Mr. Soul who failed?
2061940	2063940	Soul and Harvey Birdman.
2063940	2064940	No, I passed.
2064940	2065940	Oh, you passed. Sorry, my bad. Just me?
2065940	2066940	Just you.
2066940	2068940	Oh, okay, cool. I thought anyone...
2068940	2072940	So the rest of you are kind of weaving and elbowing your way through the panicking throng.
2072940	2080940	But, yeah, Mr. Soul gets knocked to the ground and someone's foot slams into your face as they're running off.
2080940	2081940	Oh, no.
2081940	2087940	And you take a grand total of one hit point of damage.
2087940	2088940	Oh, no.
2088940	2090940	It was a little dainty foot.
2090940	2092940	Oh, just a little dainty foot.
2092940	2093940	Yeah, it was a size three.
2093940	2095940	It was a child.
2095940	2097940	But the point is, you're down at the ground.
2097940	2106940	The rest of you, through the doors to the ballroom, you can see Reverend Nye is just marching through the panicking crowd.
2106940	2114940	The air is thick with smoke now, and there's more of these creatures buzzing around these electrical arcs flying everywhere.
2114940	2120940	And you see the air around Reverend Nye seems to be shimmering.
2120940	2123940	It's like he has his own personal heat haze around him.
2123940	2132940	His eyes are absolutely black and he just marches up in the direction of one of these flying creatures, shouting,
2132940	2135940	you idiots, you're ruining this, you idiots.
2135940	2140940	And he raises his hand up and there is this shockwave of force.
2140940	2149940	And the creature flies through the air, impacts the wall behind it, and then just splats like a bug on a windshield.
2149940	2151940	We should have just done that.
2151940	2161940	I see that through the crowd of legs and feet, like all through, and I'm like, oh, my God, another one like me.
2161940	2168940	Oh, yeah. I mean, his eyes are absolutely jet black at the moment and the air is shimmering around him with the heat.
2168940	2170940	I can learn so much from this man.
2170940	2174940	I help him off the ground and like try to get him over to the reverend.
2174940	2179940	Yeah, the reverend standing there looking around, his face a mask of fury.
2179940	2188940	And as he sees you coming towards him, Jesse's movement coming towards him, he whips around and raises his hand up again.
2188940	2191940	But pauses for a moment as he sees that it's you.
2191940	2195940	How do I do that, too, so we can eliminate the issues?
2195940	2197940	There is no time.
2197940	2202940	We have to protect Cicero's invention at all cost.
2202940	2211940	It needs to be shown to the world this is such a delicate time, such a precious time.
2211940	2217940	We need to make sure that his invention goes out there and changes the world.
2217940	2220940	Can his invention help get rid of all these things?
2220940	2227940	I don't know. Maybe. I mean, honestly, I don't understand how it works.
2227940	2236940	This is Cicero's doing. But if you think you understand it, then have at it.
2236940	2245940	Dark soul runs over and in one fell swoop grabs onto the canvas atop it and does the big swipe to unveil it.
2245940	2248940	And I want to roll Cthulhu Mythos.
2248940	2252940	Actually, Cthulhu Mythos doesn't really apply.
2252940	2253940	Oh, shit.
2253940	2265940	Yeah, what you're looking at is just basically a big metal box with a number of dials and meters on it.
2265940	2268940	Fuck.
2268940	2275940	Lafayette! David! Help! Science! Science, man!
2275940	2278940	This is beyond my mystical capabilities.
2278940	2284940	I yell and look and see him flying around with a crab person on him.
2284940	2288940	If I get out of that, I've got just the thing for this.
2288940	2294940	Let's see whether Lafayette can get out of this so he can have another try at splatting your bug friend.
2294940	2301940	Can I offer help in some way that maybe I'm such a hulking big mass that maybe I can just try and get my body in the way of them?
2301940	2309940	I'll tell you what. Let's have a dex roll to see whether you can get into a position whereby you can actually attack them.
2309940	2312940	Or at least attack the bug. Maybe not Lafayette.
2316940	2318940	I hit an 11 on a 50.
2318940	2328940	Okay. Yeah, I mean, you reckon if you get up onto the stage, you can probably maybe stage dive onto the flying clusterfuck that's going around you.
2328940	2329940	Yes!
2329940	2331940	Hell yeah, that's what I want to do.
2331940	2333940	Right as the breakdown starts.
2333940	2337940	This is some jingle all the way shit and I am here for it.
2337940	2348940	Could I attempt a biology roll against this creature to find any weak spots? It's a science I have. Science biology.
2348940	2355940	I think because this thing does not follow terrestrial biology, you could make a Cthulhu Mythos roll.
2355940	2364940	Yeah, I don't have anything good there. I guess I'll continue trying to fly against a pilot against it.
2364940	2368940	Yeah, I mean, you can certainly see Harvey getting ready to join in the fray.
2368940	2371940	Yeah, so I'll just try to steer things towards him.
2371940	2378940	Okay. Yeah, then give me a policy roll. This would be a great time to roll a double zero.
2381940	2382940	67.
2382940	2383940	Damn.
2383940	2408940	The good news is that you are heading roughly in the direction where Harvey is. The bad news is, I mean, initially they were flying overhead, but now Lafayette seems to have lost control of this and they've ducked down a bit and you realize that now both he and the creature are cannonballing towards you, Harvey, at speed.
2408940	2414940	I mean, you have a choice about what to do here. You've got maybe half a second before they hit you like a wrecking ball.
2414940	2418940	I want to try and tank the hit and grab onto him to pull him down to the ground.
2418940	2419940	Okay.
2419940	2426940	Yeah, you can make a fighting brawl roll here, and if you fail, this could hurt really badly.
2432940	2433940	Oh, no.
2434940	2439940	I was so fucking excited because I have an 80 in fighting brawl, but I rolled a 98.
2439940	2440940	Oh.
2440940	2444940	I mean, it's not a fumble. You could spend 18 points of luck and make that a success.
2444940	2446940	Oh, hell yeah, that's what I'll do.
2447940	2448940	Yeah.
2448940	2449940	What does that leave you with?
2449940	2450940	What's 59 minus 18?
2450940	2451940	41.
2451940	2458940	You're about to miss, but then you slip on, like, a trumpeter's blood and get a direct hit.
2458940	2460940	Trumpeter's blood.
2460940	2462940	That fucking clarinet is dead.
2464940	2470940	Okay, so you're grabbing hold of this thing as it is barreling towards you.
2470940	2476940	Am I strong enough? Does that roll help me pull them and, like, pull them, or do I get pulled along with them?
2476940	2481940	At the moment, yeah, you're probably getting pulled along with them.
2482940	2493940	So, yeah, I'm imagining it now as the two of you holding on to this creature being piloted by Lafayette's jetpack.
2493940	2503940	Harvey may be holding on to the undercarriage of this creature, and, yeah, the creature is pretty nonplussed by all of this.
2503940	2508940	And I think it probably wants to get Harvey off it at this stage.
2509940	2516940	It's basically got to bring up one of its pincers and try to gut you with it. What are you doing when it does this?
2517940	2523940	Harvey wants to hit this thing in the squishy part of its head that we've seen pulsating. He wants to try and hit it there.
2523940	2526940	So whatever maneuver I can make to do that.
2526940	2530940	That's just a straight fighting brawl roll. Cool.
2530940	2537940	I'm going to throw up. It's an 85 on an 80.
2537940	2539940	Do you have five luck?
2539940	2540940	I do have five luck.
2540940	2547940	But you'd need to get a hard success, because I got an ordinary success on its attack versus you, and you're fighting back here.
2547940	2552940	So, yeah, you'd need to have a result of 40 here.
2552940	2553940	Ouch!
2553940	2555940	Yeah, that's not happening.
2555940	2557940	Would I roll an 85?
2558940	2559940	45 luck?
2559940	2560940	I've got 41.
2563940	2567940	On the price side, it's obviously a bit...
2567940	2575940	Oh, oh, wait! Hang on. One of my special talents is called Rapid Attack, and I can spend 10 luck to gain an extra melee attack.
2575940	2576940	Yeah.
2576940	2578940	Go for it. Go for it.
2578940	2579940	Awesome.
2584940	2586940	But you can spend luck on this one.
2586940	2588940	Okay, yeah. That's an 81.
2588940	2592940	This is a follow-up attack, which I'll deal with in a moment.
2592940	2598940	But on your first attack there, you did take three damage as it sunk its claws into you.
2598940	2604940	But then you're punching it right back. It's still trying to gut you, so it's fighting back.
2604940	2607940	So it needs a hard success here.
2607940	2610940	And it's only got an ordinary one, so this time you are hurting it.
2610940	2611940	Nice!
2611940	2612940	Hell yeah!
2612940	2614940	So give me a damage roll on that.
2614940	2616940	That would be a d3 plus your damage bonus.
2616940	2618940	d3, you're just half a d6, is that how you do it?
2618940	2619940	Yeah.
2619940	2623940	That's a 2, but my damage bonus is a d6.
2623940	2624940	Ah, that's good.
2624940	2625940	That's a 5.
2625940	2626940	So 7.
2626940	2627940	7.
2627940	2631940	Okay, I better make a con roll for it.
2633940	2638940	You punch it in the squidgy part of its head, and yeah, it goes limp.
2638940	2639940	Oh, hell yeah.
2639940	2640940	Oh.
2641940	2643940	Well done, Avi.
2643940	2648940	While this is going on, the other two had both of you over with all the equipment?
2648940	2651940	Yeah, I was over with Dark.
2651940	2657940	And Reverend Nye has come over as well, and he looks out the window at this stage,
2657940	2664940	and through the snow sees just the burning remains of the tower out there.
2664940	2671940	And he just stops for a moment, staring at this thing.
2672940	2678940	There was the heat haze of anger around him before, but it seems to have gone up a few hundred degrees.
2678940	2683940	And you can just feel the stage shaking underneath him.
2683940	2685940	Did you need that?
2689940	2692940	What happened to the tower?
2692940	2695940	Oh, yeah, that's crazy.
2695940	2697940	No one knows who could have done this.
2698940	2702940	We're all looking for who's burned down the tower.
2703940	2706940	It must be those monsters that did it.
2706940	2709940	Do you want to give me a fast talk roll like your life depends on it?
2710940	2711940	Yeah.
2713940	2717940	I got a 64, but I have a 60, so I'm going to spend 4 luck and pass.
2717940	2718940	Okay.
2718940	2723940	And so there is a brief moment of hesitation.
2724940	2732940	And the temperature drops again by a few degrees, and he looks around and says,
2732940	2738940	I will find out who is responsible for this and I will destroy them.
2741940	2742940	Yeah.
2742940	2744940	Yeah. Would you like help?
2744940	2748940	No, he says, and turns and storms off the stage.
2748940	2750940	Wait, how does this thing work?
2750940	2752940	He ignores you and walks off.
2753940	2755940	How does this thing work?
2755940	2758940	Can I try to find an on button?
2758940	2760940	Luke, it doesn't anymore.
2760940	2762940	Oh, yeah, because of the tower.
2762940	2766940	Because literally the stuff you did, you were a part of it.
2766940	2768940	We smashed it up real good.
2770940	2776940	So while the Reverend Nye storms off the stage, I mean, he almost casually flicks his hand up
2776940	2780940	and another one of these things spirals and bounces off the ground.
2780940	2783940	This is one that's holding a camera type thing.
2783940	2790940	And as it bounces off the ground, this huge arc of electricity comes off it and shoots
2790940	2792940	over in your direction.
2792940	2795940	Can I have a group luck roll?
2795940	2798940	Whoever's got the lowest luck out of the four of you?
2798940	2799940	I have 4.
2803940	2804940	34.
2804940	2805940	Damn.
2806940	2807940	OK.
2807940	2811940	And with that, the arc of electricity hits the console.
2815940	2820940	And all of a sudden, there are explosions and sparks coming off it.
2820940	2823940	There's electricity now.
2823940	2828940	I mean, not just the arc of electricity, but the electricity within the console is sparking
2828940	2830940	your way now as well.
2831940	2836940	Just all this, you can feel your hair standing on end.
2836940	2840940	Yeah, the air itself seems to be electrified.
2840940	2842940	What are you doing?
2842940	2847940	Is that, did the camera thing, it's like dropped by the bug guy, right?
2847940	2848940	It is.
2848940	2852940	And yeah, it's basically just spinning around on the ground, sending out random sparks of
2852940	2854940	energy now.
2854940	2855940	Oh, OK.
2855940	2857940	I was going to grab it, but I don't think I'm going to grab it.
2857940	2860940	Well, I'm going to run after it and try to grab it.
2860940	2861940	OK.
2861940	2864940	And I'm going to go try to work this machine.
2864940	2869940	Yeah, my goal is to grab it and then direct it at the machine to give it even more juice.
2869940	2874940	And I'm going to be trying to press buttons that look like they do stuff.
2874940	2879940	And I'm well educated, so maybe I read about it in a book.
2881940	2884940	This new invention that it was just revealed.
2884940	2885940	Yeah.
2885940	2888940	Yeah, this hasn't quite made it into the books yet.
2888940	2890940	OK, fuck.
2890940	2891940	Right.
2891940	2892940	Sorry.
2892940	2896940	OK, so you're trying to get the machine working.
2896940	2902940	What's Lafayette doing now that the creature that you're flying around with seems to have
2902940	2903940	stopped fighting?
2903940	2908940	Well, if it stopped grappling me, I'm going to stop grappling it and try to bring Harvey
2908940	2912940	and I to a safe stop and we just kind of ditch the corpse, maybe try to drop it on another
2912940	2913940	one of these things.
2913940	2914940	OK.
2914940	2915940	Yeah.
2915940	2916940	Yeah.
2916940	2917940	You can do that easily enough.
2917940	2920940	You are in a target rich environment.
2920940	2925940	So, yeah, we bought one of the other ones with this thing's corpse and it's pretty funny
2925940	2928940	and we share a little chuckle about that.
2928940	2934940	And and then, yeah, I see them like futzing with this machine, which now seems to be on
2934940	2936940	fire and sparking with electricity.
2936940	2937940	Yeah.
2937940	2943940	Lafayette's eyes just get super wide and he's like, come, Harvey, we need it right away.
2943940	2952940	He lands right next to the machine and kind of pushes checkers out of the way and he starts
2952940	2955940	going away at it using computer use.
2955940	2958940	This would be electrical repair.
2958940	2961940	Well, then he uses electrical repair.
2961940	2962940	Yeah.
2962940	2963940	OK.
2963940	2967940	Before we do that, let's just deal with, was it Mr.
2967940	2974940	Soul who was going off to try to grab the electrical gun that was misfiring?
2974940	2979940	Yeah, doing a real hopscotch situation, trying to avoid the electrical bolts flying off this
2979940	2980940	thing.
2980940	2986940	OK, then give me a DODGE roll to see what you can get to it without getting shot in
2986940	2988940	the process.
2988940	2990940	54 on a 30.
2990940	2992940	So I'm going to spend 24 LUCK.
2992940	2993940	Oh, nice.
2993940	2994940	To succeed.
2994940	2995940	OK.
2995940	2997940	So I'm going to go from 39 down to 15.
2997940	2998940	Oh, OK.
2998940	3000940	That's what Scott likes to hear.
3000940	3006940	So, yeah, you've managed to leap over this arc of electricity just as he was about to
3006940	3010940	take your legs off and grab hold of this device.
3010940	3016940	It looks like, yes, it does have controls on it that are supposed to determine when
3016940	3017940	it discharges.
3017940	3020940	But on the other hand, this thing is very definitely damaged.
3020940	3022940	It's just shooting randomly.
3022940	3029940	Knowing that it's randomly shooting, I'm just focusing on hefting it, you know, and
3029940	3035940	making sure that it is facing not at anyone who's working on the machine, but basically
3035940	3040940	like at a wall until I can run over to the machine close enough to direct it into the
3040940	3044940	machine and not at any of my new friends who are over there.
3044940	3045940	OK, yeah.
3045940	3047940	Yeah, you can do that.
3047940	3050940	Yeah, I don't see any reason for a roll.
3050940	3056940	So you can just do that for a bit while the others try to get to grips with the malfunctioning
3056940	3057940	machine.
3057940	3062940	Now, just as Lafayette is getting to grips with it and trying to work out how to fix
3062940	3063940	this.
3063940	3066940	I mean, first of all, yeah, you can make that electrical repair roll to see whether you
3066940	3068940	can see how to fix this.
3068940	3073940	Twelve, which is, I believe, an extreme success.
3073940	3074940	OK.
3074940	3076940	So, yeah, I mean, you can see.
3076940	3083940	I mean, if you can just get inside the works and disconnect that red wire over there,
3083940	3088940	then you can at least stop any further damage or at least you can probably limit any
3088940	3091940	further damage while it's on fire.
3091940	3096940	I mean, it's going to be difficult saving the machine because of the fire, but that's
3096940	3097940	a separate problem.
3097940	3104940	But the problem is that as you reach in to do that, this shockwave of energy comes off
3104940	3111940	the machine and all of a sudden it's like the room gets turned upside down.
3111940	3115940	Oh, we could do cocaine off the ceiling.
3115940	3119940	His final trick was perfecting the anti-graviton.
3119940	3120940	Yeah.
3120940	3121940	Yeah.
3121940	3126940	I mean, as a mad scientist, yeah, clearly that's what's come to mind.
3126940	3127940	Yes.
3127940	3132940	This has managed to reverse the graviton pulse or some shit like that.
3132940	3133940	Yeah.
3133940	3136940	All of a sudden you are falling towards the ceiling fast.
3136940	3137940	Wow.
3137940	3138940	Wow.
3138940	3141940	So it was like yours, but cooler.
3141940	3146940	I wouldn't say that.
3146940	3152940	What I'd like off all four of you is a jump roll just to see whether you can land on the
3152940	3154940	ceiling without getting hurt.
3154940	3157940	Ouchie.
3157940	3158940	Oh, wait.
3158940	3161940	I pass a 10 on a 20.
3161940	3163940	An 0-1 on a 20.
3163940	3164940	He got an 0-1.
3164940	3165940	Oh, my God.
3165940	3166940	Bloody hell.
3166940	3167940	Yeah.
3167940	3170940	I mean, you were born to walk on ceilings.
3170940	3171940	Yes.
3171940	3174940	I failed a 67 on a 20.
3174940	3181940	I mean, for a start, you are going to take a big one hit point of damage as you land
3181940	3183940	awkwardly on the ceiling.
3183940	3188940	But I would also like a luck roll off Lafayette.
3188940	3190940	Oh, 36.
3190940	3192940	Oh, 36 on a 36.
3192940	3193940	Oh, baby.
3193940	3195940	The whole day.
3195940	3200940	So, yes, you managed to avoid damaging your jet pack in the process.
3200940	3204940	Thank God, Jetty.
3204940	3205940	Wow.
3205940	3210940	And, sorry, Mr. Soul failed as well, did he?
3210940	3211940	Yeah.
3211940	3214940	I could spend 10 luck, but I only have 15.
3214940	3216940	Yeah, you take five hit points of damage.
3216940	3219940	You land far more heavily on the ceiling.
3219940	3222940	And so this is quite a high ceilinged room.
3222940	3230940	So you are now 20 feet at least away from the burning machine that is right above you.
3230940	3232940	I mean, it's maddening.
3232940	3242940	You know which cable you could pull just to try to deactivate this, but it's way up there.
3243940	3248940	However, will you get to it?
3248940	3256940	Well, that might be a problem, Scott, for someone who doesn't have a jet pack.
3256940	3261940	One, two, three, take away the compliment because you look so fine that I really want to make you mine.
3261940	3262940	Okay, yeah.
3262940	3267940	So he jet packs up to there or gives it a go anyway.
3267940	3274940	I don't think I actually want a pilot role for this because you are basically just flying up a few feet.
3274940	3279940	It's not like you're being attacked at this stage, and it's not like you're fighting strong winds.
3279940	3283940	This is fairly basic stuff, so I don't think you need a role for this.
3283940	3287940	He nimbly maneuvers to the machine in his kick-ass jet pack.
3287940	3293940	Yeah, I mean, you've seen the wires that you can just rearrange to bypass the damage circuits.
3293940	3295940	What is your goal here?
3295940	3302940	Are you trying to restore this part of the machine to functionality, or are you trying to disable it?
3302940	3308940	I think I'm trying to disable it, but what can I gleam of this machine's function from messing around in its innards?
3308940	3311940	Give me an engineering role to understand it.
3311940	3313940	96 on a 90.
3313940	3318940	No, I'll spend six luck.
3318940	3319940	I'll spend six luck.
3319940	3327940	And so, yeah, looking at this, you're fairly certain that it's doing something absolutely amazing.
3327940	3332940	Something that an idiot like Morden should never have been able to figure out how to do.
3332940	3343940	It doesn't have a power source per se, that it seems to be somehow pulling ambient energy out of just the fabric of reality itself.
3345940	3348940	Whoa. Holy shit.
3348940	3352940	Simply to harvest energy or to power itself for some other end?
3352940	3364940	It does seem to be what you thought, that it seems to be a device that can broadcast electricity or at least transmit electricity through the air.
3364940	3369940	Give me an intelligence role as well, just to see whether you can work out something else there.
3372940	3374940	A pass, 64 on a 75.
3374940	3386940	Yeah, I mean, the other thing that might occur to you is this is also a bit similar to some of Tesla's weirder designs for death rays.
3386940	3390940	Can I tell, so is this thing like spitting out energy right now?
3390940	3392940	I mean, it isn't activated at the moment.
3392940	3398940	You've managed to restore functionality, so you could switch it all on if you wanted to.
3398940	3400940	Can I tell where the energy would come out?
3400940	3401940	Through the aerial.
3401940	3407940	Well, Harvey, we might be able to repurpose this. I shot this down, I guess, to the ceiling below.
3408940	3413940	Harvey, we might be able to repurpose this thing as, well, some sort of death ray.
3413940	3417940	But I'll need you up on the aerial, manning it like a turret gun.
3421940	3425940	Is the way that the ceiling, now that we're on the ceiling, do I have easier access to it now?
3425940	3427940	Because it was above the eaves of the window, right?
3427940	3434940	Yeah, you'd need to clamber down, or rather, clamber up to the window, up from your perspective.
3434940	3438940	So, yeah, you could jump up and pull yourself up to the window.
3438940	3439940	I want to try to do that, yeah.
3439940	3448940	There is this small matter of what happens when you get outside, whether what's happening with gravity is limited to this room or whether you might risk falling off into the sky.
3449940	3450940	I'm real excited to find out.
3450940	3456940	At the very least, his goal would be to grab onto the aerial outside there.
3456940	3457940	Okay.
3457940	3459940	So if he does end up falling into the sky.
3459940	3465940	I mean, you could smash your way through what's left of the window really easily. It's quite badly damaged already.
3465940	3469940	And then, yeah, if you want to try to grab hold of the aerial.
3469940	3477940	Can I, before I do that, can I take the pocket square out of my tuxedo pocket and just throw it out the window and see where it goes?
3477940	3478940	Ooh!
3478940	3479940	Oh, yeah.
3479940	3480940	Big brain!
3480940	3482940	Give me a luck roll.
3482940	3483940	Okay.
3486940	3488940	That's a fail, a 68 on a 30.
3488940	3492940	Okay, it floats up into the sky, or falls up into the sky.
3492940	3496940	Okay, with that knowledge, I'm going to more carefully grab onto the aerial.
3497940	3500940	Okay, with that knowledge, I'm going to more carefully still continue with the plan.
3500940	3504940	I want to be able to grab onto the antenna that's on the outside here.
3504940	3509940	I mean, outside, you can see that the cars have disappeared outside.
3509940	3516940	And you can just hear the despairing cries of a few people who've gone out the front door and have fallen up into the sky as well.
3516940	3518940	Holy shit!
3518940	3520940	This is amazing!
3520940	3522940	So cool!
3523940	3528940	But you're clambering out carefully, holding onto the aerial.
3528940	3531940	Are you trying to break it away from the ball?
3531940	3539940	I mean, I'm doing what Lafayette told me to do, which was to try and use it and man it like a turret, but I don't know...
3539940	3541940	Yeah, I mean, it's got a fixed mount on it.
3541940	3553940	In order to have the freedom of movement to use it like that, you'd probably have to break it away from the ball and move it around or hold it.
3553940	3555940	You seem like you're built to do that.
3555940	3560940	Am I able to hold onto the building and the antenna at the same time so that if I do break it free?
3560940	3563940	You could probably hook your legs around the window and hold on like that.
3563940	3568940	That's what I want to do. And then I want to try and break the antenna free of the building.
3568940	3576940	Then what I want is a combined strength and dex roll, so it's whichever one is lower out of the two that you're rolling against.
3576940	3579940	Okay, I'm rolling on my dex, which is at a 50.
3581940	3583940	And I got an 0-5.
3583940	3584940	Oh yeah!
3584940	3586940	It's an extreme success.
3586940	3593940	Okay, so yeah, you do. You manage to break this thing off the wall and you are hanging there by your ankles.
3593940	3603940	Feeling like you're upside down, even though you're looking up into the sky, there are plenty of these buzzing things around you.
3603940	3611940	What's Lafayette doing at this stage? You can see that Harvey is hanging on outside the window now. You can hear the crunching.
3611940	3613940	Once I broke it free, I'll yell in something like,
3613940	3614940	I got it, boss!
3614940	3621940	Yeah, Lafayette is floating up by the machine and he's nervously watching Harvey do all this.
3621940	3632940	And he says, alright now Harvey, well if my calculations are correct, this should act as sort of a death ray.
3632940	3634940	Here goes nothing!
3634940	3638940	And he flips the switch and turns the thing on.
3638940	3643940	So as this is happening, what is going on with our two cultists?
3644940	3652940	Checkers is just like, anytime one of those things flies near him, he's just like running away from it.
3652940	3657940	But he's kind of just like not really sure what to do and just trying to stay safe.
3657940	3660940	Okay, and how about Mr. Soul?
3660940	3670940	Dark Soul is aiming this camera gun lightning bolt shooter action guy at the bugs now that are like still flying around.
3671940	3678940	Yeah, this doesn't really fall under any weapon skill you might have. It's not a human weapon, so I'll give you the base chance, which is 20%.
3678940	3679940	Cool.
3682940	3683940	I rolled a 10.
3683940	3685940	Holy shit!
3685940	3690940	So yeah, you are just spraying electric death around this room.
3690940	3698940	I mean, every now and then when you set fire to a bit of wall or perhaps vaporize one of the serving staff.
3698940	3705940	But you are on the whole blasting away and killing more bugs than anything else.
3705940	3711940	I mean, it doesn't help that you can't choose when it fires. You're just pointing and moving it around and hoping.
3711940	3713940	Do you want to give me a luck roll?
3713940	3718940	He's just crying again. He's really confused on whether or not this is good.
3720940	3721940	25 on a 15.
3721940	3727940	As you're firing around, one of these stray bolts hits Reverend Eye.
3729940	3736940	He's in the process of just with one fist, smashing one of these insects into an absolute pulp.
3736940	3745940	And the bolt hits him almost immediately. His clothes are on fire, his hair is on fire, and he just turns around.
3746940	3755940	His face looks almost inhuman now with the black eyes and the twisted, contorted features.
3755940	3759940	And he almost seems to ignore the burning of his clothes.
3759940	3766940	And he marches across the ceiling towards you, his fists raised, murder in his black eyes.
3767940	3768940	What do you do?
3769940	3775940	I keep the camera trained on him, hoping for a shock to blast off soon.
3775940	3777940	As I'm crying, I just say,
3778940	3785940	I just don't think that you're going to believe that it was an accident and you're just too powerful.
3785940	3792940	And even though I could learn so much from you, sir, it's just hopefully gonna any second now blast off.
3793940	3797940	And he's getting closer and closer and the thing hasn't fired off yet. It hasn't fired off.
3797940	3801940	You just have to, please, sir, please.
3802940	3809940	And then just as he's about to catch up with you, just as he's about raising his fist ready to do to you what he's done to so many of these flying things,
3809940	3816940	the gun fires off again and shoots into him and you can see it just blasts a hole through his chest.
3817940	3818940	And he slumps to the ceiling.
3822940	3823940	Fuck yeah.
3824940	3826940	Okay, that one was all me.
3826940	3833940	Checkers sees this happening and like fires a shot into the dead body.
3834940	3837940	Okay, yeah, that probably finishes the job off.
3837940	3838940	Friend.
3839940	3840940	Master.
3840940	3843940	I think we're gonna be okay.
3843940	3851940	I sure hope so. It's all up to him and I point it at Harvey.
3851940	3852940	Segue.

3970940	3973940	because it's all happening, baby.
3981940	3988940	And with that, Lafayette flicks the switch and the death ray bursts into life.
3988940	3991940	Harvey was looking down the end of it to see if it was on.
3994940	3997940	I think it's totally Cicerad.
3999940	4007940	So, yeah, you can feel it sparking, bursting into life, and then this almighty arc of power just comes out.
4007940	4017940	It's only partly visible. It's less that you can see a bolt of light coming out of it and more that it seems to be setting the air around it on fire.
4017940	4018940	Holy shit.
4018940	4024940	And, you know, certainly wherever you point it, things seem to be exploding and catching into flames.
4024940	4030940	I'm aiming it as, I'm just kind of trying to get a feel for it, aiming at things outside the building that are flying around,
4030940	4033940	just trying to get my feel for the zapiness of it.
4033940	4040940	Yeah, I mean, it's pretty much a continuous beam, so if you're just swirling around, I mean, it is difficult to aim,
4040940	4043940	and, you know, these things are, you know, small and fast moving.
4043940	4052940	On the bright side, your view isn't obscured by snow anymore because the snow seems to be falling up rather than down, but...
4055940	4061940	Well, I'll tell you what, I'll give you a choice. If you've got a higher firearm skill than Dex, I'll let you use that instead.
4061940	4064940	I do have higher firearms for both handguns and rifles.
4064940	4067940	Okay. I say this comes under rifles.
4068940	4069940	That's a seven.
4069940	4070940	Okay.
4071940	4074940	Wow, dude. Wow.
4074940	4083940	So, I think, yeah, I mean, you are against all the odds, you know, wielding this thing with alarming accuracy,
4083940	4088940	and, I mean, you're not necessarily shooting every one of these creatures out of the sky,
4088940	4093940	but you've certainly shot enough of them that the others are fucking right off.
4093940	4095940	They do not want anything to do with this.
4095940	4096940	Holy shit.
4097940	4098940	Fuck yeah.
4098940	4099940	Well done, Harvey.
4100940	4101940	Good shooting, chap.
4101940	4103940	I turn around and look at you guys.
4103940	4105940	Oh, thanks, guys. Oh, shit.
4105940	4109940	Fucking half the second story of the house just, like, slides off.
4109940	4117940	And it sounds like Mr. Soul and Checkers are looking over, joining in all this excitement.
4117940	4121940	You probably don't notice the sound behind you at first,
4122940	4127940	but there is this deep, ominous rumbling sound coming from behind you.
4131940	4132940	What is it?
4133940	4141940	And as you look around, you can see Reverend Nye's body is thrashing on the ground
4141940	4148940	and splitting open and something, something is coming out of it.
4148940	4153940	There is this huge, blackish, red tentacle reaching out, pushing up through the floor.
4155940	4162940	This huge claw and another huge claw reaching out as if it's lifting itself up through the ruined remains of a body
4162940	4164940	that is far too small to contain it.
4165940	4166940	Harvey, quick.
4166940	4168940	Direct your fire on the beast.
4168940	4169940	Can I have sanity?
4171940	4173940	That's a hard fail on that one.
4173940	4174940	Pass.
4174940	4175940	Pass.
4175940	4176940	Oh, my God.
4176940	4177940	A hundred.
4177940	4178940	No.
4178940	4179940	A hundred.
4179940	4180940	No.
4180940	4182940	You guys are so dead.
4182940	4186940	So Harvey takes the maximum sand loss on this because this is a fumble.
4186940	4187940	Fuck.
4187940	4189940	So you lose 100 points of sand.
4191940	4192940	What?
4195940	4196940	Oh, my God.
4196940	4197940	Was it a D100?
4197940	4199940	So that puts me down to 33.
4199940	4200940	No, I'm just kidding.
4200940	4203940	This is a D10 D100 sand loss.
4204940	4212940	So let's roll, then, for Mr. Soul, who also failed, didn't he?
4212940	4213940	Is that right?
4213940	4214940	Yeah, I failed.
4214940	4215940	Oh, no, no, no.
4215940	4216940	Sorry, I succeeded.
4216940	4217940	I failed.
4217940	4219940	So Checkers loses 87 points of sand.
4222940	4223940	That puts me at three.
4224940	4226940	Wait, Frugal, you still had 90?
4226940	4227940	Yep.
4230940	4232940	Oh, you're a shell of a man.
4233940	4234940	Oh, man.
4234940	4239940	Yeah, I mean, you are at least indefinitely insane, but yeah, bloody hell.
4239940	4243940	And Mr. Soul loses 10 points of sand.
4245940	4249940	And yeah, can I have an INTELLIGENCE roll to see whether you go into a bat of madness?
4249940	4252940	61 on a 50.
4252940	4253940	That is a fail.
4253940	4256940	OK, so you are not going into a bat of madness, at least.
4256940	4257940	So that's something.
4257940	4260940	And then that just leaves Lafayette.
4260940	4263940	Lafayette loses 9 points of sand.
4263940	4266940	How much has Lafayette lost in total?
4266940	4267940	10 total.
4267940	4271940	OK, and you've got more than 50 sand, haven't you?
4271940	4272940	Yes.
4272940	4275940	OK, so yeah, then give me an INTELLIGENCE roll.
4279940	4280940	7.
4283940	4285940	So you are having a bat of madness as well.
4285940	4291940	So basically, the only one of you who's not in a bat of madness at the moment is Mr. Soul.
4292940	4305940	What's even worse than that is that the person with the death ray hanging outside the window is on zero sand as this huge monster is filling up the room.
4305940	4323940	I guess I'll leave it down to you guys as to whether you want to play this out in detail or just perhaps cut to a little summary of what horrible things happened to you as a result of this series of rolls.
4323940	4324940	Let's hear the summary.
4324940	4326940	I'm down for the summary.
4326940	4349940	I mean, I think between the fact that you now have a monstrous avatar of Nyarlathotep in your midst who is personally pissed off with each and every one of you and hoist them into little bits, and you have a lunatic with a death ray outside just firing wildly, I cannot see this situation ending well for any of you.
4352940	4354940	Well, we've faced worse odds.
4356940	4368940	I think I'll leave it up to each of you, I think, to describe how horribly this ends for you.
4369940	4372940	So let's go round one by one.
4373940	4376940	How do you think this ends for Checkers?
4377940	4395940	Checkers sees this coming out of the ground and then just, he's lost it pretty much, but he looks up at Harvey and just sees nothing in his eyes and like realizes like, oh, we are totally fucked.
4396940	4403940	He goes to like just shoot himself to end it, but he doesn't have any bullets left, so he just kind of lays down.
4403940	4409940	Lays down on the ceiling, waiting for death.
4413940	4419940	And he just kind of tosses the pamphlets around him and he's like, maybe whoever finds me will take over.
4423940	4425940	And how about Lafayette?
4425940	4428940	He couldn't spend 30 luck to get out of this, could he?
4429940	4430940	Yeah.
4430940	4431940	Wait, how much luck do you have?
4431940	4432940	30.
4432940	4433940	Oh, shit.
4434940	4445940	If you have that much luck left, yeah, let's come back to your last then as potentially the last survivor of the massacre on the mount, as I'm sure the press will call it later.
4446940	4449940	Then, OK, how about Harvey?
4449940	4456940	I mean, Harvey obviously is permanently insane, but that shouldn't stop you narrating a little ending for him.
4456940	4471940	Well, I mean, the thing that sent him into insanity is the tentacles coming out of the floor and it startled him so bad that he fumbles with the death ray and it just goes bobbling all around and it's taken out things and people and stuff he's not meaning to aim at.
4471940	4473940	And he's still insane.
4473940	4477940	So once he gets back control of it, he's trying to point it at the tentacle thing.
4477940	4483940	But maybe one of those errant blasts hit the machine that was powering it on.
4483940	4484940	Oh, yeah.
4484940	4487940	So I've got no juice to shoot at this thing.
4487940	4489940	And it's seeing me as the biggest threat right now.
4489940	4496940	I assume a tentacle comes out and just grabs a hold of me and does what tentacle things in Cthulhu do.
4497940	4501940	I'm imagining your dying words are pew, pew, pew.
4507940	4512940	And how about Mr. Soul as the only sane person at the moment?
4513940	4529940	Yeah, Dark Soul lets off one more of these camera lightning bolts into this fucking enormous creature beast that is making its way into our dimension here and realizing that it does absolutely fuck all.
4529940	4530940	Oh, no, no, it does.
4530940	4531940	It doesn't do fuck all.
4531940	4533940	It doesn't do fuck all.
4533940	4534940	It makes it angry.
4535940	4536940	Ah, yeah.
4537940	4544940	So once I get its attention and make it upset, then I realize, like, oh, I'm fucked.
4544940	4545940	This is over.
4545940	4550940	And so he crouches down at the side of Checkers.
4551940	4552940	Psychic attack him.
4554940	4556940	I'll see what I can do, boss.
4557940	4560940	And he turns back and psychic attack, psychic attack, psychic attack.
4561940	4568940	And he is thrusting his mind directly into this fucking creature, which the rule book says you can't do.
4569940	4573940	You can do is I mean, you absolutely thrust your mind into it.
4574940	4576940	Just don't get your mind back again afterwards.
4577940	4579940	Your mind is now its chew toy.
4580940	4582940	That's even worse than your body.
4582940	4592940	And then, yeah, that just leaves Lafayette.
4592940	4604940	So how, once the dust and the screaming and the death and the fire and the madness end, how does Lafayette survive all this?
4605940	4610940	Well, I don't think it has ended by the time he's long gone.
4610940	4615940	He sees all of his three companions for the evening just, like, meet horrible fates.
4616940	4621940	He's probably still floating by the controls when the machine gets, like, shot by Harvey.
4622940	4629940	And at that moment, he just, like, watches in horror as the beast reaches out a tentacle and consumes his man.
4630940	4633940	As he's watching the building just collapse down around him.
4634940	4635940	Or up.
4635940	4637940	Yeah, collapse up around him.
4638940	4649940	He just sees a hole, through some beams, and jetpacks out of there, spending his last luck to, you know, narrowly get by before the Indiana Jones door closes on him.
4650940	4651940	He jets away into the night.
4652940	4659940	And, you know, I think the device has been destroyed, so there's no way of undoing the gravitational reverse that it did.
4659940	4670940	And I ordinarily would ask you for a luck roll to see what the widespread effect of this is, but you don't have any luck.
4673940	4683940	So I think as Lafayette flies out over the dawn, over Vermont, you can just see this world that has been changed and reshaped.
4684940	4685940	Fucking cows and shit floating past me.
4685940	4688940	Everything that was loose has flown off into the sky.
4689940	4690940	You're gonna change the world.
4693940	4694940	You know?
4697940	4699940	And shall we leave it there?
4702940	4705940	As Lafayette's jetpack starts sputtering out of fuel.
4708940	4709940	That was incredible.
4710940	4711940	Wow!
4712940	4714940	Thank you so much, Scott. That was amazing.
4716940	4719940	Has anybody ever tried to use the death ray as a gun?
4720940	4723940	One group has, but they weren't very successful.
4724940	4728940	Certainly nowhere near as successful as Harvey was. That was fucking amazing.
4733940	4734940	Wow.
4735940	4736940	That was great.
4737940	4742940	Can I ask a question? If we hadn't fucked up the tower, what was the plan? That the beam would hit that tower and then do what?
4742940	4754940	Yeah. So the basic plan was that Cicero had built this device, not because he was a decent inventor. He was a really shit inventor, as you word out.
4755940	4768940	But he'd found this injured amigo at some stage and started, first of all, extorting it to create stuff for him, and then realized that he could just extract its cranial fluid, inject it into himself, and it would boost his own intelligence.
4769940	4771940	So he started coming up with weird shit like that.
4772940	4779940	So his plan was just simply to create a device to succeed where Tesla didn't, and wirelessly transmit electricity.
4780940	4797940	The tower was basically just a big lighthouse, and the idea was that he'd flick a switch and demonstrate to everyone that there weren't any power sources up in the tower, and yet that light would suddenly beam with an incredibly bright wattage.
4798940	4800940	But obviously it all went a bit wrong.
4800940	4805940	I was going to say, that's pretty mundane. That's pretty dope. That's pretty standard cool.
4806940	4820940	Yeah. I mean, unbeknownst to him, Nyarlathotep had taken an interest in his work and was encouraging him along, because with World War II and the offing, he decided that what would really help World War II would be if people had death rays.
4821940	4831940	And so he was really keen on getting Cicero's invention out there into the world, just in time to turn the battlefields into killing fields.
4832940	4838940	You kind of wrecked all that, but you did wipe out most of humanity, so you win some, you lose some.
4839940	4840940	Yeah, anyone who wasn't in a basement.
4841940	4844940	What was the deal with the preacher, the Reverend?
4844940	4858940	The Reverend was an avatar of Nyarlathotep. He was basically a human avatar of Nyarlathotep, who was there just, I mean, he was the one who was going around mind-controlling people just to try to make sure that they got the good word out to the world and bigged up Cicero's invention.
4859940	4860940	Gotcha. Incredible.
4861940	4861940	
4862940	4863940	Absolutely incredible.
4864940	4865940	Scott, you knocked it out of the park again for us.
4866940	4867940	Thank you so much, dude.
4868940	4868940

4958940	4959940	Oh, fuck.
4975940	4981940	I didn't know that the wind could sew
4982940	4987940	The tissue and faggot bone
4989940	4995940	You were hollow and you spoke to me
4997940	5002940	Hollow and you said
5004940	5010940	I thought you might be starving
5011940	5018940	So I gave you everything
5022940	5026940	Thorns and rocks and devil's claw
5027940	5031940	Briers and dried red clay
5031940	5035940	Crocus blossoms in February
5036940	5040940	And I live in May
5041940	5045940	Time between a mother's fingers
5046940	5049940	And spit off of a bridge
5051940	5054940	Restless legs at 3 p.m.
5055940	5058940	While waiting for a fix
5061940	5065940	And I live in May
5066940	5070940	Time between a mother's fingers
5071940	5075940	And spit off of a bridge
5076940	5080940	Restless legs at 3 p.m.
5081940	5086940	While waiting for a fix

5099940	5106940	So come back here and see what's left of me
5109940	5115940	Is this the wholesome girl you left in Missouri?
5117940	5122940	My voice is nothing now
5123940	5127940	But the howl of the wind
5128940	5131940	Come closer dear in my teeth
5132940	5135940	Better in my jaw
5137940	5144940	Come closer dear in my teeth
5144940	5149940	Better in my jaw
