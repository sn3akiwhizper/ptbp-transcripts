0	11000	Oh, children, children, gather round ye old grease pit, for it is time for Uncle Wolfie to tell you all his special secrets.
11000	25000	But first, remember, Uncle Wolfie is broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP whenever and wherever I am's best radio station.
25000	33000	Possibly the only one, depending on when and where I reside, dimensionally speaking, of course.
33000	40000	But no matter the dimension, I always love hearing from y'all on our special segment, Howlin' with Wolf.
40000	49000	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from At TD Underscore Beck, who tweeted about the show and tagged At Pretending Pod.
49000	56000	You can do that too if you want, right now, while I read this message even. Go on and do it.
56000	58000	But also, listen.
79000	91000	Now, what the fuck kind of wild-ass shit is this that you are writin' to me, Touchdown Beck? Some kind of Cold War-ass activation code bullshit?
91000	104000	I am the only one who will be activating anybody today, Touchdown Beck. And they shall know when it is time to rise to the howl of their wolf.
104000	111000	They answer my call gladly. And then, we feed.
111000	123000	If you want to write up something way better than what TD Underscore Beck just did for Uncle Wolfie to howl, go ahead and tag At Pretending Pod on them social media accounts.
123000	127000	Except Facebook, where it's pretending to be people.
127000	136000	Go on, now. I dare you to do better than your fellow PTBP fans with an excellent Howlin' with Wolf.
136000	147000	And while y'all are thinkin' up some good stuff, go on and give us that good stuff by writin' up a five-star review on those podcast apps.
147000	151000	It'll make Uncle Wolfie a happy big boy.
151000	157000	Some people say I got nothin' to lose. I say I got the news.
157000	170000	Last time, the captains of the crew, Sans Dr. Shark, followed Mitch Diggory, now in ceremonial crop-top hooded robe, to a clearing deeper in the island.
170000	177000	This clearing had more ditches filled with blood, and finally, an innermost circle moat filled with water.
177000	187000	At five points around this circular moat, shallow pools the size of coffins held a sort of collateral for each pirate crew.
187000	196000	Each ship left a mate here in one of these pools in exchange for an orator, who will be chanting on the back of each ship,
196000	211000	while releasing liquid from a special barrel's bunghole as the crews fight to be the first to complete a circle around this island that sits just northeast of Las Antigas Mayores.
211000	219000	And this weird, old money-havin' Diggory family was wearin' black crop-top hoodies.
219000	229000	Some folks can call them crudies. Some call them hop-tops. Personally, I'm a big fan of croupy-toodies.
229000	242000	Takin' us now to Wavy Adler, Mr. Spitz, Alabaster Al, and their orator Mitch Diggory, son of the croupy-tooty laden Diggory family,
242000	249000	as they head back to the death of a salesman to race around the island for a job opportunity.
249000	257000	It's R slash recruiting hell, and it's R.I. Peter with cruisin'.
272000	297000	ðŸŽµ
297000	299000	Yeah.
299000	303000	The guy said he read through Luke's Twitter feed and was like,
303000	309000	you'll be right at home. We've got a couple dirtbags working here.
309000	313000	And then I sent him a picture of my face on the Wheatus's guy's face and said,
313000	317000	I'm just a late 20s dirtbag baby. And then I tweeted it later.
317000	319000	Yeah, it was a good tweet.
319000	322000	Also, yeah, he's also an ordained minister.
322000	330000	I said, I can't believe I haven't seen you there when he sent me his Universal Life Church badge.
330000	333000	Let's talk about what you guys have to do to win this competition, huh?
333000	335000	You gotta make sure that bunghole keeps on flowin'.
335000	336000	That's right.
336000	339000	And the orator's words keep on spillin'.
339000	340000	That's right.
340000	341000	Anything else?
341000	347000	Noi interruptions.
347000	350000	Noice.
350000	351000	Noiled it.
351000	352000	And in order to-
352000	355000	Noiled it.
355000	356000	Noiled it.
356000	362000	In order to truly noil the whole thing, you have to be the first to complete your circle.
362000	363000	We noil.
363000	364000	A complete circle.
364000	367000	Yeah, it doesn't have to be a perfect circle. It just has to be a complete circle.
367000	371000	A perfect circle would be probably too hard of a task for a sailboat.
371000	376000	Boys, I think we're gonna be fighting a lot of fuckin' pirates this-
376000	377000	What time of day is it?
377000	378000	Day.
378000	380000	This day.
380000	382000	That's very irony.
382000	383000	Yeah.
383000	388000	We're gonna be fighting a lot of other pirates this day, and I am just glad to know that
388000	394000	we've got Dr. Shark here with us as I point to Jimmy.
394000	400000	And as I say that, I hand him one of- I've taken one of Dr. Shark's legs before they
400000	402000	put him in the pod.
402000	403000	One of his legs?
403000	405000	He's got two peg legs.
405000	407000	Oh, right.
407000	412000	Wow, the picture in your mind was so funny for a second.
412000	414000	You've been playing too much The Forest.
414000	422000	So we see Alabaster Al carrying this wooden peg leg from Dr. Shark as he's got his arm
422000	424000	tightly around Jimmy.
424000	430000	And I hand it over to the new Dr. Shark, because I didn't spy a weapon on him.
430000	431000	Nice.
431000	433000	And so now he's legged.
433000	436000	He's legged?
436000	437000	Well legged.
437000	443000	And what's Wavy Adler look like as he fucking jaunts like into battle?
443000	446000	Like you're heading out to sea right now.
446000	449000	Now we're on the tendy, heading back to the main ship.
449000	453000	He's excited because like one of the few- I mean he does a lot on the ship.
453000	456000	He's kind of the elder statesman of the ship that people kind of look to him for kind of
456000	458000	general things there.
458000	461000	But one of the things that he prides himself on is his navigation skills.
461000	464000	And so running a circle around this island is right up his alley.
464000	465000	He's got a spring in his step.
465000	471000	He's like pulling out his spyglass and making sure that it's all in order as he's walking along.
471000	476000	He's wiping the lens off on his tattered gross jacket, maybe even licking it,
476000	480000	making sure that it's all spit-shined up there at the front there.
480000	481000	Awesome.
481000	482000	And Mr. Spitz?
482000	487000	Mr. Spitz is trying to talk to Mitch like out of earshot of his mom,
487000	491000	which might not be too difficult over like the waves and shit,
491000	494000	and the splash of the oars and stuff as we're rowing up to the boat.
494000	495000	And he's like-
495000	496000	No, I think you're a good-looking man.
496000	501000	Well, I mean, but I want a perfect body. I want a perfect soul.
501000	502000	Yeah.
502000	504000	It's just, Mitch, you're so very special, Mitch.
504000	506000	I appreciate you saying that.
506000	509000	I'm just a creep. I'm a weirdo, Mitch.
509000	512000	You guys are my weirdos. We're gonna win.
512000	516000	Mitch, that's not what I was talking about, but I appreciate the compliment.
516000	518000	Yeah, no problem. What's up, man?
518000	523000	Listen, what exactly is the prize? We get a job, right?
523000	524000	What the hell are we doing here?
524000	526000	Yeah, what the hell are we doing here, Mitch?
526000	534000	Oh, yeah, no, it's a job that was gonna earn enough treasure to embarrass the queen.
534000	536000	Enough treasure to embarrass the queen.
536000	541000	Is that some kind of ironic like catch thing where like she will be embarrassed,
541000	543000	but we don't actually get any treasure?
543000	547000	No, I think that we'll all be splitting like an absolute fuck ton of treasure.
547000	549000	Which queen we're talking about here?
549000	552000	Uh, Elizabeth. No, that's not what I was-
552000	554000	No, she's been dead for-
554000	556000	God rest her soul!
556000	558000	The mom says.
558000	561000	Because it's June, that's right. Yes, June.
561000	563000	Right, so Mitch.
563000	564000	Oh, yeah, man.
564000	565000	What are we doing?
565000	569000	What sort of services are we providing to you, though? Like your family?
569000	573000	What does the bong hole test prove? And what's with your words?
573000	574000	Roll psychology.
574000	576000	Can I roll to help him?
576000	578000	Yeah, you can all roll psychology.
578000	579000	Oh.
579000	580000	Oh.
580000	582000	Tight, I fail. I only have a 10, but-
582000	586000	Oh my god. I only have 10 also, but I rolled a 69.
586000	587000	Oh!
587000	588000	Excellent.
588000	590000	You just butt in.
590000	593000	I don't know if he'd- Could Spitz use a praise?
593000	596000	He only looks at the world through like items of value.
596000	598000	Yeah, yeah, go ahead and roll a praise.
598000	599000	Uh, five.
599000	606000	These people have enough wealth to where you think if they're looking to compound their wealth,
606000	613000	they seem to have enough, but then again, the human condition wants more, so.
613000	615000	They're just like those Hammonds.
615000	622000	The process of that appraisal is Spitz very creepily sniffing at him.
622000	623000	Yeah.
623000	624000	And then like-
624000	625000	You're getting smells you've never smelled before.
625000	627000	And he rubs the fabric of the-
627000	630000	Oh, you're getting feels you never felt before.
630000	641000	And with a 69, Joe Wavy Adler has this feeling right down in his little pilot bullet.
641000	643000	Little pilot Barry.
643000	644000	Little pilot Barry.
644000	645000	Makes your little pirate bird twitch.
645000	649000	Pilot Barry actually won the first- that was the first pirate to win an Oscar.
649000	650000	Pilot Barry?
650000	652000	My pilot Barry's feeling weird.
653000	662000	You fully believe that Mitch and maybe even the mom believe that there is a treasure to
662000	665000	be had after this competition.
665000	674000	However, you get the sense that both of them have a steady, heavy amount of mistrust for
674000	679000	the father figure of the family, which is also the father of the family.
679000	680000	And his name was?
680000	681000	Mr. Diggory.
682000	684000	Wavy was the one that clocked that it was the Diggorys, right?
684000	685000	Yep.
685000	689000	Hey, aren't you guys- what was the name?
689000	690000	Diggory, right?
690000	691000	I remember you guys.
691000	693000	You guys used to be from the old days.
693000	696000	You guys have been gone for a while.
696000	698000	It's not us.
698000	699000	What?
699000	701000	It's Mitch Diggory and Doug Diggory.
701000	703000	Doug, it's you.
703000	704000	You talking to the mom?
704000	706000	Doug is the dad.
706000	708000	Or at least what I said his name is.
708000	710000	No, his name is definitely Doug.
710000	712000	You're 100% right.
714000	717000	We've been finding treasure.
717000	718000	Of course.
718000	721000	We had to make it look like we had disappeared.
721000	723000	We're finding treasure.
725000	728000	It takes time and you have to take yourself away from society.
728000	730000	Is that what Doug tells you?
730000	731000	Yes.
731000	732000	Doug.
733000	735000	Ah, that was pretty good.
735000	737000	He appraises that joke.
740000	741000	Noise.
744000	746000	Well, that's good to see her alive and well, I guess.
746000	747000	You found much treasure, yeah?
747000	749000	We know where it is.
749000	752000	We just don't have a crew that can attain it.
752000	753000	And that's what we're here for.
753000	755000	Now it's all coming together.
755000	757000	They want to buy the best crew.
757000	758000	And that's us.
758000	759000	That's us.
759000	761000	And I'm looking at-
763000	765000	Oh, it's our pirate cat.
766000	767000	Meow.
767000	775000	I'm looking at the quality of the fabric and the smell of the perfumes in our boy Mitch's hair.
775000	778000	If it's a treasure that would tempt even these richy riches.
778000	780000	Should we cut his hair off?
780000	784000	I mean, maybe he's like a nice souvenir keepsake, but only if he says so.
784000	788000	You just talked about how nice his hair smelled and I thought maybe I'd like to keep some.
788000	790000	Mr. Spence gets very jealous.
790000	794000	Mrs. Knife flies in and just-
795000	796000	Cut it off.
800000	803000	Al takes his Octo knife out, which is-
803000	804000	Wait, no, no, no. He doesn't.
805000	806000	No, the parrot just told me to.
806000	807000	He says, what a looker.
811000	812000	Yes.
812000	815000	What a looker. Cut it off.
817000	818000	Should we get that clean?
820000	825000	As soon as you say you want a lock of Mitch's hair, Spitz is giving you death eyes.
825000	831000	He's got his Octo knife out and he's just very precisely cutting, like shaving his head.
831000	832000	Mrs. Knife said it.
832000	834000	And like taking all of his hair.
834000	835000	What?
835000	836000	Yeah, Mrs. Knife.
836000	837000	We're on a boat with Keith.
840000	842000	More like worm fingers.
842000	844000	Yeah, it's definitely Mrs. Knife's fault, honestly.
845000	850000	He wasn't going to do it if he wasn't instructed to, but he heard somebody say-
850000	851000	Cut it off.
851000	852000	And so he did.
852000	856000	So he's shaving his head and as he's doing it, puts a little in his pocket, gives a little
856000	861000	bit to Mr. Spitz and hands a little bit over to Waverly as well.
861000	869000	Mr. Spitz takes it, but he is like seething in rage and he says, you destroyed something beautiful.
869000	870000	Waverly says-
870000	872000	Oh, no thanks. I'm full.
874000	875000	Mitch reaches out.
875000	878000	Can I actually have gaps of some of that?
878000	880000	Oh, of course. It's yours after all.
880000	885000	Mr. Spitz has wet some with his spit and is trying to pat it down on Mitch's hair.
888000	894000	You know the monks that just shave everything except the very top of their head?
894000	895000	You mean the opposite?
895000	896000	Yeah.
896000	901000	No, there's ones that do what you're thinking and then there's ones that do a mirror version of it.
901000	902000	Yeah?
902000	903000	Yeah.
903000	904000	That's cool.
904000	905000	And then they do like ponytails sometimes.
905000	906000	There's top knot monks.
906000	907000	Yeah.
907000	910000	But I'm imagining that just like with spit.
910000	911000	Top knot monks.
911000	913000	He's a top knot monk now.
913000	920000	And he says, do you guys have any mirrors on the death of a salesman?
920000	921000	Look around you.
921000	922000	The whole thing's a mirror.
922000	923000	So no.
923000	926000	Then I don't know what the fuck that means.
926000	932000	Al looks down into the ocean and sees his reflection in the ocean and points to it.
933000	935000	He sees himself with no hair.
935000	937000	He freaks the fuck out.
937000	939000	He's like, Oh God.
939000	940000	Oh, okay.
940000	941000	All right.
941000	944000	I guess I'll take a negative 20 for the rest of the day.
944000	945000	Oh fuck.
945000	947000	That's right boy.
947000	948000	You're not beautiful no more.
948000	950000	I guess I belong here now.
950000	951000	There's no mirrors aboard.
951000	952000	Don't worry.
952000	953000	Oh good.
953000	955000	We don't much like contemplating our parents.
955000	959000	Before we get on the death of a salesman, I think we're about to fight for our lives.
959000	964000	So I think some more paint is going to be apt at this point.
964000	969500	And he kind of wets his hands in the ocean, sticks his hands into his pockets, which have
969500	970500	gunpowder in them.
970500	977000	And he with like wet gunpowder on his hands, like puts it onto the now bald Mitch for some
977000	982500	like crazy looking war paint that successfully like adheres two or three blonde Charlie Brown
982500	992500	strands sticking up and some tears like flow down through the war paint gunpowder war paint.
992500	994500	It's actually fucking rad.
994500	999500	So for Mitch, he has gunpowder war paint with just like hands on like the side of his head,
999500	1001500	on his face and head.
1001500	1006500	For me, I do the same and just kind of do underneath the eyes, like football style.
1006500	1012000	Do you break one of your like massive boils on your face when you know the gunpowder rubs
1012000	1017000	into it and, but this is something Dr Shark has told them to do multiple times is rub
1017000	1019000	the gunpowder into his open wounds.
1019000	1025000	Um, I don't know if it helps or not, but Dr Shark definitely told you to and then, and
1025000	1027000	then he, he puts his hands back down.
1027000	1033000	He didn't, it was like a 20 style insult, rub gunpowder and you open wounds.
1033000	1037000	It was like, okay, thanks doc walks around totally gone.
1037000	1041000	Uh, and so then I like reapply the wet gunpowder and look at you guys.
1041000	1044000	I'm like seeing if kind of gauge in if you want any or not.
1044000	1045000	Oh no, thanks.
1045000	1046000	I'm full.
1046000	1053000	Um, Spitz is no longer angry and he's just like pouting and sad and he's like, I wanted
1053000	1055000	to do Mitch's war paint.
1055000	1061000	Uh, I hear, I hear you do that and I wash my, my hands off in the ocean.
1061000	1066000	Get them wet and I open up my pocket full of gunpowder so that you can get your hands
1066000	1070000	wet and do more war paint to yourself and to, to Mitch.
1070000	1071000	It's not the same.
1071000	1075000	And he said, all right, you guys go up on the ship and I'm going to take this Tindy
1075000	1077000	off to the other one.
1077000	1080000	The, uh, big dreadnought pirate.
1080000	1081000	Uh, what was his name?
1081000	1082000	Neckbeard.
1082000	1087000	So yeah, Mr Spitz kind of like looks at wavy and owl, uh, and they nodded each other and
1087000	1092000	they're like, well CS, it seems like you think you might be in charge of that, but over there,
1092000	1099000	but we're more of a pirate democracy and we've elected some captains of our own for
1099000	1100000	your ship.
1100000	1104000	Meet Mrs. Knife and a parrot swoops in.
1104000	1105000	Yeah.
1105000	1112000	And bows and a self congratulatory says, what a looker.
1112000	1120000	And then, uh, a Emperor Tamarin monkey with full mustache comes flinging across like the
1120000	1124000	side of the ship and lands directly in the Tindy.
1124000	1125000	Yeah.
1125000	1128000	And then the pirate lands on the monkey's shoulder.
1128000	1129000	The pirate?
1129000	1130000	That's what I said.
1130000	1131000	The pirate.
1131000	1134000	That was a horrible accent.
1134000	1138000	Mrs North is as much pirate as any of us.
1138000	1139000	Exactly.
1139000	1140000	She's a pirate parrot.
1140000	1146000	Jesus Christ, the Emperor Tamarin monkey full mustache comes swooping in into the Tindy
1146000	1149000	and then the parrot lands on his shoulder.
1149000	1150000	Moving on.
1150000	1158000	And with that, the mother diggery begins rowing off to the ship that is nearby in the distance.
1158000	1163000	Waverly kind of mutters to himself, 50 years on a ship and a parrot and a goddamn monkey
1163000	1169000	make captain for ideas.
1169000	1174000	It's just not supposed to party, Joe.
1174000	1175000	We're on the boat right now, right?
1175000	1178000	Would you like to play the monkey?
1179000	1186000	I was going to say, well, if Jesus, if, if Jesus Christ is off to, uh, off to, uh, yeah,
1186000	1191000	the new images of Jesus Christ and Mrs. Knife, they're, they're gonna run the other boat,
1191000	1192000	right?
1192000	1193000	Yeah.
1193000	1194000	Yeah.
1194000	1195000	Are we on the boat currently right now?
1195000	1198000	I'm going to go up here real quick and then we'll basically start with you guys like on
1198000	1199000	the boat.
1199000	1200000	Okay.
1200000	1201000	Description going.
1201000	1205000	Well, I, because I so heavily invested into the animal handling thing, I'm going to call
1205000	1213000	my other monkey up to, I mean, I think you could also just play the monkey that's on
1213000	1218000	the ship and if you haven't, so like what if it knows semaphore and you can signal to
1218000	1219000	it and shit.
1219000	1220000	That's pretty good.
1220000	1221000	Yes.
1221000	1224000	You don't string the flags up.
1224000	1226000	It's literally doing fucking hand semaphore.
1226000	1227000	Yeah.
1227000	1230000	The other monkey can help me do that.
1230000	1233000	They do it to each other.
1233000	1237500	I tried to teach them the actual way to do it and they couldn't learn it, but they have
1237500	1241000	their own kind of, yeah.
1241000	1244000	I'm like, he's telling them the right thing.
1244000	1245000	Yeah.
1245000	1248000	It's going to be so great when they betray us, but also, okay, I'm trying to think, I've
1248000	1249000	been running through my head.
1249000	1250000	Like what?
1250000	1252600	Jesus Christ is monkey number one.
1252600	1254200	What's the name of the other monkey?
1254200	1255200	Mary Magdalene.
1255200	1258040	See, I was thinking biblical, but I thought it would be funnier.
1258040	1262160	Maybe just to go, Larry, this is me monkeys.
1262160	1264160	Jesus Christ and shit monkey.
1264160	1266160	What's opposite of Jesus Christ?
1266160	1268160	Little devil.
1268160	1270160	Santa.
1270160	1273160	Dude, Jesus Christ and Santa Claus.
1273160	1274160	Are not opposites.
1274160	1283160	Well, but they're funny names for monkeys.
1283160	1289160	As Mrs. Diggory is rolling away, Edward spits, like leans over the railing and shouts, and
1289160	1298160	remember Mrs. Diggory, we've got your boy.
1298160	1304160	And you can see in the distance on this boat, even in the beautiful, beautiful sunlight
1304160	1313160	and daytime that it is out currently, clear blue water below this whole 10D sky above,
1313160	1315160	Mrs. Diggory shivers.
1316160	1321160	I really fucking want some chicken dinners.
1321160	1325160	Do you guys hit the deck of the death of a salesman?
1325160	1332160	I want you to tell me a little bit more about your ship and how it fares in battle.
1332160	1336160	It's got wings and it flies in the air.
1336160	1343160	Hey, I'd be not shit, but beast.
1343160	1349160	As soon as Al gets on deck, he wants to go back down kind of into his like little domain.
1349160	1355160	So he walks into the door on the ship and goes down into kind of the underbelly of the ship.
1355160	1363160	He's probably got like the front quarter of the ship underneath is his like little living area slash like laboratory.
1363160	1369160	And there's like gunpowder and different like, you know, kind of chemically looking stuff in there.
1369160	1370160	Doohickeys and gadgets.
1370160	1372160	Doohickeys, gadgets, all sorts of stuff.
1372160	1377160	Mostly it all looks like it's about to like a lighter goes off and the whole thing explodes.
1380160	1381160	I love that.
1381160	1385160	But he walks in and he's got, you know, his like meticulously made bed and everything.
1385160	1388160	And then he goes over into the corner and there's a cage.
1388160	1393160	One cage is empty and one cage has Emperor Tamarin monkey in it.
1393160	1394160	A clone?
1394160	1395160	No.
1395160	1401160	Well, you can see the cages are kind of like on top of each other and the top one says Jesus Christ.
1401160	1402160	Yeah.
1402160	1404160	And the other one says crowbar.
1404160	1407160	Okay. Awesome.
1407160	1409160	It's because he likes to primate.
1415160	1417160	And so he gets crowbar out.
1417160	1418160	He gets crowbar out.
1418160	1431160	He refills his pockets with gunpowder and he just kind of sits on the bed, takes a few deep breaths, kind of like gathers himself and then heads back up to the top.
1431160	1435160	Even though it's a pun name, I'm still imagining crowbar as way harder.
1435160	1438160	Like little monkey tattoos.
1438160	1441160	Got a monkey weight set in his little monkey cage.
1441160	1442160	Jesus Christ is live.
1442160	1444160	Crowbar is jacked.
1445160	1448160	Crowbar is, he's like four times as heavy.
1448160	1452160	So like when he's on my shoulder, it's like weighs me down.
1455160	1456160	He's like 50 pounds.
1461160	1463160	He's bit everyone on board.
1463160	1465160	It's like a ferocious toddler.
1465160	1470160	As you, as you bring him back up on, as you bring, yeah, they can rip your face off.
1470160	1475160	As you bring him back up the deck, like every single person on your crew is freaking out.
1475160	1480160	They're like, they never know if it's going to be a Jesus Christ day or a crowbar day.
1480160	1483160	Whispers, whispers, thread, like up the decks.
1483160	1485160	It's crowbar. Crowbar's coming.
1485160	1489160	There's a reason that there's a lock on crowbars cage and not on Jesus's cage.
1491160	1493160	The stone had been rolled away.
1493160	1495160	Until Jesus went off to captain another ship.
1495160	1497160	This is why we trusted Jesus to do it.
1497160	1499160	Jesus was a great monkey.
1499160	1501160	Jesus was a great monkey. He is a great monkey.
1501160	1503160	Crowbar's a great pirate.
1505160	1508160	I come back up onto the deck and I see Waverly.
1511160	1513160	Waverly's getting prepared for what we're doing.
1513160	1516160	So he's up there making sure that all the crew men are getting to their stations.
1516160	1518160	He's probably calling out. I don't know ship call outs.
1518160	1519160	Oh, just do one.
1519160	1523160	To sails. All hands to sails.
1523160	1524160	Awesome.
1524160	1527160	He's starting to scout where the starting line is with his spyglass.
1527160	1530160	And he's moving the steering wheel to try and get the rudder in place
1530160	1533160	to get us a good angle to make sure that when we get to the starting line
1533160	1537160	we've got a good starting shot to roll out on.
1537160	1540160	That sounds good. So we've got four ships total.
1540160	1542160	You're in control of two of them.
1542160	1549160	And then we have the ship known as the fancy pyromancy on the dam sea.
1549160	1551160	Nice work.
1551160	1554160	The powdered wig flag.
1554160	1559160	The cannon on the flag is wearing a powdered wig.
1559160	1564160	They are lined up very inside track on this race.
1564160	1570160	And then the port deserters, which is the Union Jack flag
1570160	1574160	with a bottle embroidered over the top of it.
1574160	1578160	The port deserters are much further away from the island.
1578160	1582160	They are betting on the speed of their ship.
1582160	1588160	And you know these ex-military guys have an incredibly fast ship.
1588160	1592160	So they're taking the outside track to try to avoid combat.
1592160	1595160	Finally, the Swingsing brothers.
1595160	1597160	Everything I said earlier was wrong.
1597160	1599160	There are actually five ships total.
1599160	1601160	That would make more sense for sure.
1601160	1606160	The other one is the music notes that are flinging themselves off of a ship on their flag.
1606160	1610160	They are known as the Swingsing brothers, Barney and Balaam.
1610160	1616160	And they are also lined up pretty close to the island.
1616160	1619160	Sort of close to the fancy pyromancy on the dam sea.
1619160	1622160	And so from inner to outer, what's the...
1622160	1625160	First would be fancy pyromancy on the dam sea.
1625160	1631160	Next, pretty close by within range is the Swingsing brothers, Barney and Balaam.
1631160	1634160	And then there's a lot of space.
1634160	1639160	Like multiple cannon ranges between them and the port deserters.
1639160	1640160	And where are we?
1640160	1641160	Where are you?
1641160	1643160	Yeah, that's what we're talking about right now.
1643160	1644160	Oh, okay.
1644160	1645160	He just laid out where the other ships are.
1645160	1648160	So we can decide now where do we want to put ourselves between which two ships.
1648160	1653160	I'm pretty confident in my ability to run this crews firing squad.
1653160	1655160	Firing squad? Not really.
1655160	1656160	I mean...
1656160	1658160	Offensive line. How about that?
1659160	1664160	I'll just be back here on the tight end.
1664160	1666160	Mitch says as he heads to the stern.
1666160	1669160	I think we start in the middle and we immediately start shooting.
1669160	1672160	By middle, do you want to be closer to the port deserters?
1672160	1674160	They're the ones who are kind of far outside now.
1674160	1678160	I think we should mob the weakest with our superior numbers.
1678160	1680160	Send them to the bottom of the sea.
1680160	1684160	I think we let the weak ones take care of each other and we go after the...
1684160	1687160	We know that those guys are going to be fast, so we take them down fast.
1687160	1690160	We don't know who's going to be fast, do we?
1690160	1694160	When I was describing the port deserters, I described their ship as, you know...
1694160	1696160	They're ex-military and they're very fast.
1696160	1698160	We know who's going to be fast, yes.
1698160	1703160	But I say let the strongest weaken themselves out.
1703160	1707160	We pick off the weak slim pickings, then we come up on the remainders.
1707160	1708160	Whoever's left.
1708160	1713160	Well, I think we let the losers take care of themselves and we fight our number one competition.
1713160	1717160	We also have the advantage of two ships, so we can have the neckbeard run interference anywhere we want.
1717160	1721160	That's always the advantage, but we can also mob any one ship.
1721160	1728160	I have complete and the utmost confidence in the ability of Jesus Christ to sink the weak ships.
1728160	1732160	I think we take after the Dusty Pirates or whatever they're called.
1732160	1735160	I imagine they're all quite Dusty Pirates.
1735160	1740160	I knew it was something to do with music notes, but I forgot what they were called.
1740160	1741160	The Dusty Pirates?
1741160	1742160	What are they called?
1742160	1743160	The Swing Sing Brothers?
1743160	1744160	That's what I said.
1744160	1746160	Yeah, the Dusty Pirates.
1746160	1747160	What?
1747160	1748160	What?
1748160	1752160	I don't know where Dusty came from, but that's what I was referring to, was the Sing Swing Brothers.
1752160	1754160	But what were you saying about the Swing Swing Brothers?
1754160	1758160	We should follow them and we should take them, because they're going to be the fastest.
1758160	1761160	No, it's the port deserters who are the fastest.
1761160	1763160	That's the deserters.
1763160	1764160	That's why I said Dusty.
1764160	1766160	Dusty Pirates.
1766160	1768160	Hey, I'm just here to shoot shit.
1769160	1770160	Right.
1770160	1771160	Right.
1771160	1776160	So why don't you tend to your guns and leave the strategy to Mr. Adler?
1776160	1783160	He leaves the strategy huddle to make sure that his guys are all ready to shoot on his command.
1783160	1790160	My vote was to have our sister ship now, the Neckbeards, take out some aggression there
1790160	1791160	on the port deserters.
1791160	1792160	They're the ones who are going to get the lead.
1792160	1796160	We don't want them to get the lead, because if they get the lead, they're going to keep the lead.
1796160	1802160	And then I think that, as far as we are concerned, maybe put ourselves kind of distant from the other two?
1802160	1807160	Well, the whole idea is to get there first, to make a circle first, right?
1807160	1809160	Which the port deserters are going to do if we don't stop them.
1809160	1811160	That's what I'm saying.
1811160	1818160	So we take care of them, and then Jesus and Miss Sword are going to take, Miss Knife, whatever the name is,
1818160	1822160	is going to take care of the ones that aren't our competition.
1822160	1829160	And then once we take care of the fast boys, we are the fast boys, and we just complete the race.
1829160	1834160	What of these fancy pants? How do we make of their capabilities?
1834160	1839160	I want to get out my spyglass and maybe do a spot hidden or an appraisal.
1839160	1840160	Yeah, I want to help with that.
1840160	1841160	Yeah, absolutely.
1841160	1847160	I'd like to spot hidden, but for what their offensive capabilities are.
1847160	1850160	I pass for sure. Let's see if I get a crit.
1850160	1851160	I do not.
1851160	1853160	We got a pass from Wavy Adler.
1853160	1855160	Pass for Edward Spitz.
1855160	1856160	I got a 44 and a 45.
1856160	1859160	Can we just blanket this, the other ships, not just the pyromancy?
1859160	1860160	Absolutely.
1860160	1863160	And we got a crit from Al.
1863160	1864160	Alabaster.
1864160	1873160	As you look at the ship Fancy Pyromancy on the Damned Sea, you see that their canons are massive, and they have lots of them.
1873160	1875160	This thing is weighed down.
1875160	1880160	It is not going to be particularly fast. That's why they've taken the inside track.
1880160	1886160	However, their canons fire at an absurdly long range given the length of their barrels.
1886160	1889160	We should put the neckbeards between them and us.
1889160	1897160	When you see the Port Deserters ship, you see that they are all just chilling and drinking on deck.
1897160	1905160	And they are already celebrating their victory with how deeply fast their ship is.
1905160	1913160	The Swingsing Brothers are already preparing for acrobatics and sword fighting.
1913160	1917160	They are getting fully in mode to engage.
1917160	1926160	They seem to be directing their rudder directly at Fancy Pyromancy on the Damned Sea to go directly toward them right at the top.
1926160	1933160	So we put the neckbeards between the Fancy Damned Sea's guns and our holes.
1933160	1938160	And we make, like you lot are saying, for the Port Deserters.
1938160	1939160	The Dusty Pirates?
1939160	1940160	No.
1940160	1941160	Port Deserters.
1941160	1943160	I'm going to keep calling them that.
1943160	1946160	You're going to be telling your men to shoot at the wrong things.
1947160	1950160	The Port Deserters were on the outside?
1950160	1952160	Yeah, and they're the fastest ship.
1952160	1954160	I really should have brought my whiteboard, that's my bad.
1954160	1955160	No, this is fine.
1955160	1959160	Gentlemen, I think both of our ideas have some merit here.
1959160	1962160	We put the Port Deserters between us and...
1962160	1963160	Nope, they're on the outside.
1963160	1964160	Yes, exactly.
1964160	1965160	We can be even farther out.
1965160	1966160	Oh, we can be farther out than them?
1966160	1967160	We're on their outside.
1967160	1971160	And then between us and those scary guns, the neckbeards are there too.
1971160	1972160	Agreed.
1972160	1979160	Us, Deserters, neckbeards, Swinksing Bros, Fancy Pyromancy on the Damson.
1979160	1983160	I think we should take both of our boats after the Port Deserters.
1983160	1984160	Can we talk about our ship a little bit?
1984160	1988160	How do we feel about compared to these other boats, our speed?
1988160	1989160	Let's just say that.
1989160	1993160	How do we feel compared to these other boats as far as our speed compares to their speeds?
1993160	1996160	I would say, what's your rope use score?
1996160	2001160	I gave myself, in Kala Cthulhu, or Pulp Cthulhu, it's drive wagon slash coach.
2001160	2005160	I just crossed that out and called it ship and said 70.
2005160	2006160	Oh, okay.
2006160	2007160	Then we'll use that 70.
2007160	2015160	So you would consider yourself 10% slower than the fastest ship and 10% faster than
2015160	2020160	the next slowest, but then quite a bit faster than Fancy Pyromancy on the Damson.
2020160	2021160	Right, right, right, right.
2021160	2024160	The reason I brought that up is just to think about that inside track that the fancy is
2024160	2026160	using, if we wanted to get closer like that.
2026160	2030160	But with just being 10% behind Port Deserters, yeah, I don't think it matters.
2030160	2032160	You guys have a fast crew, a fast ship.
2032160	2033160	Yeah.
2033160	2038160	Would you call the Fancy Pyromancy, if you had to like rate maybe what like their cannons
2038160	2039160	and stuff were?
2039160	2042160	A hundred, the way it sounded.
2042160	2043160	Yeah, you got it.
2043160	2045160	Yeah, I think that's a good idea then.
2045160	2047160	If you want to put us on the outside of the deserters.
2047160	2048160	Mob the deserters.
2048160	2052160	And if it seems like any of the others are, you know, maybe pulling away from their scuff
2052160	2054160	while we send the neckbeards after them.
2054160	2055160	Look at it.
2055160	2056160	Look at it.
2056160	2057160	Look at the Sling Sling brothers.
2057160	2058160	Look at their rudder.
2058160	2059160	That's pointed right at the pyromancers.
2059160	2063160	They've been pyromancies in some fancy business for a little while.
2063160	2064160	Exactly.
2064160	2066160	I think the guys on the inside are going to take care of themselves.
2066160	2070160	And then they'll at least keep each other busy and we can deal with the deserters.
2070160	2075160	The smoke signal from the middle of the island changes from black to a white smoke.
2075160	2076160	Oh fuck.
2076160	2077160	Go, go, go.
2077160	2078160	As if a poop has been chosen.
2078160	2080160	Foesail, catch the wind.
2080160	2086160	Al runs down into the basement so he can light the pirate light, which helps with all the
2086160	2088160	lights on the ship.
2089160	2092160	And gives a boost to Joe's pilot score.
2092160	2095160	No, the pirate light.
2095160	2097160	His pirate score, yeah.
2097160	2098160	I said pirate score.
2098160	2100160	We all said pirate.
2102160	2105160	Spitz is kind of doing what he's been doing this whole time, which is just like sending
2105160	2106160	people to the right place.
2106160	2111160	But he's also not quite as effective as he might be in this case because even though
2111160	2117160	our ship does not have a captain, he makes sure no one goes near the captain's cabin.
2118160	2123160	It's unoccupied but he's like, it won't always be that way.
2123160	2127160	He just really, his only desire is to serve a hierarchy.
2130160	2132160	Oh then I should have given you a captain, my bad.
2132160	2134160	No, that's my character arc.
2134160	2136160	He's going to find his captain.
2136160	2142160	Al runs back up from lighting the pirate light and he starts yelling at everybody like,
2142160	2143160	Man the cannons!
2143160	2145160	Are we close enough to hit them?
2145160	2146160	Al!
2146160	2147160	Alabaster!
2147160	2149160	Signal to the backbears!
2149160	2151160	They need to open fire too!
2151160	2152160	Crowbar!
2152160	2157160	Crowbar runs up the mast pretty slowly because of the density that he's carrying up there.
2157160	2162160	It's like watching a giant move where it's like moving a lot but slowly.
2162160	2170160	And eventually like fucking Yadier Molina trying to steal second this...
2170160	2171160	You mean super duper fast?
2171160	2172160	That's cool.
2172160	2177160	This chonker knows exactly how to do what it's doing.
2177160	2182160	Like Albert Pujols moving into second on Fielder's Indifference.
2182160	2183160	That's right.
2183160	2191160	And so the monkey crowbar changes out a green flag for a red flag with a white stripe in it.
2191160	2194160	Which is the signal to the other ship.
2194160	2200160	And you see in the distance Jesus Christ throws up the affirming flag on the ship of Neckbeard.
2200160	2206160	And so I need a sailing roll from Mr. Wavey Adler.
2206160	2211160	That's a pass with a nine.
2211160	2212160	Okay.
2212160	2213160	Pass with an eight.
2213160	2214160	Oh!
2214160	2215160	Fuck yeah!
2215160	2216160	Slightly better jump.
2216160	2217160	Damn.
2217160	2218160	Oh no!
2218160	2219160	We get it.
2219160	2220160	We get it.
2220160	2221160	We're above in the contest.
2221160	2223160	The port deserters were drinking so our cannon fire startles them.
2223160	2224160	Oh fuck!
2224160	2228160	That and then also just yeah like they're over fucking confident.
2228160	2229160	They're cocky.
2229160	2233160	Because I noticed them like drinking on board and kind of spilling all over the place I've
2233160	2240160	loaded up a couple of the cannons with just like molotov kind of cannon balls to make
2240160	2241160	fire.
2241160	2242160	Should we?
2242160	2246160	I guess we could even do this now in podcast time or we could cut back but we didn't talk
2246160	2249160	about how we set up our orator and the barrel in the back.
2249160	2251160	Oh yeah let's do that.
2251160	2253160	We'll have to have a little talk with Mitch before.
2253160	2258160	Mitch takes the barrel and heaves it kind of rolls it over each side as he makes his
2258160	2262160	way back to the stern of the death of a salesman.
2262160	2268160	As he hits the stairs going up to that back deck he kind of looks around for anyone's
2268160	2269160	help.
2269160	2270160	Oh Mitch Mitch!
2270160	2271160	Mitch!
2271160	2273160	It's me Mr. Spitz.
2273160	2276160	Oh hey Mr. Spitz.
2276160	2280160	Can you help me carry this barrel back to the stern and get it ready?
2280160	2281160	Yeah yeah of course.
2281160	2283160	Anything for you my boy.
2283160	2286160	Oh man you're so nice to me.
2286160	2287160	I'm really worried.
2287160	2288160	Alright.
2288160	2293160	He begins helping you kind of carry it back there and you guys get it to the back and
2293160	2297160	kind of get it ready and set up the bunghole to be perfectly.
2297160	2301160	I've got a Marlin's bike ready to drive into that the second the smoke goes off but he
2301160	2305160	turns around and he pauses like Mitch why are you worried?
2305160	2316160	I'm just I think that um it's a lot of like I don't know do you do you believe in magic?
2316160	2317160	I do.
2317160	2323160	He like parts his vest to reveal all manner of like superstitious charms like crucifixes
2323160	2328160	just everything any anything he might imagine would bring him some luck in his pirate life
2328160	2333160	and he's like of course I do Mitch all pirates believe in magic and he gets a twinkle in
2333160	2340160	the side.
2340160	2346160	At that point Al walks out with like a giant length of rope and is like looking around
2346160	2348160	for something to tie him to.
2348160	2353160	Were these tattoos on your chest or were they trinkets that you had like a neck on necklaces?
2353160	2360160	Oh there's there's trinkets there's tattoos there's essential scars nice yeah essential
2360160	2365160	yeah no he's got some crystals and essential oils dangling down from there he's got a he's
2365160	2369160	got a Himalaya salt crystal lamp in his wig.
2369160	2373160	He's got Billy Bob Thornton's blood in a vial.
2373160	2381160	I just think that um yeah no that's good that's really that's really good Mr. Spitz.
2381160	2387160	Hold on one moment Mitch and he collects some crystals that he was charging on the railing.
2387160	2394160	If all moonlight's not you understand.
2394160	2401160	He looks back and he's just like I really um yeah no I think that'll be uh I think that'll
2401160	2407160	be helpful for you you know uh just keeping your keeping your head on your shoulders keep
2407160	2416160	your marbles you know all right okay um am I gonna fall back am I gonna fall off this
2416160	2417160	thing back here?
2417160	2419160	Mitch have you ever been on a boat?
2419160	2420160	Yeah I got here on a boat.
2420160	2421160	You know how to stand?
2421160	2423160	Yeah yeah I've been standing for a while yeah.
2423160	2428160	Al comes out with some rope and he's like oh could you stand maybe right up against
2428160	2430160	that pole right next to you?
2430160	2434160	Wait wait wait no no no give him some length you know we want him to.
2434160	2436160	We don't want him falling off this boat.
2436160	2439160	That's why you give him some length you fool.
2439160	2445160	This pirate balls are about to be throwing that's what we call cannon balls.
2445160	2448160	Pirate balls, pirate balls gonna be flowing.
2448160	2452160	We want Mitch to be able to dart from side to side but still.
2452160	2453160	From side to side.
2453160	2457160	When Al came out with the rope his intention was to just like completely secure him to
2457160	2465160	a pole but he's been convinced otherwise so uh he he he ties the rope kind of like like
2465160	2470160	in a harness around his like arms and gives him about 10 feet of rope but like enough
2470160	2476160	that if he fell off like only half of his body would be off the ship like he wouldn't
2476160	2478160	fall very far falling off.
2478160	2482160	I think now is the perfect time for the smoke to change yeah?
2482160	2483160	Yeah.
2483160	2484160	Smoke to go off.
2484160	2487160	Luke go ahead and roll a heavy what is your skill called?
2487160	2491160	It's called uh heavy weapons and I got a 48 on an 80.
2491160	2495160	Hey that'll do it okay cool uh go ahead and roll a d8.
2500160	2503160	Luke just signaled uh four fingers to Zach.
2503160	2507160	And Zach moved his head toward Luke's microphone.
2508160	2518160	Alright cool so um Thomas as the ship lurches forward the sails are filled.
2518160	2525160	Every single one of these massive pieces of cloth is taut in the in the heavy wind of
2525160	2531160	this summer day and it just pushes you forward and it's almost as if you like.
2531160	2535160	It's like the wind's blowing so hard that it's like crazy.
2536160	2541160	The ship lurches forward and in that moment as we begin you know what you must do.
2541160	2546160	Yeah Edward Spitz takes a very practiced hand to his mallet you know in the marlots bike
2546160	2552160	and busts open the bunghole and lets that liquid spray out the back.
2552160	2557160	And immediately the smell of iron hits your nose as blood begins pouring out the back
2557160	2566160	of the ship and your cannons go firing off and you see the port deserters head off to
2566160	2568160	a start just about even with you.
2568160	2573160	You're dead neck and neck and your cannons are firing through the whole of their ship
2573160	2581160	and on the other side you see that neckbeard ship unfortunately has not gotten the sails
2581160	2583160	up and ready to go yet.
2583160	2585160	They have not caught wind.
2585160	2588160	However the swing singers are off to a decent start.
2588160	2594160	The fancy pyromancy on the DMC lurches like they got a fucking Mario Kart boost because
2594160	2601160	they rolled a critical success and they jump to an early lead on the inside track as their
2601160	2613160	cannons sink us and end the game.
2616160	2623160	You see wood splinters flying off the ship of the swing sing brothers and you notice
2623160	2626160	that a couple of them who are up in the air.
2626160	2627160	What are they called?
2627160	2628160	What is a wooden part called?
2628160	2629160	A mast.
2629160	2630160	A mast.
2630160	2635160	The mast that a couple of them are hanging from is just obliterated to the point to where
2635160	2643160	it flies off the deck into the water dragging to these acrobatic pirates down into the water
2643160	2644160	with it.
2644160	2645160	People are screaming.
2645160	2651160	Smoke is covering the entirety of the racing track.
2651160	2654160	Oh isn't it a beautiful day Mitch?
2654160	2657160	Oh yeah it's pretty nice out actually today.
2657160	2659160	I'm at the blood and screams.
2659160	2663160	Oh yeah and he throws up.
2666160	2671160	Alabaster throws up for the second time today after seeing that.
2672160	2674160	Alright alright get your stomach in order boys.
2674160	2676160	It's time to start using your words.
2676160	2678160	I don't like using my words.
2678160	2680160	I like using my guns.
2680160	2682160	Use those guns Alabaster.
2682160	2689160	As Mitch wipes his mouth he takes a few deep breaths and begins.
2689160	2693160	For a while in here.
2693160	2697160	For a while in here.
2697160	2701160	For a while in here.
2710160	2711160	Miss Knife.
2711160	2715160	We could also have Jesus Christ and Miss Knife team up to captain the ship.
2715160	2716160	That's right.
2716160	2718160	Who is Jesus Christ?
2718160	2720160	That's my monkey.
2723160	2724160	Excellent.
2724160	2727160	The new adventures of Jesus and Mrs. Knife.
2748160	2756160	Thanks for watching.
