0	4520	Hey, hey, hey, baby, baby.
4520	7560	It's your surrogate uncle bringing all the funk.
7560	11800	It's your big bad dad that is always so rad.
11800	14200	Your mother that loves to smother.
14200	17440	Your aunt that likes to use weird font.
17440	21160	I'm all that and more, never an eyesore.
21160	24440	It is I, Wolf the dog, and I am breaking through
24440	28440	all that mental fog to do what you ask.
28480	32160	To broadcast live from 694.2 PTBP,
32160	36200	my various family members and or babies.
36200	38160	Now, speaking of family,
38160	41480	we got a letter from someone very dear to us.
41480	44640	This edition of Howlin' with Wolf is from Taylor B,
44640	48000	who tagged that pretending pod over there on Twitter.
48000	52720	They write, howdy wolf, the dog, not wolf's dog, wolf.
52720	54800	Just wanted to drop a line and let you know
54800	56960	I've been greatly enjoying the radio show
56960	59920	you host every hour on the hour.
59920	61600	Been listening to it nonstop
61600	64280	since I discovered it several days ago.
64280	65960	Or was it weeks ago?
65960	67320	I don't know anymore.
67320	69720	I haven't turned the channel on my old radio
69720	73400	since I fixed it to 694.2 PTBP,
73400	76120	the only radio station my old box
76120	78240	even picks up anymore, I think.
78240	81120	Anyway, I wanted to just send you a friendly reminder
81120	83960	that Mark Zuckerberg is absolutely the worst.
83960	86360	However, I also wanted to remind you
86360	89400	he and his robot cronies are in charge of Instagram
89400	91240	as well as Facebook.
91240	92440	I mean, face foot.
92440	94320	I mean, ah, nevermind.
94320	95880	When you trust social media,
95880	98400	you're allowing your identity and your time
98400	101280	and your attention to be sold to the lowest bidder.
101280	103960	That's why I use my Twitter to pimp out cool shit
103960	105800	like pretending to be people.
105800	108640	You continue to haunt my dreams, wolfy boy.
108640	110200	Keep it up.
110200	113280	You only listen every hour on the hour?
113280	116320	What about between the hours?
116320	120600	What about the infinite space between all of time?
120600	122960	The only social media wolf likes
122960	125360	was Craigslist Miss Connections.
125360	127960	Lot of folks think they see me skulking around
127960	130960	in the dead of night rummaging through a dumpster of three.
130960	132760	Lot of folks might be right.
132760	135280	Remember, if you wanna write up something for your wolf
135280	137120	to have, tag us on the internet.
137120	139000	Fuck every billionaire.
139000	142600	Or write up a five-star review on Apple Podcasts.
142600	146040	All the links are in the show notes, my babies.
146040	149800	This here is part two of Scott Dorward's wretched
149800	153000	call a Cthulhu scenario bleak prospect,
153000	156360	run by another than the published author himself,
156360	158000	Scott Dorward.
158000	161080	Don't step back because we're pushing forward.
161080	162480	Clench your rucksack,
162480	165520	because we're all cornered by Grady Philip drug
165520	167680	with real life.
167680	172680	Life, surreal, in retrospect a dream.
173680	178680	Easy times, feel less than serene.
179760	184760	In the moment it's hard to count your blessings.
187120	192120	So we long for days gone past us.
193760	196920	Grief and strife,
196920	201920	but even that's real life.
202680	207680	Life.
207880	210760	Zach, will you make your bald head look like a cat again?
214760	216280	That's awesome.
216280	218880	It makes me think I'm like a Star Trek.
218880	220320	I'm a Star Trek.
220320	222320	So, I mean, okay, so something that, you know,
222320	225880	when you see like bald cats that have those big folds,
225880	228600	something I did not realize is that cats that have
228600	233120	darker stripes on their heads, which is a lot of cats,
233120	235160	they just follow the pass of that fold.
235160	236000	Oh, wow.
236000	239040	So all cats look fucking weird underneath their hair.
240480	242680	Oh, oh God.
242680	244160	Okay, well, I've got a tabby
244160	247400	and I'll never look at her the same way again now.
247400	249560	I know, I know.
251400	254560	Those are those weird like bald cat folds.
254560	255400	Oh, dear.
259600	262640	Dr. Coombs was feeling pretty good.
262640	267640	Yes, so yeah, what actually happens with Dr. Coombs
269400	274400	is mechanically you gain seven points of pow
277720	279640	and six points of luck.
279640	282280	God's number and the devil's number back to back.
283760	286200	All I'm hearing is that I need to spend some luck
286200	288320	before I step on one of these things.
288600	293600	But yes, you are at the same time very aware
296360	299880	that this thing is moving around inside your foot.
299880	303280	You can't really feel it, but at the same time,
303280	306320	you can, you know, you just know it's there.
306320	308480	Do I maintain a sense of fear from it?
308480	309320	Or does-
309320	310160	Well, it's up to you.
310160	311800	Is that okay with me?
311800	314680	When obviously you have a parasite
314680	316560	that has borrowed its way into your flesh.
316560	320760	So, I mean, that may not make you especially happy,
320760	324120	but on the flip side, you're feeling good.
324120	324960	You are a doctor,
324960	328760	so you might get to be more weary of it than most.
328760	331320	Yeah, if you don't want us to kill you
331320	333120	in the next 10 minutes of gameplay.
340560	342160	Doctor, where'd it go?
342160	345920	Guys, it's in, I think it's in my foot.
346320	347920	I can feel it.
347920	350080	I can feel it moving around in there.
351040	351920	It's a-
351920	353840	Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
353840	358760	It's not the worst thing though.
358760	359600	What?
360600	362280	What's fucking worse?
362280	365520	It doesn't feel bad.
365520	367120	It doesn't feel bad.
367120	367960	It doesn't-
368960	370880	You are glowing, you're glowing.
370880	372680	You're positively fucking radiant.
372680	375360	Coombes kind of like straightens his back
375680	377120	higher than it's been in a long time.
377120	378720	Maybe like Crix's neck.
379840	381280	It's a-
381280	382120	It doesn't-
382120	382960	More confident.
382960	383920	It feels good.
383920	384760	It feels good.
384760	385600	It feels good.
385600	386440	You look good.
386440	388120	Doc, I'm just gonna say it, you're sexy.
390680	392040	We've all been thinking it.
392040	394680	Yeah, he kind of jogs in place a little.
394680	397920	Yeah, this is better than I felt in years.
397920	400600	This is, but I gotta get it out right though.
400600	402880	That I got, I mean, it's a parasite, right?
402880	403720	It's like-
403720	404680	Yes, yeah.
404880	407680	Put your foot up on the table, we're gonna chop it off.
407680	410400	We're gonna chop up your foot for sure.
410400	411240	Oh, hold on.
411240	412880	Let me see if I can wriggle around in there,
412880	414040	like that thing could.
414040	416920	Maybe it's still just flesh mush.
416920	418640	I mean, but I, yeah.
418640	419920	I grab the doctor's foot
419920	421920	and see if I can stick my fingers inside.
421920	423400	You certainly can.
423400	425520	Yeah, once you find the right spot in there,
425520	429840	your fingers just sink into the warm,
429840	432240	soft embrace of his flesh.
432280	434000	Oh, oh no.
434000	437480	Oh, oh, doc, doc, yeah.
437480	439000	I'm in your foot now.
440000	441400	My fingers are in your foot.
441400	443160	Frederick Mellon I is jealous.
443160	446080	Does that cause me pain or is it just a thing?
446080	449880	It's just a thing, you barely feel it.
449880	451880	On the other hand, I think Thomas Dolan
451880	452960	needs to make a sand roll
452960	457040	because your finger is now deep within his foot.
457960	460080	That's a 15, he's fine with it.
462640	466120	It's just one of those things,
466120	470000	you know, life's been pretty kooky the last few years.
470000	472320	Why would I let this, you know,
472320	473720	of all things get me down?
473720	477360	So Freddie, pass me those tongs.
477360	478800	Yeah, you go.
478800	480560	All right, doc,
480560	483000	I'm gonna try to fish this thing out of you, all right?
483000	486000	Yeah, if you can't, that's okay.
486000	488920	If you can't find it, that's fine too.
488920	489840	All right, yeah.
490680	492880	So if I keep, like,
492880	496040	does my hand just keep slipping up in there
496040	497360	without resistance, like?
497360	498200	Yeah.
498200	500680	What is the physical limitation of what I can get in there?
500680	502360	Sooner or later, I'm,
502360	505200	yeah, sooner or later you hit the barrier
505200	507880	of the edge of his foot
507880	510120	and your finger doesn't come out the other side.
510120	514360	So, you know, you get most of your finger into his foot.
514360	517480	Do I feel the little, do I feel the thing in there?
517480	519240	You absolutely do.
519560	524160	And it is quite spiky and there's a sharp moment of pain
524160	528400	as you can feel his little teeth biting into your flesh.
529880	531640	Freddie, there's no time for the tongs
531640	535400	and I'm gonna gingerly holding onto, like, two spikes,
535400	538160	just try to whip it out.
538160	539000	Okay.
539000	540600	Well, it's even easier than that
540600	543000	because its teeth have sunk into you.
543000	544360	So as you pull your finger out,
544360	546280	it's just there clasped onto the edge
546280	548040	of your finger, wriggling.
548040	549960	Freddie, fucking step on it.
549960	551200	I don't care if you crush my finger,
551200	552560	you step on this motherfucker.
552560	554600	No, it went through his foot last time.
554600	555440	That's what we tried.
555440	556360	It's the same thing.
556360	557560	Right, okay.
558880	560040	We need another plan.
561240	562080	Frederick.
563880	565320	I didn't wanna do this.
565320	567120	And he just cocks the shotgun.
570240	571800	Hold on, hold on.
571800	572720	Who's got a lighter?
572720	573920	That's smarter.
575840	577360	I smoke, I've got a lighter.
577600	580440	Okay, yeah, you've got a Zippo lighter
580440	582520	with a little bit of fuel in it.
582520	584600	I flick it into the thing
584600	586720	and I put the flame to the bottom of it
586720	587640	and I see what happens.
587640	590440	Okay, yeah, I mean, it starts catching fire
590440	593560	and almost immediately drops off onto the ground,
593560	594800	screaming in pain.
594800	599720	There's a kind of purplish ooze coming out of it
599720	602160	as it's writhing on the ground in agony.
602160	604080	I'm gonna bring the lighter to the ground
604080	606880	and try to torch the rest of the thing,
607240	609840	keep the flame to it and try to dispose of it.
609840	611360	Doctor, do you have anything flammable
611360	613840	you could dump on to make the flame bigger
613840	615960	but not too big to burn down your shack here?
615960	617080	Bit of rubbing alcohol.
617080	618680	I don't, yeah, I don't think I wanna start a fire.
618680	620760	Maybe we just keep doing the Zippo for a minute
620760	621600	and see if we can.
621600	622420	No, let's make it bigger.
622420	626120	No, let's get it really, really burning in here.
626120	627840	No, it looks like it's working.
627840	631000	It looks like the creature's dying.
631000	633080	Sorry, I can't see, my glasses are broken.
633080	634480	Maybe it was made by Bic,
634520	639520	but it does not like the Zippo, the Zippo interaction, so.
639880	643640	Yeah, and certainly after a few seconds
643640	646520	or 30 seconds or whatever of burning this thing,
646520	649320	it is very much dead.
649320	651720	What does my finger look like where it bit me?
651720	654760	Like it's had a small chunk of flesh bitten out of it.
654760	657640	But no spreading necrosis or?
657640	659880	Just blood and pain.
659880	662560	Ghostly voice emanating from it.
662560	663400	Okay.
663400	664920	Blood and pain, blood and pain.
664920	666780	I think it's gonna be all right.
668780	673780	So fire helps, fire helps against these things.
675040	676680	So we get some oily rags
676680	678720	and throw them on these fucking eggs
678720	681120	before they hatch into critters
681120	685840	that can pass through the walls of off-feet and mason jaws.
685840	690280	Yeah, well, I guess we're gonna have to do something.
690280	691880	We can't leave these here if they hatch.
691920	694120	Like you said, they'd run amok in this place.
694120	696920	Doc, I got a feeling there might be a few more people
696920	699500	in this camp with these eggs in them you could study.
699500	702680	So why don't we just burn these ones we got right now?
702680	705440	Yeah, I think that's what we gotta do.
705440	707760	I can't take the risk of this getting out of here.
707760	709160	Yeah, I mean, it's fairly simple.
709160	712360	You can just put a bit of surgical spirit in there
712360	715680	and light that and destroy the eggs
715680	717880	and the one that's hatched really easily.
717880	719160	Perfect, that's what we'll do.
719460	722880	Then you dispose of your specimens quickly,
722880	725960	simply, and without catastrophe.
726800	728900	Scott, you just saw us do the only smart thing
728900	733900	we've ever done in our entire role-playing careers.
738760	740440	I just kept my mouth shut the whole time.
740440	742760	I was like, just don't say anything and they'll fix it.
742760	743700	It'll be okay.
745720	747800	So, now what?
747840	749800	We gotta keep our eye on the prize at this point.
749800	752280	We gotta get Billy and Esther back.
752280	755460	I think we should head over to Hiram's old place.
755460	757500	So, Grillies or Greenleys?
757500	758600	Greenleys.
758600	761200	Greenleys, let's set out boys.
761200	763200	So, do you think they've been taking us
763200	765040	and putting the eggs inside of us
765040	767280	and then they hatch and then they go into other people
767280	769200	and that's how it's spreading?
769200	771440	You said something about a sacrifice earlier,
771440	774700	but I was thinking that maybe they just take us
774700	778260	to put the eggs inside of us.
778260	781380	Did Nancy, Nancy said something about them.
781380	783540	Did she say taken, they were taken people?
783540	784540	Did she say that?
784540	786940	No, she just said something about a puppet singing.
786940	789560	Before that though, she talked about people without faces.
789560	790940	Oh, that's right.
790940	792000	Maybe they were in masks
792000	794420	that don't have any designs on them.
794420	798060	Why don't we just worry about one spooky thing at a time?
798060	799860	But what if the spooky things are connected?
799860	803140	How likely is it that the spooky things are?
803140	804740	Park the car and have a job.
804740	805880	I'm sure they are.
806780	808340	I'm sure they are connected,
808340	812420	but let's just, you know, let's go to Greenleys.
812420	814300	We'll find out, we'll see what's going on.
814300	815820	You're operating under the assumption though
815820	819140	that maybe there's more of these things there.
819140	820900	Is that what you're saying, Frederick?
820900	821740	Should we take something?
821740	822560	Oh yeah, I think they're growing them.
822560	823620	I think they're breeding them.
823620	825620	Should we take something fiery with us?
825620	828180	Something we can use if we run into them?
828180	829500	Well, definitely, yeah.
829500	831560	I mean, we should, what do we got?
831560	832400	What do we got?
832400	835040	Probably we don't have access to a flamethrower.
835040	837280	I don't know if that's been invented yet.
837280	838600	In the medical shack, I mean,
838600	840720	you do have a little bit of surgical spirits
840720	844000	that you use for disinfecting wounds.
844000	846560	I'm not a whole hell of a lot, but you got some.
846560	851160	And you've also got maybe a pint of paraffin left
851160	852320	that you use for the heater.
852320	854400	I'm gonna create little perfect,
854400	857160	little pocketable vials of flammable.
857160	861400	So mixing maybe the spirits and the paraffin if need be
861400	863520	and create like a little line of them
863520	865280	that I can hand out to the guys.
865280	868520	And then if we have lighters, each of us
868520	870920	or something like that, it's just, these are just like-
870920	872240	I pop one right behind my mouth
872240	873880	assuming it's a cyanide capsule.
877880	882880	I'm picturing them as like just little to-go fuel canisters.
883080	883920	Yeah.
883920	885160	Like you can pour them on something if you need to
885160	886240	to light it, but I don't think,
886240	888280	they're not like mini Molotovs, but like-
888280	890840	Glass vials of combustible.
891400	892240	Whatever.
892240	893080	Yep, okay.
893080	895000	It's definitely, it's awkward in his mouth.
897800	898840	But surprisingly tasty.
898840	900360	Dolan, drop it, drop it.
904440	905400	We all grab lighters
905400	910000	and I think we should head straight to Greenleys.
910000	910880	Okay.
910880	912640	Mr. Mellon, did you grab that shotgun?
912640	913480	Did that happen?
913480	914400	This one?
914400	916440	Oh yeah, I need to uncock it.
916440	918000	That's what it's called, right?
919120	919960	Depends on.
921040	922360	The kind of shotgun, I think.
922360	923400	It's this kind.
924960	927720	Yeah, it's a double barrel shotgun.
927720	928560	Yes.
928560	930240	So yeah, it's not a pump action one.
930240	933560	It's that kind, we say, pointing to what he's got.
933560	937400	Okay, it's kind of spooky, but let's go to Greenleys.
937400	939080	The back door was the idea, right?
939080	939920	Or the back window.
939920	940760	That's what Hiram said.
940760	943160	I'd say maybe even a mile before,
943160	946080	we're not gonna wanna be seen on the road heading there.
946080	947520	Or we're like a mile out, right?
947520	950200	Yeah, it's probably about 20 minutes walk
950400	951240	from where you are.
951240	953400	Maybe like a quarter mile.
953400	954600	We could get off the road.
954600	957480	I don't know why we gotta make it super hot on ourselves.
957480	958480	Anyway, let's head out.
958480	963480	Yeah, I mean, by this stage, it's probably early afternoon.
963480	968040	So you make your way up the road towards Greenleys.
968040	972200	And yeah, I mean, there are grounds to the house.
972200	976360	So you can make your way off the road earlier
976360	978640	than the driveway that goes up there
978840	982440	by perhaps forcing your way through a hedge.
982440	985280	And yeah, I mean, this is a fairly nice house.
985280	987800	It's got what you reckon are probably
987800	992040	several acres of ground, fairly well-tended.
992040	994040	The lawn's nicely manicured.
994040	995840	There's a few flower beds,
995840	998200	which obviously aren't in bloom at this time of year,
998200	1002240	but are still in good condition.
1002240	1004840	I bet those are really nice when they're in season.
1004840	1009840	Yeah, the house itself, it's a stone-built structure
1010040	1015040	in fair old size, probably no more than about 50 years old.
1016520	1018360	The thing that probably gets your attention
1018360	1021800	more than anything else is there are a number of cars
1021800	1023560	parked outside there.
1023560	1027400	It looks like Mr. Brink collects cars.
1027400	1030200	Can we get a sense of any activity from our vantage point?
1030200	1032080	Can we see maybe people in the windows
1032080	1034680	or if there's anybody working the grounds
1034680	1035840	or anything like that?
1035840	1037640	Sure, give me a spot hidden, Roll.
1041080	1043880	I failed a 57 on a 25.
1043880	1044720	Okay.
1044720	1046200	I rolled a 55 on a 55.
1046200	1049960	Yeah, certainly Freddy looking around
1049960	1054040	doesn't notice any gardeners or anything.
1054040	1057120	There don't seem to be any staff on site.
1057120	1062000	You can't really see any activity going onto the windows.
1062000	1064160	The place looks fairly quiet.
1064500	1065340	It looks good.
1065340	1066440	Do you wanna just move?
1066440	1069940	Hey guys, they should call him Mr. Cause, right?
1074360	1075480	They should call him Mr. Cause.
1075480	1077040	Does he come before an effect?
1077040	1079200	I'm confused, what are you talking about?
1079200	1080280	All the cause.
1081880	1084680	All his key, he's got a lot of, let's go to the back.
1091080	1092800	Did we see that big, Caddy?
1093640	1097720	Yeah, you do, there is a big black Cadillac
1097720	1099300	parked out the front.
1099300	1102580	Quiet, we gotta stay quiet as we're moving along
1102580	1105520	through the back, okay, because if anyone hears us
1105520	1107080	once we get within earshot,
1108000	1109920	they're not gonna take too kindly.
1109920	1113920	I'm afraid, you know, the face of a thief
1113920	1115960	is not one that people forget.
1115960	1117960	Fred, are you saying you hit this place before?
1117960	1119760	If the servants here are the same as they were
1119760	1121360	when Hiram was here, then, hmm.
1123440	1126720	Wait, okay, well, but Hiram, he didn't really,
1126720	1128760	he doesn't know you robbed this place, right?
1128760	1130840	He also said he didn't have servants,
1130840	1132680	so who were those people there that night?
1132680	1134820	I don't know, okay, moving on.
1139160	1141860	Nevermind, we're good, no one's gonna recognize me,
1141860	1144500	not trying to make it harder for ourselves, that'd be silly.
1144500	1146040	Let's sneak into the back now.
1147200	1148120	All right, yeah.
1148120	1152840	Okay, well, you make your way around
1152840	1156480	to the back of the house, and sure enough,
1156480	1160000	there is a little, a small little wing
1160000	1161040	coming off the back of the house
1161040	1164500	that looks like it is probably the servants' quarters,
1164500	1166480	whereas the rest of the house is on two stories,
1166480	1168940	this is a one-story structure just out the back.
1168940	1171800	Okay, now, are we gonna try to sneak into the house
1171800	1173480	and kinda get a feel of what's going on,
1173480	1175480	or are we going straight down to the cellar?
1175800	1178640	Play it by ear, and a little bit of column A,
1178640	1180120	a little bit of column B,
1180120	1181760	we gotta get through that door first, though.
1181760	1183480	Yeah, our goal is to get through that,
1183480	1186240	it's the window that had the broken lock, right?
1186240	1188140	I think our goal should be the cellar,
1188140	1191320	but yeah, keeping an eye out on the lay of the house,
1191320	1192320	we're gonna have two kids,
1192320	1194260	we're dragging out with this, hopefully.
1194260	1196280	There's fucking dragons down there.
1196280	1197780	Fuckers call Cthulhu.
1201080	1202920	Dragons out!
1202960	1207600	Are you, what, just forcing the lock on the window?
1207600	1209840	Is your plan something else?
1209840	1212000	Yeah, I'm definitely gonna listen in
1212000	1216000	to try to look around through the window very stealthily
1216000	1218600	to get a lay to see if, obviously,
1218600	1220300	if there's someone right on the other side of the window,
1220300	1221800	I don't wanna try to break in.
1221800	1224060	Sure, you'd be able to see
1224060	1225600	if there was someone on the other side of the window,
1225600	1226880	there aren't any curtains up,
1226880	1229640	and looking in, there definitely isn't.
1229680	1233440	Then I'm gonna kinda cup my dirty,
1233440	1235880	my doidy hand around my ear,
1235880	1238400	and press it up against the glass,
1238400	1242420	and try to see if I can hear anything
1242420	1244800	going on inside the house.
1244800	1246100	Okay, give me a listen roll.
1246100	1247440	28 on a 50.
1248400	1252120	Yeah, you listen, and no,
1252120	1255740	you can't hear any activity at all.
1255740	1258760	It's dead silent inside.
1258760	1261960	So he's gonna go ahead and try to open up the window.
1261960	1265920	Well, I think you only need to give me a stealth roll here
1265920	1268120	because it's easy enough to force.
1268120	1271200	It's just a question of whether you can do so quietly.
1271200	1272560	43 on a 60.
1272560	1274840	I mean, sure enough, as per Hiram's words,
1274840	1276800	the lock on this is crap,
1276800	1279920	and so just with a bit of force, yeah, it cracks,
1279920	1284920	and you manage to avoid the noise of that being too loud,
1285560	1290480	and the window squeaking as you slide it up.
1290480	1291920	You have the window open,
1291920	1294280	and you can clamber inside should you wish.
1294280	1296360	Clamber indeed I do.
1296360	1297880	I'm gonna follow suit.
1297880	1300960	Frederick's kind of our guy who is breaky any,
1300960	1303640	and I trust that he has done his due diligence,
1303640	1305360	that this is an okay thing.
1305360	1308400	The coast is clear, so I just follow in his footsteps.
1308400	1310240	And as long as I don't hear anything
1310240	1313560	calamitous happen to them, I follow as well.
1313600	1314760	But I do pause for a moment
1314760	1317360	to make sure nothing calamitous happens to them.
1317360	1319560	If something calamitous is happening to them,
1319560	1321680	it's happening very quietly.
1321680	1323880	That's good enough for me to go on through.
1325000	1327800	Okay, then yeah, the three of you clambering
1327800	1330880	through this window, and the room inside
1330880	1333640	is just a fairly simple bedroom.
1333640	1336600	There's an unmade bed.
1336600	1338120	Sorry, when I say unmade bed,
1338120	1339560	there are no sheets or anything on there.
1339560	1341200	It's just a mattress on the frame.
1341240	1343800	There's a wardrobe and a chest of drawers,
1343800	1346280	fairly simple looking furniture.
1346280	1348480	The whole place just looks unlived in.
1348480	1352400	You fellas know how long Hiram's not been here,
1352400	1355440	how long it's been since his partner bought this place?
1355440	1357680	Just at the start of it, you know,
1357680	1359640	all the recent troubles.
1359640	1361840	Enough time to have moved in.
1361840	1363440	Maybe he doesn't have enough people
1363440	1366680	to fill all these big, big house rooms.
1366680	1369400	Yeah, it just looks like there's no servants living here.
1369400	1372280	I say we press on into the house very quietly.
1372280	1373120	Agreed.
1373120	1374720	Yeah, the door from this room
1374720	1376840	opens out into a small corridor.
1378080	1381160	Down to the left, there's obviously a back door
1381160	1383040	that comes in this way.
1383040	1384920	Heading towards the right,
1384920	1388680	it seems to go towards the main house.
1388680	1391160	And you can see that, yeah, there is a door
1391160	1393520	that opens up into,
1394720	1398160	certainly it looks like it opens up into the main building.
1398160	1402240	There's also, off to your left,
1402240	1405840	a flight of stairs that seems to go down.
1405840	1409360	You know, if we go down first,
1409360	1411720	then we don't have to go into the big house.
1411720	1413360	Settlers are usually down.
1413360	1414680	I think we should go down.
1414680	1418320	We get, that's the direction, right?
1418320	1421440	I can only think of traps and pitfalls
1421440	1422960	existing in the rest of the house,
1422960	1427040	but we would figure out more of the fun mystery, so.
1427080	1428240	But let's go down.
1428240	1429360	You go down the stairs,
1429360	1433000	and as you reach the bottom, it opens up,
1433000	1436120	unsurprisingly, into some fairly large cellars.
1436120	1437160	It looks like it's broken up
1437160	1438840	into a number of different rooms.
1438840	1440080	But it goes into, you know,
1440080	1442000	initially one fairly large room
1442000	1444240	that's got shelves lining the walls,
1444240	1445400	most of which are empty.
1445400	1447840	There's obviously some old supplies,
1447840	1449520	or, you know, some old cleaning supplies
1449520	1452120	and a few jars sitting on the shelves
1452120	1454960	that look like they've probably been there for a long time.
1454960	1456720	There's spiders' webs.
1457520	1459760	There's an electric light you can turn on
1459760	1461520	so you can see what you're doing.
1461520	1466280	The only thing that stands out as being unusual
1466280	1468560	or worthy of note in this room
1468560	1471760	is there's a table towards the back
1471760	1476760	that has a metal cylinder or case,
1476920	1480560	or, you know, it looks like a large jar
1480560	1482840	or, you know, some kind of canister,
1482840	1484800	metal canister sitting there.
1485640	1490640	And next to it, there's a pair of heavy leather gloves
1490680	1492640	and a set of forceps.
1498560	1501880	What do you think, Doc?
1501880	1506000	Well, it looks like there's something inside that canister
1506000	1509000	that needs leather gloves and forceps to be touched.
1509000	1511800	I don't know if I want to mess with that.
1511840	1516840	That usually means something's dangerous.
1517440	1520360	What if there was something in the canister,
1520360	1522000	something like what we've seen,
1523040	1525640	and that canister can hold it?
1525640	1528000	I think we need the canister and those gloves, yeah.
1528000	1530880	Yeah, I think 100% we should take it with us.
1530880	1532960	Seems like these dickheads down in the cellar
1532960	1534720	have found out the, you know,
1534720	1538240	the safe way to deal with these parasites, so.
1538240	1540000	Yeah, I think that's a good idea
1540000	1543280	that at the very least, if it is specimens,
1543280	1545760	that gives us another supply for me to test, yeah.
1545760	1547840	Yeah, I mean, the canister is,
1547840	1552320	I mean, it's about a foot in diameter.
1554080	1556440	Not that heavy, but as you pick it up,
1556440	1560080	you can feel liquid sloshing around inside.
1560080	1563640	If I shake it, can I feel anything other than liquid?
1563640	1565400	Can I feel anything hitting the sides?
1565400	1567200	Yeah, you can.
1567200	1569160	Yeah, there's definitely something suspended
1569160	1570000	in liquid in here.
1570000	1572520	But we can't see the liquid or anything in there, right?
1572520	1574440	It's a metal canister, no.
1574440	1575640	There's no glass in it.
1575640	1577800	I mean, it seems, you know,
1577800	1580800	maybe this is a thing for holding those fucking things.
1580800	1585040	If it's not, we got a cool canister, so.
1585040	1588840	I say that's what we put our money on.
1588840	1592320	We put our money on the fact that it's holding these things
1592320	1594640	and that this is where they start.
1594640	1596760	And we use it as a bargaining chip
1596800	1598700	as we head into the main house.
1599760	1602120	If we need to dump it out on the floor
1602120	1606720	or throw it on Casper, voice comes to voice.
1606720	1609640	Do you think there's any merit in opening it here now
1609640	1610640	just to see what's in it?
1610640	1612000	Absolutely not. On the grounds here?
1612000	1613520	No, no, I don't.
1613520	1616360	I don't think, no, no.
1617560	1618400	No.
1620080	1623840	All right, Mellon gets really close to Dr. Coombs
1623880	1627720	and puts his hand on his shoulder and says,
1628720	1631800	I could tell that you felt real good when it was inside you,
1633200	1638200	but we're gonna need you to stay.
1639720	1641760	Keep your fucking head on straight, you fucking nut.
1641760	1642720	Thank you.
1642720	1644840	Yeah, yeah, no, of course.
1644840	1648440	I just, if there was a place that we were going to open it,
1648440	1650400	it might be better here and not back at the town.
1650400	1651560	We're not gonna open it.
1651560	1652400	Where everybody is, but.
1652400	1653720	Yeah, we're not gonna open it here.
1654560	1656120	We're not gonna open it in the wolverville.
1656120	1657000	Fucking nowhere.
1657000	1658800	No, this is like worst comes to worst.
1658800	1661960	Like they come in and they say like,
1661960	1663920	we're gonna kill you.
1663920	1664880	We say, no, you're not.
1664880	1668040	We'll pour this on you or on the ground.
1668040	1669880	They probably don't want that either.
1671120	1673080	What if the guy who's got it says,
1673080	1675760	well, what, you're gonna hit me with my lunch pail?
1675760	1676960	And it turns out there's a sandwich
1676960	1678720	and a thermos of coffee in there.
1678720	1682480	Then it will turned out we will have been caught in a bluff.
1682480	1685600	But right now it seems like this is a good chip.
1685600	1689280	We got to roll with it and not let these parasites.
1689280	1690120	I'm with you.
1690120	1691360	Spread in the wolverville.
1691360	1692200	Yeah.
1692200	1694240	Doc, for all we know, these things are in you and me.
1694240	1696080	Well, actually, since we feel like shit
1696080	1698800	and my business partner started doing great,
1698800	1699760	maybe it's in him.
1699760	1700600	I don't know.
1702000	1704560	Maybe it feeds off two hosts simultaneously.
1704560	1705640	We got to figure it out though.
1705640	1707560	Yeah, there's a, you're right, you're right.
1707560	1708400	We shouldn't open it.
1708400	1709280	We shouldn't open it.
1709280	1714280	And, and, and we got to save those kids, QAnon.
1715640	1717960	Yeah, we, God.
1717960	1718800	Oh my God.
1718800	1719640	God.
1727080	1728160	Yeah, let's, let's keep going.
1728160	1731880	Let's see if, let's see if we can find anything down here.
1731880	1734040	I'm going to take that canister from you.
1734040	1735040	That's a good idea.
1736840	1739080	All right, here you go, here you go, Freddy.
1739920	1740760	You can, you can have the gloves.
1740760	1742800	Yeah, maybe put the gloves on your, on your feet.
1748480	1750680	Well, you poke around the rest of the cellars
1750680	1754040	and I mean, there's not really a lot else
1754040	1755520	of interest down here.
1756360	1759560	There is a bit of a wine cellar.
1759560	1762720	There's some fairly nice looking bottles of wine.
1763840	1766320	Should you know anything about wine?
1766320	1768360	Canonically, Thomas Dolan does
1768360	1771000	and he grabs a few nice bottles of wine
1771000	1772440	in case we have success.
1772440	1773280	Excellent.
1773280	1774240	What is that, a red?
1775680	1778600	I spent some time rubbing shoulders with, you know,
1778600	1782840	the Boston Brahmin and I can, I can tell you which,
1782840	1785920	a few of these bottles, you know, they're not,
1785920	1787200	they're not so bad.
1787200	1789120	Mm, tannins.
1789120	1790280	That's right.
1790280	1792920	That's right, Freddy, tannins.
1792920	1794680	Oh, it's got a floral bouquet.
1795560	1797520	I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
1798520	1800800	Well, you poke around the rest of the cellars
1800800	1803600	and apart from your bottles of wine
1803600	1807360	and the canister of whatever the fuck it is you found,
1807360	1810600	you don't really find anything else of interest.
1810600	1812720	It looks like, it looks like they weren't keeping
1812720	1813680	anybody down here.
1813680	1817360	There's nothing, nothing, no signs of entrapment
1817360	1818600	or anything down here.
1819640	1822240	Catherine Zeta-Jones wasn't down here?
1822240	1824920	Catherine Zeta-Jones is not dancing beneath lasers
1824920	1825760	down here.
1829120	1831840	Before we head out, let me just quick poke around
1831840	1834080	just to make sure there's no like hidden doorways
1834080	1837120	or walls that aren't walls or nothing down here.
1837120	1840760	Okay, so you're having your poke around in the cellar.
1840760	1843720	You wanted to try to find any secret doors,
1843720	1846440	so give me a spot hidden roll.
1847640	1849840	Yes, 45 on a 55.
1849880	1852880	Okay, you are fairly certain
1852880	1856200	that there are no secret doors down here.
1856200	1858440	There's no secret areas.
1858440	1860920	It is just a cellar.
1860920	1861840	Voic.
1861840	1863920	What do you think, Mr. Mellon?
1863920	1864920	Did you see any doors?
1864920	1865760	Can we move on up?
1865760	1869080	No, I've been poking and prodding for all the two minutes
1869080	1872360	and there doesn't seem to be any stinking secret doors
1872360	1875680	down here, so I gotta keep my voice down.
1875680	1878400	Let's get back through into the main house
1878400	1879560	and then we'll get going.
1880120	1880960	All right, all right.
1880960	1882560	I'll keep this canister handy.
1882560	1883600	No offense, Mr. Mellon.
1883600	1886440	It's just that you were a snagglepuss there for a second.
1892560	1894160	My name's Frederick Mellon the First
1894160	1896120	and I don't understand the reference.
1898200	1899040	That makes sense.
1899040	1899960	It's 1932.
1901680	1902960	Let's go upstairs.
1903960	1908960	Right, then yeah, you make your way back upstairs
1910840	1914280	and like I say, there is a door that looks like it goes
1914280	1916400	into the main house.
1916400	1918320	Freddie, you should do that ear thing
1918320	1919440	you were doing earlier.
1919440	1922120	Yeah, I'll squish my ear right up against the wall.
1922120	1923600	Okay, give me a listen roll.
1925920	1928600	Oh, that's a fail, 82 on a 50.
1928600	1930720	Yeah, there's no one there.
1930720	1931880	There's no one there.
1933040	1934600	It seems like the coast is clear.
1934600	1935440	Let's go on in.
1936840	1938000	Still be careful though.
1938000	1939360	Still be careful and quiet.
1939360	1940200	Why?
1941920	1942760	That's a good point.
1942760	1943600	There's no one there.
1943600	1945360	We don't have to worry now.
1945360	1946840	We should still be quiet.
1946840	1949840	I carefully cracked the door open about an inch
1949840	1950720	and I peep on through.
1950720	1951920	Yeah, you crack the door open
1951920	1956200	and it opens up into what looks like a fairly large kitchen.
1956200	1961200	There's a dining area there, a range cooker
1961440	1964320	and there's another doorway out from here.
1964320	1965720	Now that you're in the kitchen,
1965720	1970080	you can hear coming from upstairs
1970080	1974400	what sounds like someone snoring fairly loudly.
1974400	1979320	Boys, I don't want to be alarmist.
1979320	1981840	I don't want to jump to conclusions,
1981840	1983360	but it sounds like we might be dealing
1983360	1986000	with a fairytale troll or giant.
1992200	1993840	That's just my first read.
1993840	1995680	Let's move on further into the house
1995680	1997440	and see what we see.
1997440	2000600	Melon puts his finger up to his mouth
2000600	2005600	and like a shh motion points at like a butcher's knife
2005920	2007360	in this kitchen.
2007360	2009280	Dolan, put down your violin.
2011600	2014580	Yeah, that's been on my back this whole time.
2017400	2019560	Obviously since I haven't been playing it
2019560	2022340	and referencing it, it's not because I forgot.
2024560	2026960	I just assumed that you've been providing a soundtrack
2026960	2027960	all the way along.
2033960	2035360	As a rolling stealth check.
2037360	2040020	Tom has stolen his sneaky as fuck.
2041280	2044080	Yeah, so I'll grab that kitchen knife,
2044080	2047120	that big chef's knife and arm myself.
2047120	2048420	Good looking out, Freddie.
2050200	2055120	Are you moving en masse to the source of the snoring?
2055120	2056640	Are you doing something else?
2056640	2057600	What are you up to?
2057600	2059640	I'd like to look around remembering
2059640	2061840	that they were dragged through the shanty town.
2061840	2064120	I want to see if I can see any signs
2064120	2067480	of like dirty floors or more drag marks
2067480	2068960	or anything that would remind me
2068960	2072360	of those bodies being dragged through the dirt like that.
2072360	2074200	Sure, give me a spot heat and roll.
2074200	2079200	It's a fail, a 40 on a 25.
2081440	2084400	Oh, you don't see anything like that.
2084400	2087120	Fellas, I think we should just make our way
2087960	2091240	away from that snoring and find
2091240	2093240	what rooms we can cover down here.
2093240	2094480	And if we don't find the kids,
2094480	2095940	we'll have to go up there.
2095940	2098480	That is the exact opposite of what I was going to say,
2098480	2100080	but I say we go with your plan.
2100080	2104920	You wanted to go see who was snoring?
2104920	2106800	I thought maybe Dolan could put the knife
2106800	2108880	right against the snorer's throat.
2108880	2112000	Yeah, I mean, but what about your shotgun?
2112000	2114520	I mean, I could put it against his throat too,
2114520	2116080	but it's not very sharp.
2119500	2121300	Yeah, it's just more about the element of surprise
2121300	2122320	when you wake up, right?
2122320	2124720	Like if we're not going to kill him in his sleep,
2126840	2128520	getting gravelly again,
2128520	2131320	if you want to kill someone in the sleep,
2131320	2133260	a knife is a knife.
2135880	2138920	A knife in Harvard Yard is a perfect implement,
2138920	2142180	but if you just want to wake somebody up
2142180	2145520	and fucking scare them,
2148040	2150600	then let's go with a shotgun in their face, right?
2158520	2162200	Oh, man.
2162200	2164680	I don't mind the plan of,
2164680	2167880	that would actually cut out a lot of downtime of a search,
2167880	2170200	and if we just wanted to cut straight to the quick
2170200	2171800	and ask the people upstairs,
2171800	2174200	the person who's snoring upstairs,
2174200	2176520	where these kids are.
2176520	2178360	Hey, Sleepy, what the fuck?
2180600	2183160	Oh, good, so you already know what you're going to say.
2185000	2186680	So that's your plan, is it?
2186680	2189080	You're sneaking up the stairs.
2189080	2190320	Are all three of you going?
2190320	2193120	Are you sending one person up?
2193120	2193960	Let's do it.
2194880	2195720	All three.
2195720	2196560	Send it.
2196560	2197880	I think all three, yeah.
2199400	2200400	Send it, bro.
2200400	2204320	Okay, so yeah, with three of you,
2204320	2206480	it's going to be pretty difficult to be stealthy,
2206480	2208920	but on the other hand, you're aided in this
2208920	2211760	by the fact that the person you're sneaking up on
2211760	2213960	is sound asleep.
2214000	2217120	So you make your way up the stairs,
2217120	2219320	which luckily are carpeted,
2220200	2222360	across the landing,
2222360	2226040	and the door to the master bedroom is open.
2226040	2230120	The whole place is fairly expensively furnished.
2230120	2233400	There's all sorts of object art
2233400	2237320	and expensive bits of furniture and so on,
2237320	2238160	but at the same time,
2238160	2241760	the whole place seems to be the best possible evidence
2241760	2243480	that money cannot buy taste
2243880	2245440	because everything just clashes with each other
2245440	2247360	and it all ends up looking a bit shit.
2247360	2251720	And you make your way through to the doorway
2251720	2253040	to the master bedroom,
2253040	2257880	and there is this really ostentatious four-poster bed there,
2257880	2262880	and there is a man lying there in maroon silk pajamas,
2263720	2266160	just lying sprawled across the bed,
2266160	2270120	snoring away at the top of his voice.
2270120	2273080	He's a middle-aged man, he's got graying temples,
2273600	2277360	he's fairly slim, fairly pale as well,
2277360	2280160	and yeah, he's out for the count.
2280160	2285160	Melon hands the canister to Coombs.
2285320	2286160	I take it.
2286160	2288160	Raises the shotgun.
2289240	2290960	How's he laying?
2290960	2293800	Sprawled out, he's on his back,
2293800	2297280	he's sort of starfished out on the bed.
2297280	2298240	Gross.
2298240	2299920	Not a care in the world.
2299920	2304920	Yeah, I'll just aim the shotgun in between his eyes.
2308360	2309400	Okay.
2309400	2311880	Give him a gentle little nudge.
2312720	2314680	Hey, hey.
2314680	2315960	And yeah, he's sort of...
2318320	2319720	His eyes half open.
2319720	2320840	Hey, sleepyhead.
2320840	2323680	And he looks up to see three strange men
2323680	2327880	standing there holding weapons, and he just-
2327920	2330880	Don't move, there's a knife on your balls.
2330880	2332120	He just tenses up.
2333560	2335400	Look, fellas, I don't know what you want.
2335400	2337880	Look, take anything you want, okay?
2337880	2339120	Yeah, you want money?
2339120	2340760	Sure, sure, I got money.
2340760	2342520	Are you Hiram's old partner?
2342520	2346320	He looks really confused at this, and he says,
2346320	2348080	what, Melnick?
2348080	2350440	Yeah, I know Hiram.
2350440	2352840	Well, what's this got to do with Hiram?
2352840	2357840	Not much, except we come from the same Hooverville,
2359680	2362720	but we're the fuck of the kids.
2362720	2367080	Good God.
2368960	2371080	He looks confused for a moment, and...
2373400	2378400	Look, what, the kids, the kids, yeah, okay, the kids.
2379760	2381200	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2382080	2384320	You can see him thinking for a moment.
2384320	2388480	Yeah, yeah, yeah, the kids, the kids from last night.
2388480	2390840	Right, yeah, okay, all right.
2390840	2394160	Then if you want the kids,
2394160	2397640	yeah, I can tell you where to find them,
2397640	2401000	but I'll tell you what, you got to do something for me.
2401000	2406000	Frederick Mellon I pulls back the thumb fellas
2407160	2409360	on his double-barreled shotgun.
2409360	2410720	Yeah, I'll do something for you.
2411120	2414480	I'll do something for you right now, and it's not kill you.
2414480	2417120	But unfortunately, what has not happened yet
2417120	2420200	is that I've not promised to cut off your balls,
2420200	2422640	so why don't you fucking stop talking?
2422640	2427640	He said, look, no, no, no, let's make a deal here, all right?
2427760	2431280	I know, I know who's got your kids.
2431280	2433760	The deal is that I don't cut off your balls.
2433760	2435480	I know who's got your kids.
2435480	2438240	I can make everything right for you,
2438240	2443240	but, but, but, and you can see gears
2443400	2446560	kind of clicking over in his head as he's saying this.
2446560	2451560	Yeah, all right, look, there's a guy who's got your kids.
2451560	2454840	He's got them in another house.
2454840	2458680	I'll tell you what, yeah, you let me phone him up.
2458680	2460680	I'll get him to go over there.
2460680	2463440	Yeah, he'll let the kids out for you.
2463440	2466320	But what you got to do for me is, yeah,
2466520	2469880	you look handy with those guns, with those knives, whatever.
2469880	2473120	Yeah, I mean, when he goes there to let your kids out,
2473120	2474960	you do whatever you want with him.
2474960	2478400	Yeah, I mean, you want to kill someone over this.
2478400	2479720	He's the one who took your kids.
2479720	2481480	You just shoot him.
2481480	2483440	Yeah, yeah, you do that.
2483440	2486120	Everything's fine, everything's great.
2486120	2488920	You're saying that this guy is behind the kidnapping.
2488920	2491280	He's the one that came into our camp and took our children.
2491280	2492120	Yeah.
2492120	2493120	And you had nothing to do with it.
2493120	2494840	They just came to your fucking house.
2494840	2496760	They just used your property.
2496760	2498240	What is this fucking canister?
2498240	2500080	Why don't you tell us what this fucking canister is
2500080	2501440	that we found in your basement?
2501440	2504800	He looks really alarmed as you're holding that up.
2504800	2508120	He says, yeah, you don't want to open that, all right?
2508120	2508960	What if we do though?
2508960	2511000	What if we open it right above your belly button?
2511000	2511840	Yeah, how about that?
2511840	2514160	What if it goes in right above your belly button?
2515840	2517400	Do you want to tell us what's going on?
2517400	2520400	Or do we pour this canister in your fucking abdomen?
2520400	2522680	Does someone want to make an intimidate roll here?
2522680	2525800	Yeah, I think this is a very good opportunity
2525800	2527040	for an intimidate roll.
2530880	2533000	57 on a 50.
2533000	2533840	I'll tell you what,
2533840	2537440	as you are holding this canister above his belly button,
2537440	2539560	I will let you have a bonus die on that.
2539560	2542040	Okay, that's just another D10?
2542040	2542880	Yeah.
2542880	2543720	Or what is that?
2543720	2544760	Yeah, it's another D10
2544760	2547040	and you take that as your 10's result if it's better.
2547040	2548760	Is it lower than a five?
2548760	2550040	No, it's five.
2550040	2550880	Oh, okay.
2551280	2552120	Same thing.
2553120	2554440	So you can spend seven luck
2554440	2556720	and turn that into a success if you want.
2556720	2558000	I will absolutely do that.
2558000	2558840	Okay.
2558840	2561400	I will spend a seven of my 20 luck.
2561400	2563080	So I'm down to 13.
2563080	2564320	Fantastic.
2567040	2568640	Horrifying, that was horrifying.
2568640	2570520	He's looking really scared at this stage
2570520	2572160	and he says, look, fellas,
2572160	2575000	you don't know what you're doing with those things.
2575000	2577440	Just don't let them out of there, okay?
2577440	2580800	All right, I mean, I'll take you to your kids.
2580800	2582960	Why don't you tell us what we're doing with those things?
2582960	2583800	Why don't you tell us
2583800	2586600	what you're doing with those things?
2586600	2589160	You wouldn't believe me if I told you, all right?
2589160	2590240	Why don't you try us?
2590240	2593240	Do you believe that my knife is still on your balls?
2593240	2597000	Do you believe that my knife is still on your balls?
2598120	2598960	All right, look.
2602200	2603720	He says, look, all right,
2605240	2606680	I'll tell you what I know,
2606680	2610160	but look, you're not gonna believe any of this.
2610160	2613560	You guys ever hear of a guy called Aston Hawks?
2613560	2615200	Have we?
2615200	2618240	Actually, I think out of all the pre-gen characters,
2618240	2619720	no, no, you don't.
2621800	2624560	So no, I mean, you may have heard
2624560	2626440	a couple of the people around the camp,
2626440	2631440	maybe Maureen Frayne or Carl Rothstein mention him,
2633400	2636080	but yeah, I mean, you've heard the name.
2636080	2637160	Heard the name?
2637160	2638000	Why?
2638000	2638840	What of it?
2640400	2643880	Hawks, Hawks, he built a machine.
2643880	2645320	Don't ask me how it works.
2645320	2648400	Yeah, Sedgwick, he's the one who knows all that stuff.
2648400	2651160	I don't know, I know how to switch it on.
2651160	2652160	That's about it.
2653040	2656680	But there's this machine and you turn it on
2656680	2661680	and I don't know, he says something about higher realms,
2662240	2664920	higher dimensions, something like that.
2664920	2669920	All I know is that there are these things on the other side
2670560	2674960	these creatures and he points at the canister
2675880	2678960	and it's like we go fishing for them.
2678960	2681680	We get those, we get the good ones,
2681680	2684280	we put them in the canister, those ones we can use.
2684280	2689280	And when we use them, you put them inside someone
2689400	2693600	and it's like they feed on them.
2693600	2696360	They feed on something inside them.
2696360	2698720	But if you're fast, if you're clever,
2698760	2701480	if you get one that's just fed
2701480	2704320	and then you put it inside yourself,
2704320	2707760	it's like everything that it can't digest itself
2707760	2708920	goes into you.
2709760	2714600	Wow, so you're literally feeding on the poor.
2714600	2719600	It sounds so sordid when you put it like that.
2719680	2723760	After it feeds, does it leave the body by itself?
2723760	2726520	Does it, is it full and then it leaves?
2726520	2728080	No, you take it out again.
2728120	2729480	With the forceps?
2729480	2731520	Yeah, you don't want to touch those things with your hands.
2731520	2733200	What happens if it gets out of control?
2733200	2736240	Well, that's again, that's what the forceps are for.
2736240	2738520	You don't want to lose control of these things.
2738520	2743520	So you people did this to the Hooverville on purpose?
2743880	2748880	Well, not you people, Sedgwick did all of this.
2749040	2751360	I mean, yeah, it's not me.
2751360	2753240	Oh, and you just benefited.
2753240	2754080	Well, wouldn't you?
2754080	2756920	No, we're trying to stop this fucking thing.
2756920	2758920	The second we found out about this shit,
2758920	2761440	we thought it was fucked up and we tried to stop it.
2761440	2763760	That's the difference between us and you.
2763760	2765600	Why were these kids in your basement?
2765600	2767160	The kids aren't in my basement.
2767160	2768760	No, but they were in your car.
2769760	2772840	They were dragged here in your car, that's right.
2772840	2775200	They were dragged here in the car to your yard.
2777280	2778400	Like I said, it's Sedgwick,
2778400	2780920	going Sedgwick just got me to drive them.
2780920	2783000	Oh, you're just as fucking chauffeur now?
2783000	2783840	Yeah.
2783840	2786880	Did you get the bugs in your feet or whatever?
2787840	2789840	They went in the doc's feet.
2789840	2793520	He looks completely and comprehendingly at you.
2793520	2798520	What I'm asking is have you had the bugs in you?
2801440	2802280	Yeah.
2802280	2804960	After they fed on people in the Hooverville?
2804960	2807160	Look, like I say, you want Sedgwick,
2807160	2809160	he's the mastermind behind all this.
2809160	2811240	I've had enough to blow this guy's brains out.
2811240	2814280	He seems to me like a willing participant.
2814280	2817360	Yeah, I mean, unless he gives us the address
2817360	2821240	in like three, two.
2821240	2823360	Prospect, he says, prospect.
2823360	2824320	Trigger pulled.
2828760	2832800	Okay, and shall we leave the session there?
2832800	2834360	Yeah, it's a good fight, yeah.
2836040	2839480	As you blow Casper Brinks' brains out
2839480	2841420	all over his expensive silk sheets.
2841820	2845620	Oh, holy shit.
2845620	2849980	Wow, that's awesome.
2849980	2851780	Let's burn this fucking house down.
2851780	2854620	We got so much information out of a person
2854620	2856140	we were about to not disturb.
2859740	2861340	Well, we don't want to be rude.
2863980	2866100	He's sleeping.
2866100	2867180	Shh.
2867180	2870180	You very politely blew his head off.
2870220	2871060	Yes.
2875460	2876300	Wow.
2877420	2881500	As the shotgun blasts, the upper body of Casper Brink
2881500	2884660	gets shredded into just so much meat,
2884660	2888860	bits of him splatter across the four-poster bed
2888860	2892220	and blood pools into the sheets around
2892220	2896620	as his carcass just gives its last few twitches on the bed.
2897580	2899300	Let's have a sanity roll for this bit
2899300	2900660	of cold blooded murder.
2903660	2904500	What?
2905780	2909820	I failed real bad, an 85 on a 37.
2909820	2914060	Yeah, a 98 on a 75.
2914060	2917380	Okay, and how about Mr. Dolan?
2917380	2919380	I rolled an 81, I don't think I passed.
2923020	2925300	Well, it sounds like each one of you has failed,
2925540	2928020	in which case let's have a D6 sand roll
2928020	2929060	for each one of you.
2931260	2932100	Six.
2933060	2934100	Ah, six.
2934100	2935540	I got a five.
2935540	2938620	Fucking hell, holy shit.
2938620	2941220	Okay, can each one of you make intelligence rolls?
2947900	2949460	33 on a 60.
2950340	2952540	I got 17 on a 60.
2952540	2956060	That's 15 on a 70.
2956060	2958060	So you all passed.
2958060	2961940	Well, it's not very often you have three characters,
2961940	2964820	the only three player characters in the scene,
2964820	2967700	go into a bout of badness at the same time.
2972500	2976020	So what I'm going to say, I'll use the rules
2976020	2979900	for what happens if a character on their own
2979940	2981180	has a bout of madness,
2981180	2983500	but just apply it to all three of you.
2983500	2988140	So I think given the shock of what's happened there,
2988140	2992700	and the fact that you perhaps didn't anticipate
2992700	2997700	just what the consequence of this perhaps rash action was,
2998580	3000620	a little while later, the three of you
3000620	3005260	basically find yourself wandering through the Hooverville,
3005260	3010220	just not really quite able to understand how you got there.
3010220	3011660	You don't have the shotgun anymore.
3011660	3013380	You don't know what the hell happened to that.
3013380	3015780	It could be anywhere at this stage.
3015780	3018700	The three of you are still covered with a spray of blood
3018700	3021300	from Brink's exploding corpse.
3022500	3024700	Your ears still have the echo
3024700	3027580	of that shotgun blast going in them.
3027580	3032580	And you perhaps don't really realize what's going on
3032660	3036460	until, let's say, Professor Rothstein
3036460	3039940	just sees these three figures come back into the camp.
3039940	3043460	You're there by the campfire with a few others
3043460	3047100	having what passes for coffee there.
3047100	3050500	And you see, yeah, the three who went off earlier
3050500	3052500	in search of the kids coming back.
3052500	3054820	They are, like I say, covered in blood
3054820	3058380	and some stuff that maybe isn't blood.
3058420	3063100	There's some fleshy bits and fragments of what may be bone
3063100	3064940	wedged in bits of their clothing.
3064940	3068220	And each of them just has this vacant look
3068220	3069820	about their faces.
3069820	3072500	Hello, what is this?
3072500	3073340	Come.
3075460	3078100	I'm looking around at the other people sitting with me
3078100	3080260	and like wide-eyed.
3081220	3084780	Yeah, they're all looking at these three in alarm as well.
3084780	3087580	As Dolan stands there, there's something
3087620	3092620	that just falls off the lapel of his rather tattered coat
3093780	3095300	and lands on the ground.
3095300	3098660	Something kind of gray and spongy
3098660	3100980	that just bounces on the ground
3100980	3104140	that looks unpleasantly organic.
3105580	3106940	Oh my God.
3108420	3113420	I pour three cups of coffee into like little tins
3113460	3116660	and just walk over and offer it to them.
3116660	3119260	I think Nathaniel would like kind of eagerly
3119260	3120820	grab it shaky-handed.
3120820	3122620	Technically you're now an accessory.
3125260	3127460	And he would cup it with two hands
3127460	3130260	and gently try to suck down some coffee.
3130260	3131860	Yeah, it tastes nasty enough
3131860	3134700	that it starts rooting you back in reality.
3134700	3135540	Are you okay?
3139220	3142740	Sure, sure, sure, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
3142740	3143820	Is this blood?
3143820	3146980	Can we talk in private, doc?
3146980	3147820	Sure.
3149460	3152220	And I don't move, I'm standing right by him.
3152220	3154900	You mean like in your tent or something?
3154900	3157260	Oh, yes.
3157260	3160860	I like lead the way to my abode.
3160860	3163740	Dolan makes a comment like,
3163740	3168260	shouldn't have picked up that shift at the butchers
3169660	3171420	to the people around the campfire.
3172100	3175940	We're all probably gonna go vegetarian.
3177220	3180660	Dr. Rothstein leads the three of you off
3180660	3184060	towards his sort of lean-to shack
3184060	3187340	where you can have a private conversation.
3187340	3191020	I pull the tarp aside that I'm using for a door
3191020	3193380	and like usher them inside.
3193380	3195620	Nathaniel Coombs is gonna try and find
3195620	3198260	just the nearest seat that he can sit in
3198260	3201420	and contemplate his existence now
3201420	3204460	as he looks into his cup of bad coffee.
3204460	3206900	Frederick Mellon I hasn't come in yet
3206900	3209100	and you just hear from the other side of the tarp
3209100	3212540	this dry retching from outside
3212540	3216060	and he kinda limps and slowly wiping at his mouth.
3219580	3224580	And then you see his left index finger is just going wild.
3224860	3229220	The rest of him is very, very steady almost,
3229220	3232420	like not moving at all, scared to move
3232420	3235860	but his left index finger just keeps moving.
3235860	3238740	And how about Mr. Dolan, is he going into the shack?
3238740	3240260	Dolan goes into the shack
3240260	3244300	and he's just looking for any kind of water basin
3244300	3249300	or tub, anything to start washing the viscera off with.
3249780	3251980	If he can't find it, he just pours his coffee out
3251980	3253820	on his hands and starts rubbing that.
3255020	3257460	Yeah, I mean, you can start getting yourself a bit cleaner
3257460	3261020	at least sort of get some of the bits out of your hair
3261020	3262700	and beard and stuff like that.
3262700	3263980	Come in, have a seat.
3263980	3268980	Carl, we met somebody that they said a name
3272380	3274700	and it's a name that I've heard you say before.
3276100	3279540	Hawks and Frederick Mellon just runs over like quickly
3279540	3283700	to Carl Rothstein, grabs just blood-soaked hand
3283700	3288700	on your lapel and just holds on less aggressive
3289020	3294020	than desperate and looks at you with pleading eyes.
3294220	3295780	Hawks.
3295780	3296620	Yes.
3298100	3298940	What?
3301140	3304220	Yeah, Carl Rothstein immediately thinks
3304220	3307900	of Professor Hawks and snaps too.
3307900	3309420	Well, that's good.
3309420	3312420	Listen, doc, they're putting bugs in people's bellies,
3312420	3314460	they're laying eggs, they're eating them,
3314460	3315700	weird shit's going on.
3315700	3316540	What do you know about it?
3316540	3317540	Me.
3319060	3320300	No, the other doc.
3320300	3321140	Me?
3321140	3322500	Yeah, you.
3322500	3326900	Rothstein, it seems like you might be stalling.
3326900	3328340	Stalling, no, I'm-
3328340	3330220	Yeah, what did you just walk into the situation
3330220	3333300	without any prior knowledge? I'm just very confused.
3335380	3336660	Let me check my notes
3336660	3338900	and see if I have anything about this.
3339420	3343180	He walks over to a desk on the back.
3343180	3346140	It's called a book called Memories
3346140	3348660	and he clips through it.
3350860	3353700	Austin Hawks, that's the name we heard
3353700	3355380	and I've heard you mention it before.
3355380	3356380	Who is he to you?
3356380	3358940	I was friends with Professor Hawks,
3358940	3361740	but he disappeared.
3361740	3363380	This might sound like a funny question,
3363380	3365100	but when he disappeared, did it feel like
3365100	3367620	any of your greatness disappeared with him?
3368340	3371060	I mean, look at me now, of course.
3371060	3374020	Oh, but this was years before the depression
3374020	3374900	that he disappeared.
3374900	3377740	He disappeared something like eight years ago.
3377740	3379260	A question retracted, doc.
3379260	3381020	I'll forget you ever even asked it.
3381020	3381860	Sustained.
3383340	3386660	I mean, he disappeared under mysterious circumstances.
3386660	3390660	I mean, he used to live in the Prospect Estate with Crawley
3390660	3391980	and was last seen there.
3391980	3394420	Yeah, just read from your book of memories over there.
3394420	3397860	Nathaniel's eyes widen, prospect, prospect.
3397860	3399500	And he's looking at his other guys.
3399500	3404340	Have you men been to a different dimension?
3404340	3407260	We suspect not, but that some kind of creature
3407260	3409980	from a different dimension, you know, is like.
3409980	3413300	The canister, where's the canister?
3413300	3415340	Oh, fucking shit.
3415340	3416180	Nice.
3417820	3419580	Do we at least have the forceps?
3420940	3422180	Nope.
3422740	3423580	God.
3423580	3425700	We must've left it all back there.
3425700	3426540	Oh God.
3427820	3431100	I don't know where we would've, why we would've, I don't.
3431100	3431940	Well, I mean, it's not like
3431940	3434180	he's over there futzing with it, you know.
3434180	3436700	Frederick Mellon the first checks his pockets
3436700	3439940	for keys to a big black Cadillac
3439940	3442860	that he's really hoping that they took with him.
3442860	3445540	Well, I'll tell you what, give me a luck roll
3445540	3448780	to see whether you picked up the keys.
3448780	3451180	I have 70 luck.
3451220	3452860	And I, oh, I passed.
3452860	3454260	I was really scared, I was gonna say that
3454260	3456460	and then still fail, 50.
3456460	3459340	Then yeah, you do check your pockets
3459340	3461900	and you do find the keys to the Cadillac in there.
3461900	3463300	And an ear.
3464420	3465260	Yes.
3468980	3471820	And he holds them both out in one hand.
3471820	3474460	We were at Greenleys, we were at Greenleys
3474460	3476780	and we followed that big black caddy out there.
3476780	3478900	Ida told us at the Blue Star Diner,
3478900	3480580	that's what led us all the way out there
3480820	3482340	and then we decided we heard the man sleeping
3482340	3484900	and we thought, oh no, forget it, you're home to Bel Air.
3484900	3487020	And we said, let's go upstairs and maybe check on him.
3487020	3489980	But then we killed him and now he took his car.
3489980	3491540	Okay, so if we have his car,
3491540	3493380	we'll be able to get back there pretty easily
3493380	3494700	because we need that canister
3494700	3496020	and we probably need the shotgun.
3496020	3497340	Maybe he's got other stuff too.
3497340	3499340	We can disguise ourselves with his clothes
3499340	3501540	and maybe other guns that he might have,
3501540	3503020	recheck his basement perhaps,
3503020	3504140	but maybe we don't have time
3504140	3505500	because we need to get the prospect.
3505500	3507580	Oh, fuck Carl, are you gonna come with us?
3507580	3509020	Please help.
3509020	3513460	Carl is standing in his little shack
3513460	3517740	surrounded by these men covered in goo and blood
3517740	3518700	and who knows what.
3518700	3522660	And he's wide-eyed the entire time
3522660	3524620	that Frederick is saying that.
3525860	3529580	If you need my help, I'll come.
3529580	3530420	I'm not sure.
3530420	3532180	He doesn't seem convinced yet, Carl.
3532180	3534980	Dr. Coombs, please tell him about the creatures.
3534980	3535900	Tell him about the creatures.
3535900	3537100	Tell him how fucked up it was.
3537100	3538380	The creatures, listen, Carl,
3538380	3540140	the long and short of it is we've killed tonight
3540140	3541140	and we'll kill again.
3543980	3545220	Who did you kill?
3547940	3549660	You if you don't come with us.
3549660	3551620	Whoa, what?
3552660	3553820	Are you serious?
3553820	3556020	Carl, do you know where Prospect is?
3556020	3557700	I want to say yes.
3559620	3561020	Then do it, man, damn it.
3561020	3562620	It's a couple of miles from here.
3562620	3564820	It's a couple of miles down the road towards Arkham.
3564820	3569300	Of course, I mean, are you going to hurt me?
3569300	3570540	Not if you take us there, doc.
3570540	3572740	Okay, how do you suppose we get there?
3572740	3574620	Frederick holds up the ear.
3574620	3575580	I mean the keys.
3577260	3582260	Okay, yeah, if you drive, I can show you the way.
3582820	3587060	Maybe you can fill me in on some stuff on the way.
3587060	3587900	I doubt it.
3590780	3593420	The car, which is parked at a crazy angle
3593420	3596100	on some waste ground between the main road
3596100	3598420	and the shanty town.
3600820	3602660	As long as there's no cops around it,
3602660	3605300	then Frederick turns back and is like,
3605300	3609140	hey, and if we're super lucky, then maybe in the trunk,
3609140	3613260	there's a shotgun and a canister of void fish.
3613260	3614900	Of what?
3614900	3616860	I was just calling them void fish.
3616860	3617780	What a void fish.
3617780	3619180	Well, they lay eggs.
3619180	3620860	That's about all we know of their biology.
3620900	3625340	I'm from a void and I'm a big adventure zone fan.
3625340	3626180	All right.
3626180	3628180	Okay, I'm going to sit in the passenger seat
3628180	3630540	and you just tell me when you're ready.
3630540	3631380	Oh, that's good.
3631380	3633500	Cause I got that one all bloody on the way over here.
3633500	3635340	So I'm going to sit in the back in the first seat.
3635340	3639540	What I'd like at this stage then is a group luck roll.
3639540	3642340	So whoever's got the lowest luck out of the four of you
3642340	3643660	guests make a luck roll.
3643660	3644940	I think that's Thomas.
3646820	3649460	He spent seven on the 20 he had.
3649460	3651100	Oh God. So he's got 13.
3651100	3651940	Yeah.
3651940	3652980	I'm not sure how much,
3652980	3654940	cause I got a bonus for a little bit.
3654940	3656500	Did that get taken away from me?
3656500	3658180	No, no, you still have that.
3658180	3659940	Okay. Then I've got 25.
3659940	3661660	All right, Thomas, you got this.
3661660	3662900	All right, here it goes.
3664420	3665420	85.
3665420	3666700	Hell yeah, dude.
3666700	3667620	Okay.
3667620	3670460	So as you're getting into the car,
3670460	3672220	there's no sound of the shotgun,
3672220	3677220	but you do see that the canister is there in the back seat.
3677380	3678380	At some point.
3678380	3679220	Is it open?
3679980	3681740	At some point it seems to have got open.
3681740	3686740	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
3687620	3690780	Is it, is it sitting open as we get in the car or is it?
3690780	3691620	Oh yes.
3691620	3692580	Is it resealed?
3692580	3693420	It's sitting up.
3693420	3696980	No, no, it's sitting there on its side in the footwell,
3696980	3698500	the top of it off.
3698500	3699340	Yeah.
3699340	3702380	Can we do a search or spot hit and roll for any of these,
3702380	3703860	these creatures in the car?
3703860	3704860	You certainly can.
3704860	3706140	Like lurking under the seat.
3706140	3708420	Or inside of us.
3708460	3711180	I pass 43 on a 55.
3711180	3715580	You do see something gray
3715580	3719260	as wriggling underneath one of the seats.
3719260	3724260	You also notice a trail going through the undergrowth
3724660	3727420	away from where the car is parked,
3727420	3730020	heading in the direction of the camp.
3730020	3730860	Oh shit.
3732860	3735380	That is very, very not good.
3735380	3737620	Well, look on the bright side fellas,
3737660	3739940	we let it escape, but we do have the canister,
3739940	3741420	so we can't recontain it.
3741420	3742980	Are there forceps there?
3742980	3743820	No.
3743820	3745900	Doc, you took a Hippocratic oath,
3745900	3749220	so I nominate you to grab the creature when we find it.
3749220	3750700	Yeah, just scoop it.
3750700	3752900	I'm sitting in the passenger seat.
3752900	3755580	I'm finally like soaking in some blood that was on it
3755580	3757180	and like feeling wet.
3757180	3758220	And I hear that.
3759980	3761340	Whatever you need, just.
3761340	3762580	That's wicked good of you, Doc.
3762580	3763820	It's for mankind.
3765300	3766140	Okay.
3766180	3767540	Keep in mind when we say Doc,
3767540	3771380	we're talking to both Doc Combs and Doc Rothstein
3771380	3772220	at the same time.
3772220	3774420	I felt like I dodged a bullet there, yeah.
3774420	3775260	Thanks.
3778780	3782180	I'm not gonna go around thinking of two names for doctors.
3785300	3788100	I mean, you were obviously out of it for a while.
3788100	3791300	At this stage, it is beginning to get dark.
3791300	3794020	So are you following the trail of this thing
3794020	3795180	back towards the camp?
3795180	3796940	Are you staying in the car
3796940	3800540	and trying to deal with the thing that's loose there?
3800540	3803580	Are you finding another way of getting into prospect?
3803580	3804900	What's your plan?
3804900	3809260	This Austin Hawks guy, we were told he built some machine.
3809260	3811460	I think it's this thing that brings these creatures in.
3811460	3814460	He might have more sophisticated ways of capturing them.
3814460	3817220	When you got a problem, you gotta root it out at its source.
3817220	3820060	Otherwise, the little fingers that go out in the toes
3820060	3823620	that spread their little wormy ways into the world around it
3823660	3826220	will just continue to grow and grow.
3826220	3829300	If you cut off one finger, then you got nine left.
3829300	3831980	But if you cut off two hands at the same time,
3831980	3833340	then you got no fingers.
3834380	3835980	I think we should find this thing
3835980	3837420	before it infects the camp.
3840020	3842940	I think we should probably help the people.
3842940	3845340	It doesn't seem like a finger.
3845340	3846980	It seems more like its own thing
3846980	3849540	that can operate independently of a hand.
3849540	3851980	Maybe we should help the people real quick.
3852020	3855500	Because the big fancy place, that's not going nowhere.
3855500	3857220	But this thing's on the move.
3857220	3859260	How would we begin to find it?
3859260	3862660	It seems to have left a pretty clear trail, right?
3862660	3863500	Yeah.
3863500	3865380	You've noticed, certainly,
3865380	3867380	there's some of the undergrowth that's been disturbed
3867380	3870460	and it is leaving a fairly subtle trail of slime,
3870460	3872940	which you've managed to spot.
3872940	3876820	Like I say, it is beginning to get dark at this stage.
3876820	3879380	You're gonna have to try to find it fairly quickly.
3879380	3882580	Otherwise, you're going to lose it in the dark.
3882580	3883940	I thought my analogy was great,
3883940	3885300	but I'm easily persuadable.
3885300	3886980	Let's search for this thing.
3886980	3889380	So you carry on following this trail
3889380	3893300	and it goes up to one of the tents.
3893300	3896940	And you realize, yeah, it's the tent that Nancy Carver
3896940	3901260	was in earlier, the woman who'd seen the weird stuff
3901260	3906260	last night and had gone into some kind of fugue stated
3906300	3907340	as a result.
3908340	3911940	And this thing just goes up to the fabric
3911940	3913380	on the side of her tent.
3913380	3916500	And then there's just this wet spot in the fabric
3916500	3918860	of the tent as if it's moved through it.
3919940	3920780	Yuck.
3921980	3922900	Wicked yuck.
3926060	3927700	That's a no from me, dog.
3927700	3930180	Should we look around in the tent?
3930180	3933180	Nancy, Nancy, you in there?
3933180	3936660	You can hear the sound of someone breathing heavily
3936820	3938580	as if they're sleeping.
3938580	3941940	And as you shout her name, she stirs a little bit
3941940	3946940	and her first reaction is a sort of whimpering sound.
3947100	3951700	And then she says, who is it?
3951700	3953580	We got faces, I'll tell you that much.
3953580	3957100	It's Fredrick Mellon I, Carl Rothstein, Thomas Dolan,
3957100	3958900	and Daniel Coombs.
3958900	3960980	That's two doctors, we're very legitimate.
3960980	3962260	We're here to check up on you, Nancy.
3962260	3964460	We know you had quite a day yesterday.
3964460	3965620	I just need to sleep.
3965700	3966980	I need to sleep.
3967900	3968900	Yeah, that makes sense.
3968900	3971260	But we're worried about a situation
3971260	3975940	that has come to become a present issue.
3975940	3979220	If you could come on out, please, or allow us to come in.
3979220	3981380	There's a bit of movement inside
3981380	3986380	and she staggers up to the door of her tent
3987780	3990060	and opens it up.
3990060	3995020	And yeah, she's looking very pale in the fading light.
3995260	3998020	Her eyes are a bit unfocused,
3998020	4001460	her hands trembling as it's holding onto the tent flap.
4001460	4003340	What is it?
4003340	4004180	What do you want?
4007180	4009420	Excuse us for one moment, Nats.
4009420	4011980	Could we huddle real quick?
4014660	4015700	So she's got it, right?
4015700	4017780	She's, it's, that's-
4017780	4019460	Yeah, it's inside of Lee.
4019460	4020300	Yeah.
4020300	4022420	What is inside of her?
4022460	4025780	It's a void fish, if you like, a space bug.
4025780	4027540	You can pick your own name for it.
4027540	4029900	Okay, how do we get it out?
4029900	4031300	They enter the body,
4031300	4033260	but the problem is they don't leave a sign
4033260	4034180	that they've entered the body.
4034180	4038780	It's almost like it creates a camouflage of the wound.
4038780	4039820	A wet door.
4039820	4041420	How do you know she's got it?
4041420	4043540	It makes you look like that.
4043540	4044380	Look at her.
4044380	4049380	Oh, okay, so do we kill her?
4050380	4054820	No, I think we gotta take her with us to a place.
4054820	4055660	Thank God.
4056660	4058580	Thanks for asking, though.
4058580	4060380	I did not want to do it.
4060380	4065380	I know, but sometimes you just have to in these situations.
4068180	4071380	I don't, I don't know about that.
4071380	4073300	The thing here that we've learned is that
4073300	4076060	they put these in and then take them out of people.
4076060	4078700	So there's a way to do it safely.
4079020	4079980	Doink doink doink doink.
4079980	4084580	Do either one of you have any forceps in your shanty tent?
4084580	4085420	I probably do.
4085420	4087140	Any sort of metal grabbers?
4087140	4090940	I'm a physics professor, so no.
4090940	4092620	So no physical objects then?
4092620	4095420	Dr. Coombs would have something suitable
4095420	4096940	in his medical shack.
4096940	4098580	I've got some forceps.
4098580	4100940	And I do, I run back and I also,
4100940	4102340	if I can find a pair of gloves,
4102340	4103660	I'd like to grab some gloves.
4103660	4106060	Yeah, yeah, you can do that.
4106460	4111220	As you go in, Maureen Frain is coming out of,
4111220	4113740	well, she was obviously sleeping before
4113740	4117700	and her eyes open up as you come into the shack.
4117700	4120580	And she looks like, oh, Dr. Coombs, have you got news?
4120580	4121660	Have you found Esther?
4121660	4122900	We're working on it.
4122900	4126740	We think we're on the right track.
4126740	4128580	We don't have any reason to believe
4128580	4132860	something bad has happened per se yet at all.
4132860	4137060	And we're gonna find her.
4137060	4139740	She starts trying to get out of her bunk
4139740	4142140	as if to try to come and help you
4142140	4144780	and then just collapses back into it.
4144780	4147740	You need to get some more rest there, Maureen.
4147740	4150620	That's what's gonna make you feel better eventually.
4151980	4155500	All right, but do get her back safe, please, Doctor, please.
4155500	4157260	We're on it.
4157260	4159860	And yeah, I'm going for forceps and gloves.
4159860	4162700	Yep, you can grab those and head back to Nancy's tent.
4163380	4164660	When I get back to the tent, I say,
4164660	4167340	there's a chance Maureen has it too back at my place.
4167340	4168940	But I got the forceps and the gloves.
4168940	4170940	So what, do we just start poking around on her
4170940	4172020	and find the wet door?
4172020	4174540	Yeah, I'm not sure how to go about this.
4174540	4176740	We gotta go to the place
4176740	4180540	and find the people who are doing this.
4180540	4183140	What, no, Dolan, you just said
4183140	4185580	that we needed to fix the situation here at home.
4185580	4187780	And now as soon as we find the situation,
4187780	4189340	you're trying to bail out? No, no, no, I said
4189340	4191180	we need to track down the creature.
4191180	4193140	We found where it is.
4193140	4193980	We know exactly where it is.
4193980	4196140	It could easily leave her once it gets full
4196140	4197700	and then find another person.
4197700	4199900	Then when we get back, it's somewhere else.
4199900	4202020	Although I guess it would have given that person strength.
4202020	4203940	I'm really not sure how to say it.
4203940	4207580	Are you having this conversation in front of Nancy?
4207580	4208980	Yeah.
4208980	4210940	Probably actually.
4210940	4211900	Yeah.
4211900	4216180	Okay, her eyes are getting wider and wider and wider.
4217660	4219420	I'm sitting down next to Nancy's,
4219420	4221060	just kind of like holding her up
4221900	4224260	and taking all of it in with her too.
4224260	4226780	Carl, Carl, what are they talking about?
4226780	4228380	What are they talking about?
4228380	4230220	Everything you saw was real.
4231660	4233660	Oh God, oh God.
4233660	4236700	I think there's some kind of parasite in the camp.
4236700	4238060	And do you think it's gotten to me?
4238060	4238900	Yeah.
4238900	4240140	Oh, I think I might have it too.
4240140	4241140	You'll be okay.
4241140	4242300	Yeah, I've got one too.
4242300	4243940	It's just going around.
4243940	4246540	We've all had it, Nance, and we survived,
4246540	4249660	but we gotta figure out how to get it out of you.
4249660	4252180	That's why I think, Freddie, that we need to go,
4252180	4254740	you know, like you said earlier to the source.
4254740	4256300	I hope you know this isn't a flip flop.
4256300	4259020	This is a fluid situation is what they call it.
4259020	4261020	Yeah, no, 100%, I agree.
4261020	4262500	I was right at the beginning too.
4262500	4265740	So what do I do if I've got this parasite inside me,
4265740	4266780	what do I do about it?
4266780	4267820	How do I get it out?
4267820	4269100	Ah, just take a nap.
4269100	4271740	We're working on how to get it out,
4271740	4274580	but just so you know, you've got time.
4274580	4276140	I've seen this before.
4276140	4277460	There's no reason to think
4277460	4279260	that you're in any immediate danger.
4279740	4281140	We'll figure out how to get it out of you
4281140	4282180	and then we'll get it out of you.
4282180	4284500	It is imperative that you realize you will be fine.
4284500	4288540	It just takes your potential and your ability and your joy
4288540	4290260	and it gives it to somebody
4290260	4292700	of a better social standing than you.
4292700	4293540	Is this what-
4293540	4296100	Harold Priestley lived for what, like a week or two?
4296100	4296940	Yeah, is this what happened?
4296940	4298140	Before he became Crumbly Dust?
4298140	4299500	This is what happened to Harold.
4299500	4301700	I heard, I heard-
4301700	4302740	Yeah, 100%.
4302740	4304580	I heard his face fell off.
4304580	4306940	Oh yeah, it was gross.
4306940	4307780	That wasn't the end stage though.
4307780	4308940	We believe we've caught it.
4308940	4311460	Yeah, we believe we've caught it pre-face crumble.
4311460	4314260	So you just hold on tight, Matt,
4314260	4316540	take a little nap and we're gonna get you fixed up.
4316540	4318420	Be sure and drink lots and lots of water.
4318420	4321100	That's what the crumbling was from a lack of water.
4321100	4324260	So just make sure you're keeping the fluid intake.
4326820	4327940	Oh, and by the way,
4327940	4331380	if you see a little buggy crawl out of you-
4331380	4332220	Stop that.
4332220	4333180	Maybe don't-
4333180	4334780	Don't stomp it, burn it.
4334780	4335620	Right.
4335620	4337420	Oh yeah, with fire, kill it with fire.
4337900	4340780	None of this seems to be comforting her in the slightest.
4340780	4342060	Really?
4342060	4342900	Scott, really?
4342900	4344260	Some people just can't be reasoned with,
4344260	4345740	so it's not really my fault.
4345740	4347820	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
4347820	4349740	It's like when you see a snake and it bites you,
4349740	4354340	you grab it so that you can identify what snake bit you.
4354340	4355780	It's the same thing.
4355780	4359500	Well, doc, like we said, you don't wanna grab it.
4359500	4361300	It can move through your skin.
4362980	4365180	It will just in a you if you grab it, so.
4365180	4366020	Then how do you-
4366020	4370540	On stage, Nancy is just curled up on the pile of newspapers
4370540	4373020	and old grags that she's using as a bed
4373020	4374540	and is in the fetal position
4374540	4377780	and is just curled up around herself, shaking.
4377780	4379780	That's good, that's self-care.
4379780	4381460	You're doing it right, Nancy, that's good.
4381460	4383140	We'll be back as soon as we can
4383140	4384580	and we'll get this figured out for you.
4384580	4388260	Don't worry, you're in capable hands here with Dr. Coons.
4388260	4391300	And Nancy, remember, you still owe me a can of beans,
4391300	4394380	so when you get over this, don't forget.
4394380	4399380	Doc, as a physician-
4399540	4401460	Yes, that's what they call us.
4401460	4403580	Yeah, don't demoralize the patient.
4404940	4409340	Oh, I'm giving her a reason to live, to pay her debts.
4411460	4412380	To feel good.
4414380	4416420	That's what America's all about, baby.
4416420	4418300	That's a very Teutonic perspective.
4418300	4420860	I came to a capitalist country
4420860	4424740	and, you know, it's treating me, you know, ill enough.
4427780	4431580	He laughs and looks around like very sad.
4434580	4436780	We should get to Prospect.
4436780	4438700	Yeah, now that you've completely destroyed
4438700	4440540	Nancy Carver's spirit,
4440540	4444020	you're heading back off towards Prospect, are you?
4444020	4445380	Yeah, you're right, Thomas Dolan.
4445380	4447140	That was a very good idea.
4448260	4450580	We isolated a variable.
4450580	4454940	I'm not gonna apologize for demystifying the situation.
4454940	4457260	I wasn't being sarcastic.
4457260	4458540	Now she won't run away.
4459660	4462020	There was still, last time you checked,
4462020	4464260	one of these things loosened the car as well.
4464260	4466580	You did see it wriggling under one of the seats.
4466580	4467500	And we left it there.
4467500	4468900	Oh yeah, whoops.
4468900	4469740	All right.
4470940	4473020	I think Carl agreed to try to scoop it.
4473020	4476420	So when we get back to the car, is it still there?
4476420	4478260	Well, let's have a group luck roll
4478260	4479700	to see whether it's still there.
4479740	4481060	So that's just Thomas.
4481060	4481900	On me again?
4481900	4482740	Yeah, all right.
4485660	4489420	21, so I've been so close without that modifier.
4491700	4494820	In which case, hmm, no.
4494820	4496260	By the time you get back to the car,
4496260	4497620	I think it is quite gloomy now,
4497620	4499460	but you don't see any trace of it.
4499460	4501260	And now I'm gloomy,
4501260	4503300	because I just know I'm gonna sit on it.
4504540	4506700	How big are these things?
4506700	4509500	The one you saw wriggling under the seat
4510140	4512500	was probably about the size of your forearm.
4512500	4513340	Oh, Jesus.
4513340	4514820	Okay, so not too small.
4516500	4519180	I'm gonna get in the driver's seat this time.
4519180	4521740	When you're ready, I will drive there.
4521740	4523820	Frederick Mellon I tosses you in here.
4525860	4528500	It disgusts me.
4528500	4529340	Oh, whoopsie.
4529340	4531580	It comes back to me that you were covered in blood and stuff
4531580	4533820	and I'm scared, very scared again.
4533820	4535260	Sorry about that.
4535260	4536140	Toss me the keys.
4536140	4539220	I'm like shaking and start the car.
4539820	4542140	I feel like I'm being taken hostage almost.
4543140	4543980	Yeah.
4543980	4546620	I want to note that I still got forceps with me.
4546620	4550020	So if anything goes down, I can still maybe help.
4550020	4552180	Man, those are nice gloves.
4552180	4554540	It doesn't take you very long
4554540	4557700	for Dr. Rothstein to drive you to Prospect,
4557700	4558740	because like I say,
4558740	4561300	it is just a couple of miles down the road.
4561300	4562660	As we're on our way,
4562660	4564580	as we're passing Blue Star Diner,
4564580	4565660	should we,
4565700	4569900	boys, should we stop and grab that shotgun at Greenleys
4569900	4572220	or are we completely fucked regardless?
4572220	4574180	Well, from, I mean,
4574180	4575340	from one point of view,
4575340	4577260	it's already served its purpose in the story,
4577260	4578220	but it could be,
4580700	4582980	could still be useful, I don't know.
4582980	4586620	After your experiences of the trauma
4586620	4589460	after murdering Mr. Brink,
4589460	4592900	are you really happy going back to the murder scene?
4592900	4594740	Carl, can you get something for us?
4595660	4600660	I would be afraid you'd use it on me, so no.
4603180	4604340	You can hold it.
4604340	4605500	I'd rather not.
4605500	4606980	It's good you don't want your prints on there.
4606980	4607820	That's smart.
4607820	4608740	That's why I adopted.
4608740	4611540	It seems like you may have done something horrible
4611540	4612460	with it as well.
4612460	4614980	So preferably not.
4614980	4616060	I don't know about you guys,
4616060	4618980	but I don't really remember what happened after all that.
4618980	4621140	There's a chance that we left the shotgun in the woods
4621140	4622140	somewhere on our way back.
4622140	4625140	I don't know where it might even be in there.
4625460	4626300	Let's not waste time.
4626300	4627940	Let's just go get some answers.
4627940	4628900	Yeah, it is.
4628900	4630860	It is almost dark now
4630860	4633100	and there are still two missing children.
4634820	4638060	I hope we don't feel like we needed that shotgun later.
4639700	4641340	I'm sure you'll be fine.
4644220	4645700	Yeah, Prospect, huh?
4645700	4648460	So yeah, you drive the couple of miles up the road
4648460	4649820	towards Prospect.
4649820	4654300	So this is another one of these estates like Greenlee's
4654340	4656380	that's set back from the road.
4656380	4660860	This one though does have a stone wall around the grounds.
4660860	4664940	You pull the car up to the gates outside
4664940	4667380	and the gates are a bit rusted.
4667380	4670820	There is still in Gothic script written over the top
4670820	4675140	of the metal gates in wrought iron, just the word Prospect.
4675140	4680140	And in the dying light, you can see the perhaps ruins
4681140	4685420	or not quite ruins, but the abandoned house itself
4685420	4687340	up at the top of the slope.
4687340	4692060	The grounds in this light look incredibly overgrown.
4692060	4695740	You can also just through the gates,
4695740	4699100	make out some outbuildings,
4699100	4701740	but you're not quite sure what they are.
4701740	4705300	The gates themselves have got a chain
4705300	4707380	and a padlock around them.
4707620	4711020	While the gates are fairly rusty,
4711020	4713700	the chain and padlock look quite new.
4713700	4715380	Well, that's one of the new ones.
4715380	4720380	And you know, ever since they got this new lock mechanism,
4720540	4724420	gizmo technology, it takes maybe a second or third try
4724420	4727180	here and there, but I'm pretty good with these
4727180	4730060	and starts rooting around in his clothes,
4730060	4733140	finding his like lock picking set.
4733140	4734980	Okay, yeah, give me a locksmith roll
4734980	4737180	to see what you can pop it easily.
4738020	4739020	A 10 on a 70.
4739020	4742220	Oh yeah, well, the chain looks solid.
4742220	4744340	They clearly used a cheap lock here.
4744340	4747220	So you pretty much just slide the picks in
4747220	4748900	and the whole thing pops open.
4748900	4750060	And he turns around and he's like,
4750060	4751940	that's one of the most advanced locks
4751940	4755300	that exists here in this time period.
4755300	4757780	And your boy, Frederick Mellon, the voice,
4757780	4759660	got it while winking at you, huh?
4759660	4760500	And he winks.
4760500	4763940	Thomas Dolan winks back with a little song on his fiddle.
4764620	4767300	I forgot about that film.
4767300	4769700	So did I, I just saw it on my character sheet.
4771620	4773180	But yeah, you get the gates open.
4773180	4775580	Are you leaving the car on the road?
4775580	4778820	Are you driving it up towards the house?
4778820	4780580	But do you want me to do drive it up?
4780580	4781940	They'll think Casper's coming
4781940	4786940	and Casper seemed to have an issue with Sedgwick.
4787020	4789740	I think he wanted us to kill him, honestly.
4789740	4793420	He seemed like he really would have been cool
4793900	4795460	with us knocking him out.
4795460	4800460	So if I were Sedgwick and I saw Casper bring his car
4800580	4804620	coming up, I would feel uneasy about that and negative.
4804620	4807540	And then the fact that he's not even in the car,
4807540	4810860	maybe we could play it off like we killed him for Sedgwick.
4810860	4813100	Like we heard that they were having issues
4813100	4815540	and we wanted to join in on the madness.
4816420	4817260	I don't know.
4817260	4818220	What do you guys think?
4818220	4820740	We don't know for sure that Sedgwick is here, right?
4820740	4822620	This is Austin Hawk's house.
4822740	4825740	Maybe he's a live-in helper with the machine.
4825740	4826580	That could be.
4826580	4827500	With a machine like that,
4827500	4830180	I don't think that the man who knows how it works
4830180	4831820	would be too far away.
4831820	4834980	I'm worried about the going in part,
4834980	4837540	but it would be nice to have a going out ride.
4837540	4838380	Does that make sense?
4838380	4839900	I'm worried that it's really conspicuous
4839900	4841260	for our car to go up the driveway,
4841260	4843580	but I'd love to have a car ready to go down that driveway
4843580	4845740	when we were trying to leave this place.
4845740	4846940	It's a pretty nice car.
4846940	4848100	It's the Depression.
4848100	4852460	I think going up in this nice car gives us some good cover
4853300	4854860	on the way up there and gives us an escape route.
4854860	4856660	I think we take the car.
4856660	4857980	We just back it in.
4857980	4862260	Yeah, you make your way up the driveway.
4862260	4865220	I mean, it's going to be quite difficult to back it in
4865220	4867580	because this is a winding driveway
4867580	4869620	and it's quite badly overgrown.
4869620	4871900	The weeds are quite high on the other side.
4871900	4876780	It's going to be tricky because with it getting dark,
4876780	4878580	you probably want the headlights
4878580	4880580	pointing in front of you at the moment
4880620	4884420	to avoid crashing into a tree or a sapling or something.
4884420	4885620	I mean, if you really want,
4885620	4887140	I can give you a drive auto roll
4887140	4888660	just to reverse it in there,
4888660	4891940	but it is the harder way of doing it.
4891940	4894540	I think we should just go in straight on.
4894540	4896140	There's surely a roundabout it,
4896140	4898940	but these estates all have those trees.
4898940	4899820	I'm a good driver.
4899820	4901340	I'll back it in.
4901340	4902180	Okay.
4904060	4906060	You give me a drive auto roll then.
4906060	4908380	Okay, let me see what my drive auto is.
4908380	4909460	God damn it, Luke.
4910620	4911460	Yeah.
4915140	4917340	Like surely he wouldn't just say that.
4918820	4920860	It's not on my character sheet,
4920860	4922060	so I think it's just a 20.
4922060	4924220	Yeah, so that means it's 20.
4924220	4925060	Yeah.
4925060	4925900	Sweet.
4925900	4926740	You dick.
4926740	4928220	41.
4928220	4929780	How much luck do you have?
4929780	4931020	20.
4931020	4931860	Fuck.
4932700	4936900	So you reverse the car up and about halfway up,
4936900	4939380	like I say, it's very badly overgrown
4939380	4941860	and you just misjudge it slightly
4941860	4946260	and you've gone off the path or at least off the driveway
4946260	4951140	and you're reversed into some soft ground
4951140	4956020	and the car is now sort of, yeah,
4956020	4960900	stuck in this slightly marshy ground just to one side.
4960900	4962020	Is this a good spot?
4964180	4966940	Yeah, if we just like throw something
4966940	4969540	under the back tires then, you know,
4969540	4971780	it'll be ready for takeoff and we can head out.
4971780	4972940	Something like you, Kyle.
4972940	4974380	That was my plan.
4974380	4975980	Not me though, no.
4975980	4976820	Ha ha.
4976820	4977660	Ha ha.
4977660	4979860	So you're getting out to try to put something
4979860	4982420	under the back tires so you can get out.
4982420	4984420	It's now pretty dark.
4984420	4988020	There's still a little bit of light, but not very much.
4988020	4989740	It hasn't been raining today,
4989740	4992620	but as you brush up against something undergrowth,
4992620	4997620	some of it does feel uncomfortably moist
4997900	5001620	and you can hear just the sounds
5001620	5005300	of things rustling around in the undergrowth,
5005300	5007620	things you can't see in the darkness.
5010140	5012020	Boys, I think we should run.
5012020	5015100	Thomas Dolan is just booking it for the house up the road.
5015100	5015940	Okay.
5015940	5018020	He starts running when he hears the Slytherin.
5018020	5018900	I'm not giving up.
5018900	5020900	We'll deal with Dolan in a moment
5020940	5023900	as he's separated himself off from the others.
5023900	5027220	The other three of you are still there at the car.
5027220	5031340	So is it Frederick Mellon I and Dr. Coombs
5031340	5035780	who are trying to help get the car out of the quagmire?
5035780	5037260	Yeah, yes indeedy.
5037260	5039660	Yeah, as you're kind of digging around,
5039660	5042820	trying to find solid stuff to put under the tire,
5042820	5046340	a couple of times, yeah, you can feel things
5046340	5049260	in the darkness just kind of slithering
5049260	5051660	across the back of your hand.
5051660	5053780	You can't see what they are.
5053780	5056340	Nathaniel, when one of those slithers
5056340	5059300	perfectly across his hand, he jerks back.
5059300	5062180	For Frederick, there's stuff out here.
5062180	5063900	There's that crickling sound.
5063900	5066140	That's not squirrels.
5066140	5067100	It was slimy.
5067100	5069820	Yeah, it's making my stomach hurt when I think about it,
5069820	5072500	but eh, we got to keep going.
5073820	5075220	We got to make sure the car gets out.
5075220	5077940	That way we can bail effectively.
5077940	5080460	In which case, yeah, if you're grabbing stuff
5080460	5084100	to put under the tire, part of that is going to involve
5084100	5089100	lifting the car up enough to get the stuff under the tire.
5090100	5095100	What I suggest then is one of you give me a strength roll
5096020	5098020	just to see whether you can pull this off.
5099100	5100860	They look at each other.
5100860	5103020	All right, young man, I think that's on you.
5103540	5108540	I pass, a 19 on a 50.
5109060	5109900	Yes.
5109900	5110740	Oh, nice.
5110740	5113660	Okay, so yeah, you think you've managed to get enough stuff
5113660	5116780	under there and sure enough, when Dr. Rothstein starts up
5116780	5120140	the car, it just pulls forward onto the track.
5121340	5123300	Now, Mr. Dolan.
5123300	5124140	Yes.
5124140	5128420	Mr. Dolan was running up towards the house in the gloom.
5128420	5130380	As you make your way towards the building,
5130420	5133420	from the undergrowth, just after your right,
5133420	5135020	you hear a sound.
5136300	5139340	The sound, you're not quite sure what it is at first,
5139340	5142260	but as you move past, you can hear a sort of
5142260	5143260	a sound,
5160060	5161980	and it's just going on and on.
5161980	5163900	Can I see anything?
5163900	5166540	No, it's coming from the undergrowth,
5166540	5167940	and it's getting quite dark.
5169340	5170180	Hello?
5172300	5173140	Oh.
5176740	5179820	Hey there, are you a missing child?
5186260	5189300	I'd really like to find and comfort you if you are,
5189300	5191940	but there's some freaky shit out here.
5196260	5198020	Oh, God damn it, Thomas.
5198020	5199460	All right, and he goes into the,
5199460	5201780	he goes towards the sound.
5201820	5202660	Nice.
5204020	5208180	Okay, so just as the other three of you are heading up,
5208180	5212460	you sort of just catch sight in the gloom
5212460	5217060	of Thomas disappearing off the path into the undergrowth
5217060	5218660	and disappearing out of sight.
5218660	5220900	Oh, Thomas, there's stuff out there, I wouldn't...
5220900	5222260	Yeah, that's why I ran,
5222260	5225300	but I think one of the kids is over here.
5225300	5226900	Can you give me a spot hidden, Roy?
5226900	5227900	Wicked scared.
5231780	5234020	23 on a 25.
5234020	5235660	Oh!
5235660	5236500	Nice.
5236500	5239220	So the moon is beginning to come up at this stage,
5239220	5240980	so you've got a bit of light.
5240980	5243900	In the little bit of light you have,
5243900	5248900	you see the form of someone lying just on the ground.
5250420	5252740	You can just make out a human shape.
5252740	5255580	It's too big to be one of the children.
5255580	5258180	It looks like an adult, probably a man.
5258940	5262140	He's lying on the ground and he seems to be trembling
5262140	5263580	and he's still making that sound, that...
5263580	5268260	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
5268260	5270740	I'd like to try to find a stick and poke him.
5270740	5273100	You grab a stick off the ground.
5273100	5278100	It's slightly moist and yeah, you poke him
5278180	5282700	and he doesn't seem to react.
5282700	5285140	I think he's still going, oh, oh, oh.
5285140	5286980	In fact, actually, as you poke him,
5286980	5290260	his head does turn slightly towards you.
5290260	5293060	And as he arrives, we're adjusting to the moon
5293060	5295620	that's now risen a bit more.
5295620	5299340	You can make out some of the contours of his face.
5299340	5301060	His face is quite wasted.
5301060	5305380	He looks really drawn and sick.
5305380	5307780	His eyes are absolutely wide.
5307780	5309660	And as he's staring at you,
5309660	5314660	you see his right eyelid bulge slightly.
5315020	5317700	And then something crawls out from underneath it,
5317700	5322060	something wriggling that's just glinting in the moonlight
5322060	5325420	and crawls across his eyeball and across his face
5325420	5327420	and then just disappears up his nose.
5329340	5332620	I just throw the stick at him and run back to the path.
5332620	5333460	Let's have a sanity roll first.
5333460	5335620	We're gonna find a way to help y'all.
5336980	5338740	So, yeah, sanity roll.
5338740	5340700	Another 23.
5340700	5341540	And your sanity is?
5341540	5343780	On what was my sanity?
5343820	5345740	No, my sanity is 40.
5345740	5348900	And I took, I don't remember how much damage I took, six.
5348900	5350580	So my sanity is 34.
5350580	5351420	So I passed.
5351420	5353420	And so, yeah, I mean, you still, like you say,
5353420	5356060	throw the stick and sort of back off in horror,
5356060	5358340	just almost tumbling over on the ground
5358340	5360220	in your speed to get away.
5360220	5363420	And yeah, as you run through the darkness,
5363420	5365860	through the undergrowth, you can feel
5365860	5370860	sort of the wetness of these strands of weeds
5371860	5374180	as they brush against your face.
5374180	5376460	And you think you can feel things wriggling on them
5376460	5378100	as you brush past them.
5378100	5381660	And then, yeah, you just stumble out onto the track again
5381660	5383500	as the others are there.
5383500	5385500	There's a guy on the trail, off the trail,
5385500	5386540	he's real messed up.
5386540	5391220	Let's get to prospect proper and solve this mystery.
5391220	5392060	What do you think?
5392060	5393180	Does he need medical attention?
5393180	5394140	Do I need to?
5394140	5395060	Not right now.
5395060	5397140	I think we just gotta move on.
5397140	5400140	He's got bugs coming out of his head.
5400140	5404700	I think we gotta find a more holistic solution
5404700	5407860	to this problem before we can help him at all.
5407860	5412300	Well, prospect itself is just 20 yards
5412300	5414300	further up the track from here.
5414300	5416540	As I said, though, there in the moonlight,
5416540	5419580	you can see that there are a couple of outbuildings.
5419580	5422740	Well, first of all, let's just make clear,
5422740	5425620	there is no artificial light here whatsoever.
5425620	5428060	The only light you have is the moonlight.
5429060	5434060	Prospect itself is a fairly big sort of neocolonial house.
5435780	5439420	It looks like there's the remains of a sort of
5439420	5443260	extensional wing on the far side of it from here.
5443260	5446660	The front door looks like it's a jar,
5446660	5450660	but off to the side, there are a few outbuildings.
5450660	5452580	There are some things that look like sheds,
5452580	5454660	albeit large sheds,
5454660	5457340	but there's another building that's a bit odder than that.
5457580	5462140	It's a stone building that is around
5462140	5465700	maybe about 10 yards in diameter,
5465700	5469220	maybe a bit larger, a one-story building
5469220	5472780	that's just set back to the left of the main building.
5472780	5475100	Are there any vehicles parked anywhere?
5475100	5476380	Not that you can see.
5476380	5478740	Would we have, like, our torches with us?
5478740	5479860	Let's have a group luck roll
5479860	5482220	to see whether you thought to bring them.
5482220	5484980	I'm really sorry I joined back with you guys
5484980	5486940	before you decided to check on that.
5486940	5488340	LAUGHING
5492220	5493060	Oh, no.
5493060	5493900	80.
5495900	5498660	So, no, to be fair,
5498660	5501060	you weren't in your proper state of mind before.
5501060	5503140	It's been a day full of shocks.
5503140	5504980	At this stage, obviously it has occurred to you
5504980	5507500	that it would be a really good idea to have light sources,
5507500	5511340	but your mind just wasn't in that space earlier.
5511340	5512500	Typical Freddy.
5513380	5514660	So full of regret.
5515380	5516220	All right, well...
5516220	5519700	Oh, guys, by the way, this is the prospect.
5519700	5521220	This is where we're going.
5521220	5523140	I forgot to announce when we got here.
5523140	5525940	Thank you so much, Karl Rothstein.
5525940	5526780	Thank you for all your help.
5526780	5528300	I'm so glad we brought you.
5528300	5529220	Jesus fuck.
5529220	5530460	Karl, do you have any idea
5530460	5533660	what that weird round building there might be?
5533660	5536700	Oh, let me think.
5536700	5538620	You think it might be,
5538620	5539780	and not that you ever saw it,
5539780	5544020	but it was something that Dr. Hawkes had talked about,
5544020	5547980	that he was going to build a separate laboratory,
5547980	5551100	and you think that might be it?
5551100	5553420	I mean, it still looks like a fairly unusual building.
5553420	5556900	It doesn't necessarily look like what you'd think for a lab,
5556900	5558740	but maybe that's it.
5558740	5561580	It may be his lab.
5561580	5565580	I remember him talking about building a lab.
5565580	5567740	It looks like it could be that,
5567740	5569460	but I'm turning Irish.
5569460	5570300	I don't know.
5570820	5573340	It's hot, man.
5573340	5574340	It's wicked hot.
5575740	5578060	Being from anywhere these days is difficult.
5578060	5579860	How do you keep a hold of your own identity
5579860	5581100	in a world like this?
5582500	5584980	Should we check out the lab?
5584980	5588540	That might be where equipment is for this.
5588540	5590100	Do you think we should start there?
5590100	5591980	I feel like it's been presented.
5594260	5595340	I think we start there.
5595340	5597460	I think we figure out how to help
5597460	5601140	and try to stop whatever's happening first,
5601140	5604540	because if we find the children first,
5604540	5608820	then we would just be carrying or bringing along children
5608820	5612660	into whatever dangers we might be presented later on.
5612660	5613580	Good point, good point.
5613580	5615140	Speaking of carrying things,
5615140	5617460	shouldn't we carry that guy to the lab?
5617460	5618300	No.
5618300	5619860	The guy from the woods back there?
5619860	5620700	Yeah.
5620700	5621540	No, man.
5621540	5622380	My whole point-
5622380	5624940	The whole idea is to find the shit to help him.
5624940	5626940	And then not have dead weight with us.
5626940	5629660	If it's in the lab, then it saves us a trip.
5629660	5630620	Thanks, Thomas.
5630620	5633140	No, Carl, I don't think we need to drag the guy
5633140	5635580	full of bugs by hand back here.
5635580	5636540	Okay.
5636540	5638420	After we just fled from him and Tara.
5638420	5640460	Let's check out this laboratory.
5640460	5641300	What about you?
5641300	5643380	You're a doctor, don't you have an oath?
5643380	5644740	No, yeah, that's why I asked,
5644740	5646860	but when you said the bugs thing,
5646860	5648420	I've seen what those bugs can do.
5648420	5650460	I'm not touching it until we figure out a way
5650460	5653300	to contain those things more efficiently.
5653300	5654140	Okay.
5654140	5656100	And you're off existence, so.
5656140	5657660	This has nothing to do with me.
5657660	5660020	A phys-iks-ion.
5660020	5660860	You're a doctor.
5660860	5661700	Yeah, you said it right.
5661700	5663380	You said you're a doctor, so.
5663380	5664980	Okay, let's go to the lab.
5664980	5669700	So you walk over to this stone building.
5669700	5673540	Yeah, it's got a fairly heavy iron door on it,
5673540	5677020	black iron door, that again is locked.
5677020	5679780	You can also see that in the moonlight,
5679780	5684780	there are some fairly heavy looking cables,
5684780	5687980	half buried running across the ground,
5687980	5691900	that are running over towards the two shanks.
5691900	5693100	If only we had the shotgun,
5693100	5695060	we could be blasting all these locks.
5696540	5698620	Well, we don't need a shotgun for the locks,
5698620	5701220	but it'd be nice to knock out some of these cables
5701220	5702820	and people.
5702820	5706100	All right, I'm gonna unlock the lock
5706100	5709700	with a 16 on a 70.
5709700	5711100	Oh yeah. Hard success.
5711100	5712260	Okay, yeah, yeah.
5712260	5714100	I mean, this is a bit more of a serious lock.
5714140	5715980	It takes you a minute or two,
5715980	5720980	but even then, you pop it open and yeah, the doors open
5722060	5724780	and inside everything is completely dark.
5724780	5726620	There's no light in here.
5726620	5731020	You can hear towards the back, a sloshing of liquid.
5732020	5734700	There's a strange smell in the air
5734700	5739140	and you can see shapes just all around in the gloom.
5740140	5747140	Life's surreal, in retrospect a dream.
5747140	5753140	Easy times feel less than serene.
5753140	5760140	In the moment it's hard to count your blessings,
5760140	5767140	so we long for days gone past us.
5767140	5776140	Grief and strife, bloody, that's real life.
