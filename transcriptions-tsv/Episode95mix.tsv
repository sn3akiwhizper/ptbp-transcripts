418540	423900	true yeah he engineered it he made it happen he hacked us all and some would argue we're not
423900	431420	recording the podcast yet only if it takes it in are we technically recording the podcast

488060	492780	covering the front door with my gun the last episode i was headphones off for a good portion
492780	497420	at the end so i don't know how things have progressed from there judge ephraim courtland
497500	504460	had gone in after silas kohl who went in handcuffed you haven't heard anything
504460	510540	since i believe you failed some listen world and you have your gun trained at the door jack
510540	518300	pearlman what is the in the words of the name on our zoom call sex icon and probably dead soon
518300	529660	character doing i have a one hp and not much sanity and i believe i failed my first aid
529660	534940	role on myself so i just like oh yeah you hurt yourself i think i hurt myself even more yeah
534940	540220	and i'm just like on the ground i don't i don't with one hp am i able to like do anything or am
540220	547260	i like i'm down on the ground yeah no absolutely because you succeeded on your constitution check
547260	552860	you don't have any mechanical disadvantages toward you currently based on the way that
553500	559660	i like playing this game cool okay good to know i mean if you try to sprint after someone i'll
559660	564860	probably be like hey maybe take a massive negative yes yeah yeah besides that what's professor horse
564860	570940	green doing i don't know where are we yes that is correct that was my question for you
571580	577260	yeah no one answered no i'm covering the door and he's injured outside the door
577260	583500	right yard of this the coal home i think you're also injured next to me no i'm very hurt i know
583500	589900	that but i got a little healing so i'm yes i was i was close to dead no i'm not you just blew the
589900	596700	brains like you just blew the head off of the preacher doctor sheriff bobby custard right but
596700	601580	i didn't see it so i missed the sanity and you're the only one who didn't lose sanity
603340	611020	so horace horace shouts uh by god maybe he'll listen to the law or a man of god where's the
611020	618620	preacher sheriff he just starts reaching around him trying to feel out for the the preacher
618620	623260	sheriff everett is not going to look back but just kind of gesture back to where the body is
623260	628620	you done nailed him you done nailed him and you're gesturing to the back of the wagon where his body
628620	635740	flew but the head is sitting about 10 feet away from horace green on the ground where it landed
635740	643740	with a thump and if you were golfing you would have to fix the divot that the head made when
643740	650300	it landed initially in the dirt horace green vomits good heavens
655900	663340	pearlman's just clinching his his leg and he's just like god damn it but somehow due to his
663340	669180	his sex icon status i think is really powering to stand up because you can't be sexy while you're
669180	673100	bleeding on the ground i thought you're gonna say sitting down or sitting down
675580	683580	zack trust me no one's ever looked sexy sitting in a chair ever or sitting on the ground or
683580	689660	laying down has anyone ever been sexy laying in a bed i'm looking at five really sexy dudes
689660	696620	sitting in chairs right now we should record the show standing maybe oh no i think the vibe change
696940	702140	the people couldn't handle that there'd be way too much chaotic energy happening if
702140	706060	i we weren't bound to our chairs over each other more sorry i stood for a second
709500	716460	god damn it i i have to download these files luke no you don't you literally don't like it's not a
716460	721980	rule that you have to look at what luke sends us over the chat while we're recording minions
721980	727420	pornography it's true it's it's not a rule but luke if you want people to look at them you need
727420	730780	to send a link or something because these make you download the file and i'm not gonna do that
730780	736940	he doesn't have a headphone on he does not have a headphone oh god damn it he's just being a little
736940	744460	terrorist throwing bombs into the session okay exactly i'll text him and let him know stop it

785820	791740	calling that yeah when we started birding to get him to come back he blew the smoke directly into
791740	798140	the camera i've always thought of uh thought of it as asking um them to fly away home oh like
798140	802540	come back to their home like that movie i didn't see hey guys check the links i sent on the zoom

921740	930380	humans all right everybody else taking their headphones off so judge ephraim courtland having
930380	939260	just been removed from his own body and replaced with mary mary cole you are in the bedroom silas
939260	946780	coal is still handcuffed he was hiding behind a turned over bed however now he is uh still behind
946780	954860	the bed and still in handcuffs but he's not cowering in fear he's now crouching in concentration
954860	963020	focusing deeply on the words he is chanting into this disheveled bedroom a beaming light forms on
963020	971820	his lips and a white hot blaze of color begins dripping down viscous and alive and it puddles
971820	979660	beneath silas cole's chanting mouth onto the dusty floor below before flowing gently toward the far
979660	988460	side of the room okay luke you can also see as mary cole there's an oily black substance leaking
988460	996620	from your facial orifices you can kind of feel it like a like a perpetual runny nose and eyes
996620	1005020	and ears and mouth and this squamous eye core seems to almost pull itself down to the ground
1005020	1011340	where this mesmerizing brilliant light has pooled between the two doors of this room
1012300	1018940	the syrup made out of the absence of color that just came out of you begins swirling into its
1018940	1026380	opposite and the two unnatural ungodly glass-forming liquids at first refuse to blend
1026380	1034860	like oil and vinegar but then the most beautiful awe-inspiring color you've ever seen forms from
1034940	1042140	this bond and another equally mind-shattering color joins it and another and another and now
1042140	1048140	the old wooden floor on the far side of this bedroom between the only two doors
1048140	1054380	is covered jam to jam with a perversely extraordinary technicolor portal
1054540	1068060	right so i'm gonna go over and take the handcuffs off of silas look at him and be like okay i'm gonna
1068060	1076220	lead him in here just be ready for him wide-eyed silas is just nodding uh ephraim steps over the
1076220	1082140	portal carefully and opens the door shuts it behind him and as he enters back into the living
1082140	1086700	room are you going the living room or the back door do the doors open in to where the portals
1086700	1093820	are or out they open in cool good okay so i'll shut the that door behind me and then

1187020	1194220	as ever at pace and jack promen have their guns set on the front door and professor horace green
1194220	1203100	is horrifyingly staring at the head of pastor sheriff preacher doctor pastored preacher
1203340	1208940	doctor pastored preacher sheriff doctor bobby custard which is on the ground about 10 feet
1208940	1215260	away from him judge ephran courtland as you walk out you see that head just sitting on the ground
1215980	1223740	and you do not see the body blood is everywhere and the three of these men
1223740	1229820	are the only ones out here you no longer find the wild crazed teenager
1230460	1239740	like one of those teenagers at one of those concerts that you might find just wild smoking
1239740	1245180	reaper oh my god can you even imagine that's probably what made her this way every every uh
1245180	1250380	jumps and it almost shoots but oh it's judge horace sees its judge and shoots
1253020	1258460	i come outside and look and see the head and i just look at them like what
1258860	1266540	what what happened horace is slowly crawling like in amazement towards the head well yeah
1266540	1270460	we had we had we had a little accident out here what's what's going on in there did you get did
1270460	1279980	you get silas well yeah in a way um i got him we cut he ran in there cuffed up and uh you know
1279980	1287020	there's some stuff in that front room y'all probably need to see and and i got him back in
1287020	1293980	one of the one of the other rooms but ephraim what happened out here what's got you so shaken
1293980	1302060	up he takes a long drag from the flask that is in his jacket pocket i think you just need to
1302060	1310300	come see it horace horace i walk over to horace horace has reached uh has reached the head
1311100	1316620	and he's just grabbed it by the hair and he's looking it in the eyes horace now i know you
1316700	1321180	ain't much for fighting but sometimes things just happen in battle you can't you can't always
1321180	1325980	predict it i've been in plenty of bar fights where i accidentally punched some fellers i
1325980	1330540	didn't mean to and when you throw guns in the mix you just know you're asking for trouble it ain't
1330540	1336860	your fault so just to if you could if you could put the head down and and we might need you in
1336860	1343260	here but there's there's things happening so if you put it down of of course of course we're
1343260	1347340	needed inside and he takes he doesn't put the head down he carries it with him
1351180	1352860	it's right through here boys
1355100	1358140	excuse me right through here
1361100	1367420	and i just kind of point to the first room inside i'll carefully start dottering up but i want to
1367420	1372060	keep my gun kind of at the ready i'm not pointing at anything in particular but i could if i needed
1372060	1377580	to and i'm cautious about it all every night doing so hot if you want to take lead i'll back
1377580	1384300	you up though as i'm i assume i'm like dripping blood all over the place at this point 100
1384300	1389980	professor horace green is also dripping blood from the head he's carrying are you carrying it
1389980	1395820	with you into the home with two hands or by the hair with one hand or you buy the hair with one
1395820	1406060	hand uh-huh why just curious uh horace green doesn't he doesn't hear that question
1408060	1414620	no yeah i'm asking thomas i guess what's going on inside professor horace green's
1414620	1417980	mind well it's because this is a comedy podcast and that's hilarious
1417980	1427020	yeah i don't know why you're slowing it down like this sack
1427020	1430460	oh i was thinking that we could have like a good character moment
1430460	1432780	you're you're interrupting a good character moment
1436140	1438940	he's dazed carrying a head around and not saying anything
1440460	1445420	he's busy downloading my pictures of wasniac that won't make sense because i'll have edited
1447980	1458620	it as the three of you head in specifically horace green uh the smell of rotten flesh
1459500	1466460	is the first thing you notice as you pass through the swinging open front door of the whole abode
1466460	1472460	at first you think the stench could be from the unattended dishes strewn throughout this living
1472540	1480700	room the remnants of several meals now covered in a few buzzing flies but that static hum of flies
1480700	1487980	it's so loud in your ears and looking over you see that that is due to the large swarm hovering
1487980	1494700	about the body of miss kitty which is laying lifeless across one of the sitting chairs
1495340	1502780	lifeless to be sure because this body the skin is chewed up so badly that chunks are hanging off
1502780	1511740	or completely missing and the dripping dark red blood pooling below on the floor but especially
1511740	1520860	lifeless due to the way this body is crumpled her back held directly in the middle by one of
1520860	1529740	the armrests there's an unnatural angle there as the top half of her torso dangles straight down

1630620	1636060	delta green let's get weird with it but he would be emotionally devastated exactly that's all i
1636060	1642220	wanted you to say earlier so okay hold on hold on hold on real quick hold on roll sanity you said
1642300	1647020	88 that's a critical failure

1661020	1667820	so
1676300	1683340	horse green jack pearlman judge ephraim courtland the three of you hear a slight murmur
1683340	1685820	from the next room deeper into this house
1691980	1702620	bob he's oh i chased him in there and he's uh tied up but he's been yet just saying those
1702620	1709020	mumble words over and over again which room's he in do we know a bob the one that you got
1709020	1715580	right there horace holds the head up and looks at it quizzically i don't think he'll like this
1716220	1719660	this is the first time ever he's noticed that you've brought the head in with you
1719660	1724220	what the hell you why are you holding up the head you should have just left that outside what
1724220	1729900	are you why'd you bring a head in it what's going on here horse so he can see he's dead horse he's
1729900	1738140	dead he killed him okay professor horse green starts laughing no no no yeah no he doesn't
1739100	1745340	horace looks really confused and he looks at you and he looks at the head and then he moves the
1745340	1752300	jaw holy shit and he's like i'm not dead oh my god
1754940	1761340	ever ever exchanges a glance with like jack pearlman but it's not of like scared it's just
1761340	1772460	like well we lost one i guess uh jack just shrugs yep you're getting the floors dirty with all that
1772460	1778940	blood there i don't horse if you could put a napkin under bobby that would be he's dripping
1778940	1786380	he's causing me oh my oh my how how rude and horace takes off his um his handkerchief and
1786380	1793740	ties it around the stump on the neck i don't think you're gonna be making much more of a mess
1793740	1798540	that's already in here those other two rooms ain't too ain't too good either well it ain't
1798540	1807900	proper for a head not to be covered on the bottom i think he's quite dashing now aren't you yes i am
1811500	1819260	why are you all looking at me like that maybe we should continue upon our our our business here and
1819260	1825740	talk to horace about some stuff later yeah well if we i think i hear him still chanting in there but
1826540	1834300	uh he's just passed in through those doors what did you do to him i just i got him
1834300	1843900	beat up pretty good and i got him hogtied and and and cuffed up and he's just i don't know i might
1843900	1848460	have hit him in the head too hard or something what do you reckon he killed his kitty for i i
1848460	1854140	didn't really have time to find out i just kind of lost it on him and then uh came to see what
1854140	1860620	you guys were doing i'm you know didn't want to do it alone you think maybe she was breaking into
1860620	1864460	his house last night and that's he must have caught her that's that's got to be what happened
1864460	1869660	could be why to keep her inside though he didn't he didn't mention her back at the at the church
1869660	1873420	seems like that something he would have never liked silas maybe he stole something from her
1873420	1880460	like he stole something from me but what do you think happened teddy i think the zombie girl
1880460	1888220	later oh well now that's a thought perhaps what do you guys think maybe we ought to just go ask
1888220	1894220	him yeah i think it's best we talk to silas cole face to face right man figure this all out if you
1894220	1899740	want to lead the way go ahead because i feel like i'm gonna lose it on him again if i go in there
1899740	1906060	first and can't promise he'll have much to say after i get to him any of us check if mary's here
1906060	1912860	mary mary upstairs do i hear any response from upstairs there is no upstairs so probably i don't
1912860	1921100	then roll sanity wait wait wait wait if we roll can we make there an upstairs you said we could
1921100	1927020	roll stealth for rocks can we roll listen for upstairs it's a 40 story skyscraper i don't have

1953020	1958140	i didn't see anybody else sad's kitty and silas when i came in where you reckon mary's off to you
1958700	1963660	i don't rightly know and i head towards the first door and just kind of

2055500	2060620	too high contact every flip through to one of those like shitty alternative sports channels
2060620	2066780	and they're showing cornhole tournaments and it's just like it's more like a dad bod tournament
2067660	2074620	it's like who can be the roundest like right in the middle yeah they got really thin calves
2075820	2083100	real thin everything except for except for the perfect beer belly and their corn arm their corn
2083100	2088300	arm yeah how about the five of us challenge the five best cornhole players in america
2088300	2094300	to a game of cornhole um to promote our podcast and the losers have to live on moron mountain
2094300	2100540	forever yeah yeah you need to say you don't like the idea with swack hammer as their boss
2101260	2104220	it's a there's a space jam ref so uh

2147340	2154380	towering behemoth man is because of my horse riding capabilities you've adopted the way of
2154380	2161180	the horse for your legs you've got very thin calves in my free time i run around my house
2161180	2171020	on all fours and jump over stuff oh god oh how horrifying to imagine a man in the 1880s
2171740	2181500	uh-huh specifically just barely yeah he burns down three houses a year with all the oil lamps
2185020	2190540	silas cole saved you a lot of money why are you after him he stole my damn wire
2193020	2195020	i can't prance around like i used to
2195020	2202940	do life went back to the dark ways pace begins hobbling toward the door that courtland
2202940	2211180	has just opened up and it is jack pearlman's turn what would you like to do uh what do i see
2211180	2216060	where are you going i was following ever at pace uh you could easily pass him if you would like
2216060	2221260	or you can continue to walk behind him i'll still stay behind him with my gun kind of tracked on the
2221260	2230380	door so i'm trailing him i'm letting it is your turn i uh sorry finish that thought oh me yeah
2230380	2235740	i stood up for a second that's my oh that's cool i'm gonna stand up more now you big bully
2237980	2239580	i don't even remember it was stupid
2241580	2246700	horace isn't going down the hallway uh because he's just also not his turn judge courtland
2247020	2251660	you're in thomas standing up oh shit sorry i'm standing up
2254700	2257820	it seemed like a moment to stand up i was just gonna get one little bit in
2258780	2267180	uh but now zach's all like let's make this a forecast but that was really good no
2269420	2275180	what was that a pun of podcast oh forecast anyway
2277660	2281580	horse green isn't going down the hallway towards the door because he and the skull
2281580	2287180	and the head are just standing there going like after you after you after you after you
2290060	2294220	so i'm like holding the door open for them and i see that and i just kind of like
2295180	2302700	gently grab a horse by the sleeve and like pull him like guide him into the room
2302780	2306460	horse and the skull look at each other and they're like after him
2306460	2308940	and they follow you do they say it at the same time
2311660	2317100	yes they do professor horace green as courtland escorts you past ever at pace and jack pearlman
2317740	2324540	into this room right as you are at the threshold of this door looking down you see hey if uh
2324540	2328940	ever at pace and jack pearlman justin joe if you could take off your headphones real quick
2329180	2331260	as well as luke that would be phenomenal
2341340	2348140	professor horace green as you keep direct eye contact with preacher sheriff doctor
2348140	2355500	detached head bobby custard you notice out of the corner of your peripheral a disturbingly
2355500	2363100	magnificent technicolor swirl of light covering the part of the floor in this room that's
2363100	2370220	immediately in front of you it's likely the most beautiful thing you have ever seen and yet there
2370220	2378060	is an endlessness about it that inspires both awe and dread i need you to roll sanity
2378060	2393420	uh fail um 73 on a 60 you're gonna lose one sanity um horace uh horace walks through the
2393420	2402060	portal horse green with this head in one of your hands you step down into nothingness
2402380	2406860	and immediately you feel content
2410380	2416860	that's all i can say at this time oh dang did i just turn myself into a tilde zombie i can't
2416860	2423340	answer that question currently well a zombie with a zombie with a little head buddy would
2423340	2431500	be really funny it would be very fun all right so you can uh you can leave the zoom call if you
2431500	2437500	want honestly okay i'll stay i mean i'll be by my phone so yeah you can hang out on the zoom call
2437500	2442380	but stay by your phone and oh yeah i'll just watch you guys yeah there you go uh okay
2451420	2457180	ever paste jack pearlman judge ephraim courtland the three of you see professor horace green walk
2457180	2465020	into the room however you are at a current angle where you are right now walking towards this door
2465020	2470620	to where you can't quite see where he went once he got into the room and you can't really see
2470620	2478300	into the room quite yet into the next room where silas is exactly okay and ever at pace it is your
2478300	2487660	turn the fact that we're in turn order would make joe nervous but ever it's just walking in to see
2487660	2494620	where judge ephraim courtland tied up silas i think ever pace would be nervous due to the odd
2494620	2502380	chanting that you can now hear coming from this room that you know is silas cole who is apparently
2502380	2510940	tied up hogtied uh who is saying bob da hahaha bob da hahaha bob da hahaha and with the door
2510940	2516220	open you can hear it quite clearly and there's that body that was all munched up on i kind of
2516220	2522220	stop when i hear wait what oh the miss kitty you mean yeah yeah there's reasons to be uh nervous
2523260	2528380	not forever namely everything that's just a chewed up body ain't nothing here now found
2528380	2536300	miss kitty she's dead that sucks so it goes but mission accomplished he hears uh he hears the
2536300	2541260	chanting and stops and listens for a second and kind of looks back at judge and pearlman
2542220	2547820	bob da hahaha ring a bell for anybody bob da hahaha is he is he in town you think he's a relation
2547820	2552620	or something maybe it's his lawyer he needs his lawyer bob da hahaha maybe i i don't know judge
2552620	2557900	is there a is there a lawyer in town bob da hahaha i think i've dealt with him once or twice
2558460	2562380	that's what it is he's gonna need a good lawyer for this one and i keep walking in
2565580	2568860	uh yeah justin and luke take off your headphones real quick for me
2578140	2586140	joe as you walk toward the open door you see a technicolor swirl has taken over the entirety
2586140	2593740	of the floor right is you where you're about to walk in on i need you to roll a sanity check as
2593740	2601980	all of these rainbow colors just wash back and forth in a circle around where your next step
2601980	2610620	might be i pass a 16 on a 78 you lose no sanity ever wants to look up at the ceiling to see what's
2610620	2616540	projecting this down onto the floor there's nothing up on the ceiling that would affect
2617100	2621100	what is happening here on the floor does anything change with my step
2621820	2626700	like into like onto it do you step onto it i thought you said i did you don't have to
2628780	2635020	well fuck i think i think since he didn't pass a since he passed a sanity role he doesn't he's
2635020	2639020	not too worried about it he just thinks that a pretty light show going on in here somehow
2639020	2644860	there must be a stained glass revolving uh candle lit thing and as that first step goes down you
2644860	2652700	feel your foot continue to move through the floor as ever it pays trips and falls face first into
2652700	2661980	this technicolor swirl and you feel your body become wholly content in this moment welcome
2661980	2671660	evert professor horace green says to you in a space of pure darkness and somehow at the same
2671660	2686220	time completely technicolor welcome evert horse is that you yes eddie's here too oh you you
2686220	2692780	brought the you brought the head with you too all right where are we who cares doesn't it feel great
2693900	2702460	yeah i mean i don't know if i ever experienced a time when i was so it just it's relaxing i guess
2702460	2707980	and the two of you are just falling but you're falling up seemingly you reckon you think we're
2707980	2713020	on our way up to the big man in the sky i think that's probably what this is what do you think
2713020	2716620	happened you think we we must have stepped in a bear trap got us got us through an artery or
2716620	2722220	something in that room to me it looked like a beautiful gateway to an ascendant plane
2722220	2727100	that's what i saw too that must have been the last drags of the blood leaving our body and
2727100	2732460	making our brains see the something that would give us comfort in our final moments evert uh
2733100	2741100	normally i'm a man of of reason and science but uh well science never made me feel like this
2741100	2747660	i think probably we just yeah we died you're right yep we died don't question it we're going
2747660	2756620	to heaven this is great uh just enjoy this this falling upwards as it were clara here i come
2756620	2763980	and above you you see only darkness it'll take me a minute i don't even see the light yet but
2763980	2780220	i'll be there jack promen yeah hey man hey it's your turn uh i'm following evert into the into the
2780220	2787260	thing gun out and as you walk up to the door that is slightly open that both professor horse green
2787260	2796540	and evert pace have walked through you see on the floor an incredible swirl of technicolor
2796540	2804460	vibrancy just washing about in circles around and around the floor and i need you to roll sanity for
2804460	2811420	me but it's so party it is but it is crazy as hell oh 51 yeah on a 39 it'd be cool if i could
2811420	2816140	pass one sanity check well with a failed sanity check
2818780	2824060	you're going to be at a negative depending on what you want to do here okay but looking into
2824060	2830060	this room uh you just see the majority of this floor about half the room is covered in this
2830060	2839020	gorgeous rainbow colored swirl like light that is mesmerizing light like bioluminescence or whatever
2839020	2845580	you do not see ever at pace you do not see professor horse green you only see
2845580	2850220	a bed that is flipped over and from behind it you hear
2852380	2860300	silas what the hell are you chanting that for who's bob to hob and i guess i'll have you roll
2860300	2869980	a dexterity at a negative 20 to keep your footing as you enter into this room negative 20 because
2869980	2876940	you failed you're saying fuck 29 on a 25 so close that'll do it as you uh
2879740	2886220	as your foot steps into this room without being able to make the jump
2886780	2893980	over it or stop yourself from stepping onto it your foot moves through the floor
2894940	2904940	and you begin falling through this technicolor swirl of a portal and you begin falling upward
2904940	2914940	and upward and you feel completely content physically oh that sounds nice except for
2914940	2920460	the part where i'm in an endless hell of some kind yes it is complete darkness and at the
2920460	2927340	exact same time every color you've ever seen swirling around you and above you there's nothing
2927340	2933580	but the absence of light and the bodies of ever at pace and professor horse green who are having
2933580	2940220	a perfectly normal conversation oh shit jack did the bear trap get you too we just all plumb ran
2940220	2947180	into it didn't we hello jack um long story short we're probably in heaven uh i don't want to get
2947180	2951500	too into it because we're probably gonna have to do this again with the judge really quickly here
2951500	2957340	so uh but if you could if if you can just wait if you could just wait wait we're gonna get to
2957340	2968540	it in just a moment i'm sure we'll answer all your questions and you wait and you wait
2970860	2976300	and the judge does not come oh thank god the judge must have skipped over that bear trap in
2976300	2982380	that room kind of bear trap sends you into another goddamn i guess it could have been some kind of
2982380	2986220	trap that fell from the ceiling but either way something killed us as soon as we walked in the
