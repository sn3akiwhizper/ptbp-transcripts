0	2000	What's everybody do?
3680	9000	Keep going. Oh boy. My name is Zach and this is pretending to be people
9000	14900	We are a role-playing podcast and we are playing the game Delta green, but it's not really Delta green
14900	21260	It's an amalgamation that we have come up with that is a mixture of the role-playing systems Delta green and pulp
21560	24600	Cthulhu with all that nerdy shit out of the way for the rest of you listening
24720	30920	This is a collaborative storytelling experience that you will be listening to over the coming weeks
30920	34760	I am here with Joe. Hey, I'm Joe Luke. I'm Luke and Thomas
34760	40240	I'm Thomas having heard many stories from other DMS GM's out there. I
40720	42520	consider myself to be
42520	48680	Extremely lucky with the group that I have been blessed with as a player same same same
48680	53160	We have been playing together for three years now. This is our third campaign
53160	60920	We ran two ten-month-long Delta green campaigns where we played weekly and we've kept the exact same group ever since I
61000	65760	Am fully in love with this game Thomas. What's your experience with role-playing?
65760	68680	I started with D&D like a lot of people and
69240	72880	Wanted something a little more story based and less mechanics driven
72880	78120	I didn't like sitting around for 30 minutes while the wizard took his turn. So Delta green was perfect for that
78120	86200	It's all about character interaction and like solving this mystery together and combats are very like combat is very simple quick and rare and rare
86200	90120	Yeah, and violently, you know, you're shooting guns at each other. It ends it gets over with quickly
90120	94760	Like you said we've been playing together for the past few years. That's been the highlight of my week that whole time
94760	102400	I'm Luke my role-playing experience in high school. I played Dungeons Dragons twice the group that I played with
102720	107080	Didn't take it very seriously and our DM took it very seriously
107120	109480	So we were not invited back to play
110120	117760	and then after that the next time I played was Delta green with Zach and Thomas and a couple other people and yeah, I
118160	122080	Loved it. I've pretty much constantly been playing it since I
122560	127920	Started playing with this group Thomas actually texted me kind of out of the blue one day about wanting to do
128440	133200	D&D game with some mutual friends of ours and I I think unbeknownst to him
133200	138640	I had already been kind of wanting that I had been listening to podcasts and watching shows on Twitch and things like that
138640	139480	So we did it
139480	143880	It was it was awesome to have that all of a sudden pop up that group didn't last for very long
143880	149480	But pretty quickly after that dissolved Thomas again asked if I wanted to join you guys and I said fuck
149480	154520	Yeah, and you guys seem to like me so I stuck around we were big fans. You brought an element of
155080	157080	seriousness to our table
158600	163040	Much needed that had not existed there before I remember the
163200	167760	Very first time that you role-played with us you were playing Taylor my wife's partner
167760	172160	Yeah, you gave me a couple options for characters and I picked the FBI agent. Yeah, I'd seen X-Files
173520	178180	And then we had one of our best sessions to date right then and there it was amazing
178180	183960	I don't he brought the energy for sure. I'd never met Joe before I played with him now. I see him every week
183960	184640	Hey, baby
184640	190640	I hope that you guys become our best friends the way that I have become best friends with my role-playing group
190680	197440	As we wiggle our way into your ear holes each week, please also invite us into your hearts and to your parties
197440	201920	Yeah, invite us to your parties by a spear. We really like drinking drinking
202760	207600	Marijuana. Yep, if you're offering are you offering are you offering? Hey internet listener?
208600	215920	Are you holding PO box? I think it's worth mentioning that Zach created all of this stuff. We don't know anything that's happening
215920	218620	We try to not talk about it too much outside of the game
218840	221620	We really want to be surprised by each other and by Zach
221620	228560	Yeah, and actually one of my favorite things about this group is as we've come to play together for longer periods of time
228560	233880	We've kind of talked and you guys have given me full reign to fuck over your characters
233880	240000	Which is a very fun thing to give your DM the right to do and I try to take full advantage of that
240000	245640	There are a couple parts per episode where I will have written the description of a character or the description of a place
245640	251600	But outside of that everything is improv. It is also a closed game. Oh, that's a really good point Luke
251600	253160	So we play a closed game
253160	258600	so anytime one of these characters goes off on their own the player also sits in the room with
258720	264120	Just me and we go through what happens that way the players can keep secrets from each other
264120	269280	It's like secrets and lies the name of the game that continues outside the podcast, too
269280	272080	We try not to talk to each other about what's going on in the game too much
276560	277800	It's
277800	284520	Kind of scary. It's kind of violent. Oh, yeah, this is a horror mystery. Yeah, this is a horror mystery graphic content warning
284520	289100	You may see there is an explicit tag on all of our episodes
289100	292260	This isn't just because we use the fuck word
292260	298120	It's also because a lot of the descriptions within the story are going to be gruesome and brutal with
298280	303760	Hopefully a lot of comedy and come for the heart stay for the gore come on the heart stick it to the door
304200	308760	Come on the door come on the heart to in the stink it gets a lot worse than just shooting people
308760	316040	Yeah, it can be pretty icky icky, but don't worry. We bring enough warmth and humanity and humor and humor hopefully humor
316040	317080	We hope you think it's funny
317080	323460	So we got together and we created a small town together that this story would take place in
323840	329440	Contention contention is the name of this fictional town in this fictional universe that is based
329800	336180	Loosely on our own world people could easily relate this to x-files or
336920	341600	Season 1 of true detective pretty much anything that has a creepy supernatural
342040	346080	Ambiance to it, but we're also going to try like to keep it funny
347800	355920	Like that case in point with awesome Twilight jokes just fucking constantly we're on the bleeding edge of cultural relevance
356920	358920	We recorded this in
359100	361100	2011
361200	363680	Basically what we've done is we've set up a
364320	370720	Story in which these three guys are playing police officers of this small town of contention
370720	372080	We did this for a couple reasons
372080	378760	It's an easy way to get them involved in a mystery within their small town and have the power and the free time
378960	385200	To look into said mystery very excited to have our friend Justin involved in this podcast
385520	391840	He will be the first voice that you hear as Justin is playing wolf the dog the a.m
391840	396200	radio DJ in the town of contention who will be our narrator and
396680	404240	Introduce each episode. He is also responsible for creating the original music that you will hear backing this
404520	411080	Podcast Justin did all of our music except for the intro except for the intro which was done by kudzu a band from our
411080	416880	Hometown of Springfield, Missouri kudzu. You look them up on bandcamp. Thank you kudzu. Thank you kudzu
416920	419740	We also record it in the nude. You should know that
420560	426880	Hot room hot room sweaty. That's why we take our covered in molasses for sustenance
428240	435260	But we have a very very specific rule. You're not allowed to eat your own molasses. No only only your friends molasses
435260	442460	Yeah, we eat molasses. So thanks everyone for downloading and listening to our first episode of pretending to be people
442460	444500	We hope that you continue to listen now
444580	451660	Let's get that a.m. Dial in position to six nine four point two and hand it over to wolf the dog
451860	459860	What's up, my babies? It's wolf the dog coming at you from six nine four point two PT BP contentions newest and
460780	461620	Only
461620	467780	Radio station some of you surrounding listeners might not know contention like we all do here

471600	477380	Now the date on this here calendar says it's December 1st. And let me tell you it's a warm one out there

777620	783700	Well, our story does begin on an unseasonably warm December 1st in a small town called contention
783980	788160	Thin mist can be seen under the street lights on an empty country road
788820	791200	the inside of the contention police department
791200	798160	However is cozy warm and bright a smiling man sits behind a large secretary desk littered with papers and snack wrappers
798200	804860	He has a round baby face and small teeth and he is wearing a sweater vest over a shirt and tie
805140	811680	This man's phone rings this guy by the way, he's the secretary in the office. He's like the office or his gums big or
812340	818240	Small that was an interesting detail. He's got small teeth, but he's got gums that stick out
818280	824020	I kind of picture him as like like small teeth, but very very healthy gums. Oh, those are some real
824840	832520	You can absolutely see a half to three-quarters of an inch of gum in between teeth on top lip
832520	838860	Yes, it's almost as if his top lip is receding. It's to come into the gum. It's a common occurrence exactly
838860	842140	Yeah, he's wearing a sweater vest over a shirt and tie and his phone rings
842680	847400	Which happens often in the office? We cannot be vaping on mic all the time

1198300	1204300	So she took the box in with her into the drew the office drew. Did you do you know where that box came from?
1204900	1210620	No, I didn't see anything come in. That's really strange. It just it was just here
1210620	1214940	I guess and it was probably right it might have been right and right about at that moment
1214940	1221060	The chief comes walking out of her office and she is completely broken down
1221300	1228100	Tears have clearly been streaming down her face. Her face is red. You've never seen her in this emotional state before Keith
1228100	1230860	What the hell did you get her was not mine. She
1231580	1235740	Immediately walks from her door out of the office
1237260	1239060	Chief
1239060	1243940	Doesn't even pay attention takes off and it's gone. Did she have the box in her hands? No, I
1244780	1250740	Feel really bad. I'm gonna go into her office and see what was in that box. Yeah, you messed up this gift, buddy
1251060	1255020	So when you walk into her office, it's neat. It's like a super
1255860	1257540	office
1257540	1261460	What a cool place. This is great. She keeps saying I want to be
1262340	1268820	Very organized and you look inside this white box and there's no like wrapping or anything
1268820	1273660	Inside of it. There's no paper or anything. I need a tag or anything on it. There's no tag on it
1273660	1278540	There's just three items inside the box. It is a flower. It's a rose. It's a single rose
1278540	1285000	There's a hard hat just like a straight-up normal white hard hat and a black silk bowtie. I want to plop that
1285540	1290220	Hard hat on my head see if it fits it fits cool. I'm gonna put it back on the box
1292340	1294340	Role-playing
1294660	1299780	I'm gonna I'll go back out into the main room and tell them what I saw I come back out
1299780	1301180	I I had the box in my hand
1301180	1306180	I'm like does any of this mean anything to you and I asked the DM does any of that mean anything to me?
1306180	1312700	I don't I don't think any of these things would particularly stick out to you as having any
1313660	1317460	Intrinsical meaning that's a weird collection of things there
1317500	1323300	The phone rings as you guys are talking and drew picks up in his same like nervous hurried voice again
1323340	1329620	He's just like drew a contention PD working at me and he's talking in the background as you guys are talking
1329620	1332060	I wonder what's up with those dogs. I go into the
1332660	1338220	Her office and look in the box and I pick up the tie and I want to see if there's any like is it monogrammed
1338220	1342880	In any way, is there anything on the tag any any sign of any no ownership? Nope
1342880	1348620	Okay, just a very plain black silk bowtie. It's untied drew is on the phone
1348620	1351000	He hangs up and he looks at you guys and he's like
1353300	1355500	Um fellas
1357820	1360780	Somebody found a body out at the junkyard
1362540	1364540	I
1364820	1367660	Think this is an actual emergency you guys I
1370420	1372540	Don't I don't know they hung up immediately
1372620	1379020	she it was a woman's voice and she said that there was a body at the junkyard and that we needed to come out and
1379020	1382660	And look at it immediately and she was she's kind of slurring her words
1383300	1387340	Did you get her name? She just said Julie and then stopped immediately
1388420	1391180	Talking after that and just hung up
1391180	1397700	I don't know what happened, but there was like a I heard something kind of not break
1397700	1404780	But I heard something kind of there was a noise and then she like screamed a little bit after she said her name
1404780	1409700	And and then and then she hung up immediately and you said this out at the junkyard. Yeah
1410060	1412300	Go check it out. Okay, so you guys all have
1413100	1418500	Individual police cars that you can take. Yeah, I can ride together. I think we should all take our own cars
1418500	1419500	Just in case I'm with you
1419500	1425580	I take a pull of my bourbon off the Chiefs desk before I go out. Yeah any complaints from the other two officers?
1425580	1427580	I don't think they see that
1427860	1431680	You do it sneaky. I don't know petty more well enough to reprimand him
1431860	1435340	So I just kind of turn a blind eye to that and okay
1435340	1441340	So the three you'd go ahead and grab that pull off the bottle before you head out and the three of you are going out
1441340	1443940	It's a dark night. I'd say it's pretty nice
1443940	1447860	It actually feels more like fall than it does winter at this point in December 1st
1447860	1452700	But there's like a light mist coming down. So I would say it's real dark out
1452700	1457220	You got the streetlights guiding your way the junkyard sits on the far
1457820	1462220	Southeast corner of town and it's where the old mine was
1462380	1464560	This is an old mining town back in the
1465060	1471520	1800s and the junkyard is out on top of where the the old mine was throwing junk down the shaft
1473300	1475900	That's I mean honestly just filling it up
1475900	1476420	Oh, yeah
1476420	1476820	Yeah
1476820	1482980	and so you guys are gonna drive from downtown out on a few country roads to get out there and
1483100	1485100	So supposed to be anyone
1486100	1488100	Throwing the junk down the shaft
1489100	1493120	That's actually their the motto of the junkyard. It says that on the sign
1494980	1499820	Shaft shaft rowers piston junkyard shaft throwers. We can do better
1501380	1503380	Let's return to that
1503920	1507340	So you guys are driving out there it's night as you're going out there
1507340	1512700	There is a car coming from the other direction that is flying going
1513220	1518660	Maybe double the speed limit. It's probably 45 out here and this car is going 80 90 miles an hour
1518660	1522300	What is our order Clark's Clark's very first? Okay
1522300	1528300	Well, I'll be second because you were busy taking a pull your bourbon before you hopped in the car. So it takes so long
1528540	1531100	Yeah, drink. Yeah. Yeah, you've savors it
1533180	1535180	Swash it around
1536300	1538580	Jim this was a $13
1538580	1540580	Dollar
1541660	1545560	B-mate is that the good stuff for John Lee anymore? Appreciate every sit tin high
1548420	1551580	What's out there but $13 $13, okay
1551580	1556100	So the three of you are driving down this road in this car flies by you as anyone pulling off
1556100	1560140	Are you gonna get on the radio and say who's gonna take care of that? Yeah, I'll get that. Okay
1560140	1562140	I want to see a dead body
1564060	1566860	Go get him kid, so Keith Vigna and
1567300	1568540	Clark Bishop
1568540	1571020	Continue on to the junkyard and John Lee Pettymore
1571380	1577740	Turns his car around and I immediately if the lights weren't on I assume that they are on now and you're in chase mode
1578140	1582320	So go ahead and roll me a drive check
1582700	1587940	Thomas to see if John Lee Pettymore can catch up and successfully pull over this car
1588220	1593440	All right, John Lee Pettymore. What's your drive in his younger? He's got a pretty good drive 70
1593440	1599240	Oh nice, he used to drive World of Outlaw sprint cars. Hell yes plays a lot of Forza Oh
1601400	1608560	20 nice nice. So you just flip it around and immediately are on the tail of this car. It looks pretty cool
1608560	1614760	It does the car is slightly swerving and also still going probably 80 miles an hour
1614760	1620000	But she is about to hit more into the town and less of a country road
1620000	1624040	You're gonna go ahead and want to pull her over as soon as possible. I do that nice
1624160	1628520	So go ahead and roll luck for me. Yeah, what did I put those dice with?
1628520	1633640	Let's keep those dice at least those percent. We're playing percentage dies. Oh
1634400	1640040	Not only okay 55 on a 50. So this is a great way to describe how this game works
1640040	1646800	So he had a 70% and drive drive being the skill and he rolled a 20 which is a success
1646800	1652120	So you want to roll underneath your score if he rolled a 22 with the tens dice matching
1652120	1654160	That would be a critical success
1654160	1660540	And then if you roll above your skill, which just happened which just happened
1660540	1667280	It's a failure because your luck is 50, right? Yep, and he rolled a 55 which the dice match and it's above
1667280	1673000	Which means it is a real fail the car in front of you loses control and immediately
1673440	1675760	Crashes into a telephone pole
1676280	1681840	Smashes at 80 miles an hour into it. Oh fuck and you with that drive
1683780	1690520	Can pull over however you want to so are you going alongside in front of behind like how are you pulling up on this?
1690520	1693440	Her car just smashed into a telephone smashed into a telephone pole
1693440	1700500	I pull off right in front of it and I run and make sure she's all right, but the driver is all right
1701500	1705580	Whoo-hoo-hoo as you get there you see that the windshield is
1705980	1711320	Completely smashed open and there's no one sitting in the driver's seat. Fuck. All right. Okay, I get out my flashlight
1711320	1714020	Oh, I don't have to I don't have to have an accent when I'm describing my
1715620	1720340	Pull out my flashlight I get out my flashlight. Yeah, I immediately start searching the area
1720340	1724740	I'm looking for you know, it's it's very clear. She is like was she thrown
1724740	1728820	She was thrown clear of the vehicle and she is alive
1728820	1733180	You can actually hear her like screaming and moaning about 20 yards away
1734180	1736180	Woof. Yeah. Yikes
1741180	1744420	I'm glad I had some bourbon. It honestly sounds like an animal dying
1744420	1750900	I call the county hospital immediately to get an ambulance out here. You can already hear the ambulance. I rush to
1752540	1756880	These guys are good. They're very good at their job. I rush over to her and see what I can do
1756880	1760300	Okay, roll medical check of some sort gonna have to be
1761720	1765720	I've got no medicine skills and I have 10% first aid. Yeah
1767120	1770100	That's a fail on the first day. Oh, yeah, she looks great
1770880	1775860	No, I don't see anything wrong here. Why are you crying?
1782020	1784180	Ma'am stop resisting
1784180	1786180	Her
1786500	1788500	Face is split wide open
1788780	1795940	And she's bleeding profusely and you have absolutely no idea how to stop bleeding of the face sure as hell
1795940	1799140	Don't cutting to the two of you who went out to the junkyard
1799220	1805900	You guys pull up and the headlights are shining through an old rusty chain link fence and through the end of the fence
1805900	1809240	You see at the end of the lights reach of your headlights
1809260	1816880	The ground is splattered with blood and a lifeless body is crumpled on the moist dirt about 20 yards past the fence
1816880	1818780	inside this junkyard is
1818780	1823320	The gate locked to the gate is locked. Is there barbed wire? There is barbed wire
1823320	1829360	Oh, I was gonna climb over but I got better since than that plus my big bridges if I get caught on the bar
1830440	1832440	Bet you guys have some cutters
1832640	1838540	Yeah, well, hey, shut up Thomas. You're not there. Can we can we get a hold of who owns this place?
1838940	1846180	The Pistons this is the piston junkyard and the NBA team. Yep, the Detroit pistons. Hey Clark
1846980	1853100	Junkyard and content. What's big boss pistons name? So you would know it's two brothers who run the piston family
1853500	1856980	Leo and George and they are the piston brothers
1856980	1860940	I think that Clark Bishop would know these two from back in the day Clark
1860940	1866240	You got Leo or George's phone number, uh, you can probably get a hold of Leo sure do
1866240	1869080	Okay, give him a call come have him unlock this
1869080	1872840	I don't have to cut through if we don't need to but let him know it's a serious situation
1872840	1879680	Yeah, I'll give him a call the phone rings like six times before there's a click and then you just hear this
1889120	1894920	Leo hey Leo. Hey. Hey. Hey, it's it's Clark Clark. Hey
1895760	1899040	We've got a situation up here at your yard Clark who?
1899900	1903340	Bishop with the contingent PD, you know me Leo
1904400	1906800	We've got kind of a thing going on up here at your yard
1906800	1911680	We need to we need you to come down here and let us in in the pig farm. No your junkyard. Oh
1912720	1914720	Okay. Well, uh
1915320	1917320	I'm busy
1917480	1924000	I'm bit Leah, you know, I wouldn't call you if it wasn't important. There's there's something there's uh, there's something real bad might happen
1925600	1930680	Okay, I'll get my keys and I'll be down in a second. All right. Thanks, man. Okay
1931320	1933280	So a old truck pulls up
1933280	1939200	It's like a beat-to-death old truck probably from like the 50s and it seems like it was taken care of for a long time
1939200	1941200	But hasn't been taken care of recently
1941560	1944040	Rust is starting to grow on it
1945300	1951780	He pulls up and a large man in overalls covered in pig shit gets out
1952780	1954780	You know kind of
1955700	1960900	waddling I guess is the right word towards you guys and he's got this big circle ring of
1961340	1966340	Keys that he's already like in the darkness trying to thumb through trying to find the right one
1966900	1971860	Clark I was busy, but you know, you're you I like to keep you guys
1971860	1976860	I'll be down here any time that you need. I'm just like to be a good citizen
1977580	1982400	We know Leo we know we we're not making fun of this guy's mental health are we no
1983580	1985580	Definitely. This is what he sounds like
1986180	1989940	This is a character voice that I have chosen for this man
1989940	1994980	and just because he's not that smart and has a thick accent doesn't mean that he's not a
1995420	1997420	fully fleshed out
1997740	2002420	Character and a human being we love and we love and respect
2003020	2005020	Hey Leo, do you?
2005980	2007980	Leo when's the last time you were?
2017820	2025220	Cut it at Thomas's mic when he's not in the room and Leo when's the last time you were here I had to come by to
2025220	2027220	sweep up
2028300	2032940	Two weeks ago, you haven't been here for two weeks. It's George was George here today
2033020	2037900	Nobody comes out of here ain't nobody jumps anything anymore. Is it just you and your brother who have keys to this here?

2045940	2050580	All right. Well if you can go ahead and open up this gate, I I don't know if you can't
2051700	2057260	I don't know if you've noticed this but if you take a peek over there, I think you can see why it's such a serious situation
2057940	2059220	Oh
2059220	2061220	Is that it? Yeah
2061860	2068200	Well, I didn't this wasn't me like I didn't I don't know you are the prime suspect right now
2076300	2080300	He's so scared like looking in his eyes he is the scariest boy I
2081060	2084340	Slap him on the shoulder. I said, I'm just kidding. You haven't been here in two weeks
2084340	2089260	He drops his keys and he's like picks him back up. He's trying to fumble with him and he's like, okay
2089260	2094300	It's this one and he goes over and he unlocks the gate. Can I go home now? Yeah, okay
2094820	2099100	Did he leave the could you leave that key here for us and we can get back to you tomorrow?

2106340	2112020	Okay, I'm gonna go home now. Yeah, I think we would have I'm not here, but I don't think we would have any further questions

2253440	2255440	splattered in a circular
2255520	2258820	Range around this body in every direction
2258980	2263400	So it looks like this body was thrown here or dropped here
2263400	2268480	Is there any footprints or anything around or does it look like it just became here it?
2270520	2275680	Looking around though. The ground is wet a little bit. It's like the ground is the ground is moist and
2277120	2281000	There there are no footprints in the area except for your own
2281000	2287360	So it is it is since it's like damp or whatever it would I would be able to notice footprints if they yeah
2287360	2293400	I think so. Okay, I return with the lights on the camera and I go ahead and set up some good floodlights on the area
2293400	2297600	Yeah, and start just taking. Yeah, let's take some pictures before we move this body for
2298440	2302400	Posterity isn't in front of the front door of their office. It's just in front
2302400	2307480	It's like probably 10 yards away from the building and it's not centered on anything in particular
2307480	2311960	It's just like there do I looking at the building? Do they have any security cameras set up? No
2312880	2318360	Snap some pics and then I'm gonna is this face down or face up face down. I'm gonna roll him over
2318360	2324920	That's him. Is it a can I tell or I'm gonna roll the body when you roll the body over cannot see its face
2324920	2328520	But it does seem to be the body of a woman. Why can I not see its face?
2328520	2332940	Well, okay, you can see her face, but the face is smashed completely
2333500	2335500	Beyond recognition beyond all
2336020	2341380	Recognition this is not a great night for faces. Oh, you know a lot of faces getting messed up in contention
2341380	2345780	Can I can I see if there does she have teeth or finger fingers?
2345780	2351700	It looks like she did probably have teeth at one point but not anymore. Nah, all right
2352220	2358140	Would it would we be able to identify like fingerprints? It's like a black bloody mess and yes, there are fingers
2358220	2363380	Okay, I go and get out my little 10 in case your 10 fingers in case you were wondering nice
2363420	2365580	Look at these fingers, dude. These are great
2366220	2368860	We can well, I don't know how many she started out with
2368860	2373900	I hope she has committed a crime at some point. That way we can identify her in our database
2373900	2379140	I do the I just take a my ink pad and grab a few. Yeah fingerprint fingerprints got him
2379140	2384200	I'm right so other other than her face, which is smashed. Is there any other visible injuries?
2384800	2390120	Smashing mostly it looks like she took smashing damage from the from all over or just the face
2390120	2395540	I would say it looks like from where she hit the ground is where like all of
2398840	2403520	Hit the ground I look at is there anything directly above us when you look up
2403520	2408760	The sky is above you and that seems to be it. Wow, that's amazing. The sky is up there
2408760	2411460	I want to go through the pockets when you go through the pockets
2411460	2418580	There is a small piece of paper that is folded a handful of times and this piece of paper is a thick piece of white
2418580	2424060	Parchment on it is written in this weird black thick ink and it says
2424860	2428300	We is striking when the land gets darkness
2428940	2431340	readying torches hesitate not
2433700	2441380	You're looking at this body and it is wearing what seems to be really thick hand stitched clothing and leather boots and
2441580	2446420	Besides that note in the pocket. That seems to be all you can really garner from it
2446420	2451700	Is there style to the note? Is it written like a poem and does it have funky punctuation?
2451700	2458540	It has punctuation it is we is striking when the land gets darkness period readying torches period hesitate not period
2458540	2462420	Okay, but no it's not in stanza form. Yeah, it's not formatted in a weird way
2462420	2464980	It's just written as it could fit on this piece of paper
2465140	2469960	So that was folded up a couple times and put stuffed into her pocket
2470240	2474680	So you're taking pictures that was the only thing in the pocket. That is the only thing in the pockets
2474680	2481680	How big are the britches fitting nice? I I hike my big old britches up. I'm like man. Those are some nice pants
2481680	2487680	I want to take a strand or two of hair and put it in an evidence bag. Absolutely cutting back to
2488280	2495960	John Lee Pettymore is at the scene and the ambulances arrived. They are going to ask you what happened
2495960	2503200	Well, I was in pursuit of this intoxicated young woman and she fucking smashed her car in that goddamn telephone and ripped her face open
2503240	2509840	I've not seen that's anything like that in a while. Obviously, you know sprint car race and you see your fair share of smashed faces
2509920	2513800	Okay, so they're done like as soon as they get that information. They're like, okay
2513800	2516400	Well, we need to get her to the hospital. And so they start
2518760	2521260	Yeah, the thing about racecar driving
2521260	2529620	So they get out nerves a steal they get her on to a gurney of sorts and it's not a gurney barrel and
2533540	2540940	Bamboo wood and cheesecloth and they get her in the back of this ambulance and falls right through the cheese
2545680	2550120	She gets up and starts running. Yeah, so immediately draw my side
2552180	2554020	Zombie
2554020	2559620	So they take her they take her away and you can probably call Ray and have him take care of the cleanup crew and everything
2559740	2563440	But what do you what do you do? I'm going to go get my car bourbon
2563440	2568500	Oh, yeah, take a swig out of that to steady my nerves and then I'm gonna check her car out
2568500	2571260	I'm gonna do a search probable cause out the ass
2571780	2573660	Yeah, so yeah
2573660	2579460	You're good to check the car when you're going through it in the back seat of the car is a it's a Polaroid
2579780	2586980	Camera and it seems to be from early early Polaroid camera making days. You've never seen a camera like this
2586980	2589900	It's got the normal like chunkiness to it
2589900	2596060	But it's got some like weird glass tubes that go around it and on it is a light
2596580	2601660	that is red and it has a viewfinder and a button to take pictures and
2601900	2607540	Then a spot for the paper to go in and a spot for the paper to come out and then all these glass tubes
2607980	2614940	Probably two or three that like loop around from like one into the other and stuff there any Polaroid sitting around other also
2614940	2619660	Yeah, I forgot to mention there is a Polaroid sitting in the seat of the car
2620100	2626020	In the shotgun seat. It is a Polaroid. It shows the base of a tall building and a group
2626620	2628860	Crowding the entrance with fists raised
2629460	2636940	Everything in the picture is lit by torches in some of the people's hands and the building is a slightly shiny pitch black
2637020	2641500	The entire picture is not fully like colorized
2641500	2648140	It almost seems black and white but the the light from the torches is giving off some sort of like a yellowy
2648220	2654500	Orangish tint would you say maybe perhaps a sepia? Yeah, almost a sepia tone on this picture
2654500	2661540	Does that strike you as odd that strikes John is very odd and he goes and takes another fortify and swig off his bourbon
2661540	2663720	Go ahead and roll a sanity check for me
2664560	2665840	Hard fail, okay
2665840	2671920	So you're gonna lose one sanity and you're gonna need to take that pull instead of just wanting to
2672200	2678360	Off of the old whiskey. So yeah, this is really weird. Like you've never seen anything like this
2678440	2684480	You've probably not messed with Polaroids too much in your life, but you definitely know that if
2685120	2690600	It shouldn't look like this. Yeah, are there any blank? There's paper in the in the camera, okay
2690600	2694780	I want to try to take a picture you click on the button and nothing happens
2695200	2700200	you do notice that on this camera where the red light is coming from there is also a
2700600	2704480	Unlit green light next to it. So the red light is illuminated. Yes. Gotcha
2705060	2707880	Okay, do I see and like an attachment or anything?
2707880	2713040	That's supposed to go into this or a place for that to go somewhere that might activate that green light
2713040	2716560	No, okay does not look like it. Can I just push it push what the green light?
2716560	2718600	It's not a button looks like this is not a button
2718600	2722440	There are two lights side by side one has a red cover
2722600	2726760	Basically one is colored red and the other one is colored green and the red light is shining
2726760	2731460	The green light is not just want to move the camera around and point it at different things and see if that changes
2731520	2737960	What light okay, John Lee Pettymore is standing on the side of the road as a light mist comes down in the darkness
2737960	2743900	He's all alone and he is standing with a camera that is odd in his hands
2744180	2747820	Aiming it at different things and looking at nothing in particular
2749900	2753220	Wow, nothing happened, but it sounded horrifying
2755820	2762180	Yeah, nothing changes, okay as you go through the rest of the car you get to the trunk and in the trunk are
2763500	2765500	multiple gas cans and
2765700	2769360	A bunch of lighters and matches classic firebug. Yes
2769480	2773880	Oh and also inside the car I make a note of that inside the car was a bottle of
2775640	2779420	Brandy bottle of cheap brandy about half gone. Do you take a swig?
2780840	2785640	Not my brand my brand so cutting back to the two of you in the junkyard is special liver
2786240	2789360	Where did we leave you guys? I guess we found that note and
2790600	2796980	I got the fingerprints and a piece of her hair that I'm planning on running. What's the coroner's name here? This is the county
2796980	2801860	Yeah, you can just call the county. Okay, let's give them a call. See if they can figure out
2801860	2806980	I mean, I think I know what killed this person, but let's see what that what their professional opinion is
2806980	2812260	What's your theory their faces smashed them to death? How do you think that happened?
2813420	2818540	That's what that's what I want to find out doesn't sound like you have a theory then or know how this person got killed
2818540	2821740	Oh, I know that they got killed because their faces smashed
2821740	2827100	That's that's what I got cause of death being a face smash cause of death smashed face
2827100	2832820	Yeah, I mean that'll do it for sure. Yeah, I certainly wouldn't want my face smash like this
2832820	2836380	Yeah, I'm done with that. They call it call the corner in I'm gonna do a little search around like it
2836780	2842340	And maybe like a 50-foot radius around this body and see if I can find anything of interest. Okay, cool
2842340	2848260	I want to go into the office. That's right there. Okay, sounds good. First off you give me a
2848900	2850900	search role I
2851060	2858020	Do not pass you do not find anything and Joe Clark Bishop is walking up to the
2859260	2866180	Building the front door of this building and it is unlocked. I go in it is a small room
2866260	2867620	There's only one room
2867620	2874360	There's a desk that is like literally covered in papers and garbage and a bunch of shit just everywhere
2874620	2878740	There's a couple chairs in there that are also covered with shit and there's a bunch of filing cabinets
2878900	2883420	This place is deeply disorganized and no one has been in here in a while
2884060	2886060	I'm just looking to are there any
2886380	2892620	Surveillance anythings any TVs that look like they were at least once surveillance. There is one camera
2892620	2896860	It is in the corner of the room. Can I follow its cord to see where it goes?
2896860	2901800	Yeah, and you would also see that it does point at the front door, which looks out the window
2902600	2906520	Cool, but I mean I want to see where it's Oh where it's hooked up. Yeah. Yeah
2906520	2913540	So I underneath the desk is like the CCTV I turn on the TV. Mm-hmm. Do I get a picture?
2913720	2920440	Yes, is there a VCR anywhere nearby? Oh, yeah, it is connected. It's one of those TV VCR combos
2922160	2924840	So this is Joe doesn't know this would a
2925280	2929040	Police officer to look at the tape in that VCR. Would he take it back to the shop?
2929040	2932980	You can do whatever you want. I guess I'll do I'll just leave it there. Whatever you like
2933300	2940040	I'll look at it there. Okay, I rewind go ahead and roll luck to see if it was recording
2946700	2951220	Baby it was not recording. Yeah, that would have really helped
2952060	2957660	I pop in from my search and I say hey have you found where that camera leads to?
2957660	2959940	Maybe I can do a roll and see if it was
2963580	2965840	Talks about life in a really weird way
2969820	2972140	No, that's how that's how life works cool
2972220	2977100	So you guys at this point could you could have ray come out and watch this scene for the night?

3150780	3155900	Jazz, I wanted to express to Ray that we do want the coroner to like autopsy won't be one
3156900	3164380	Of course yeah, and so I you'll get that report back in the morning and the three of you meet back up at the police department
3164500	3167900	You're probably all out in the parking lot now is about when you would either
3167900	3168840	I don't know

3202700	3205500	here absolutely and then Clark goes to his desk and
3205660	3211940	He starts doing whatever he can in the office with the fingerprints and so you can basically send that stuff in
3211940	3213740	okay to County and
3213740	3218300	Get results back later. I'm doing that Clark you you like to take those crime scene photos and things
3218300	3220580	Mm-hmm. Can you have you ever seen a camera this queer?
3220580	3226580	I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before it looks kind of old with the glass tubing like that
3226580	3231260	I know they used to use that some of them old radio. Yeah, but this this ain't a radio Clark. Yeah
3232700	3236740	This is a weird one this picture mean anything to you I look at the picture you look at the picture
3236740	3242260	I want to look at the picture. The picture is a Polaroid of a base of a tall building
3242620	3246300	There's a group of people crowding the entrance their fists are raised
3246500	3253940	Everything in the picture is lit by torches in some of the people's hands and the building is a slightly shiny pitch black
3254420	3259860	But the only coloring that you see is from the torches and it's like an orange ish yellowish hue
3259860	3261860	Everything else is black and white roll sanity
3263660	3269540	Pass I pass. Okay, you both don't see anything out of the ordinary with from this picture
3269540	3271860	Do I recognize the building by any chance a place?
3271860	3277140	All right, where'd you get this picture and honestly you wouldn't be able to recognize the pic the base of the building
3277140	3279140	anyways, because it's literally just like
3280700	3286420	Like an out an exterior wall, what was the driver's name? I assume we looked at her wallet and stuff
3286420	3290580	Yeah, yeah for sure. Her name is Julie Maxwell. She lives in town. I got this
3290580	3293980	I got this from Julie Maxwell's car. Wait, does that the car you pulled over?
3293980	3299500	Yeah, Julie was the one that called in about the body. Yeah, she's not gonna be doing many calls with that face anymore
3299500	3302540	Is she do we know her? Is she at the hospital right now?
3302540	3307280	She is she stable or she are we gonna be able to talk to her? You don't know I can call up there
3307420	3313700	Okay. Yeah, let's find out also that note said something about torches. I read the note out loud. That's ominous
3316100	3318740	Well, I chant the note
3319740	3325060	This has got to be connected if Julie called in the body. She's got a picture of her
3325500	3332220	Is she in the picture we found a note mentioning mentoring torches we found a picture of
3332860	3340740	Torches one woman's face was smashed another woman's face was split entwined. What was Julie wearing?
3341420	3345380	Did you see the body her not alive? Have you seen her by a live body?
3346740	3348740	What was her are you asking me?
3349740	3351140	Looking like
3351140	3354460	What was her clothing looking like let me stop to recollect
3355300	3357300	picture a single
3357580	3360340	Middle-aged woman who is stuck in the 80s
3361020	3366580	Now you remember your old friend Stacy and her mom. Mm-hmm. Wait. No Stacy's mom has got it going on
3366780	3369380	Who's the one who still thinks it's 1985?
3372700	3378480	She reminded me a lot of your friend's mom who still thinks it's 1985. Oh, yeah, Carol
3379220	3381220	Yeah, she's got Carol hair
3381580	3386980	Carol hair Carol clothes. All right, cuz our body it looked like homemade stuff. I kind of wondered if they were together
3387100	3389100	It's got to be connected. Sure
3389740	3393540	But maybe our Julie's a suspect here. It's getting pretty late at this point
3393540	3397500	You guys might want to call it for the night and can I can I go ahead and call the hospital though?
3397500	3403300	Just to see for sure. She's unconscious. Okay, she's but still alive. Yeah, like not gonna die. Hey, let me roll
3403300	3405300	Oh god
3405540	3408300	Oh, yeah, no, she's dead Julie Maxwell's
3409100	3412860	She's a cop to severe blood loss. She's dead. She's just rolled a hundred
3413980	3418220	She's dead. Hey, remember when you said let me roll. It would have been tight if you
3420180	3426740	Know Julie Maxwell's dead. There was probably there was probably nothing more to gather from that thread. So yeah, I
3427980	3431540	Think we can call this one case closed drive safely folks
3432460	3435020	I'm gonna go home. All right, take it all
3435820	3437820	Sleeper and think about what I've seen today
3438180	3442940	This was my first dead body and I'm kind of creeped but also a little bit stoked. Oh, yeah
3442940	3446980	Hey, go ahead and roll me a sanity for seeing that dead body. I forgot to have you roll that
3446980	3452620	I got an 87 that should be good right? No, I don't think so. What's your sanity 50?
3452620	3455380	yeah, so you're gonna want to head and lose one and
3456620	3460900	Just a quick note for you guys. We're gonna run this as a sanity
3460900	3466580	We'll run as like a humanity tracker to see how much you care about
3467140	3474060	Humanity everything that you see that makes you doubt the like goodness and humanity will make you lose
3474300	3480360	Sanity also anything that makes you think that maybe humanity isn't all that's here will make you lose sanity
3480580	3487400	So that's how we'll be tracking it. I feel a little less like I give a shit about people. Yeah, I think so
3487400	3492880	Hey Keith, who do you know in town? Like who are your friends? Who's your family? Do you have anyone?
3492880	3498320	I've got well my parents. I grew up go ahead and eat that mic. Go ahead and get up on so
3499640	3501640	Don't eat mine
3501840	3507360	Yeah, I grew up here, but my parents both passed away. I don't really have
3508360	3514800	Any like close family? I've only been here a couple months. So I haven't really made friends
3514800	3519040	I don't hang out with people really the only time I see other people is when I'm at work
3519040	3522800	What's your dog's name? My dog's name is bean. I
3523440	3530120	Didn't know if you knew this or not. But uh, it looks like I'm a I'm a distant relative of of those bean boys
3531080	3536940	What what the bean boys the bean boys bean pond stuff you you have?
3537360	3542040	Ancestral roots to the the one of the founders of this town, correct Amundo
3542760	3545160	Cornelius beans Cornelius beans was my
3545800	3551660	Ancestor grades grandpa is in your blood line. He's in my blood line between two and four grades
3552760	3558780	Depending on how quickly they fucked more kids out. I named my dog beans. You poop kids out you fuck them in
3558780	3562520	Oh, that's right. My bad. So your dog's name is beans
3562520	3566960	What kind of dog is it golden retriever and on a scale of how much you love it? It's a lot probably
3566960	3570000	It's probably like a 10. So when you get home that night
3572200	3576600	Being great to at the door. Oh, hell yeah. That's sheen bean. Hey bean
3579280	3581680	And that is the most genuine role-playing

3610760	3617840	he comes home and he cooks his TV dinner in the microwave and he sits down with his TV tray and watches Wheel of Fortune and
3617920	3619300	he
3619300	3624920	Sometimes gets the puzzle before I was gonna say does he play along or does he just watch it for fun every now?
3624920	3628180	And then he gets a puzzle right before anybody else does nice
3629440	3633560	I was kind of thinking this guy's a real lonely sad guy for sure. No, that absolutely makes sense
3634200	3639540	We can he maybe maybe he has a connection with a checkout counter exactly
3639540	3641640	Yeah, a guy at the checkout at the grocery store
3641640	3648000	I love it just kind of they exchange pleasantries does he knows we know each other's names and we kind of know each other's hobbies

3656280	3659600	John Lee Pettymore John stays back a little bit and he
3660360	3663560	Can't really shake this picture. Yeah, he's just kind of looking at it
3664000	3668200	And he probably stays in the station maybe half an hour 40 minutes after everybody leaves
3668200	3671760	Just trying to get his thoughts together. Mm-hmm. And then he goes he leaves
3672360	3677880	He leaves home and he hits up a local bar. Okay, Lee not leaves home leaves the station. Yeah in uniform
3677880	3683080	No, okay sit in my cities. Okay, he's wearing he's wearing tight wranglers a
3683600	3688840	Tucked in pearl snap. Yeah, and a pretty fucking sick leather jacket
3689400	3693560	TBH very cool. I'm not gonna say TBH again. I'll get listeners
3695360	3698400	So you go to clinkers the local bar
3698640	3703680	It's a small bar and all the windows on the outside are blacked out
3703680	3711160	But there are neon lights on the outside with different bush light Miller light Coors light signs neon signage
3711680	3714920	And on the inside it is a smoky small room
3715440	3721560	With three tables and a pool table and a bar Harry is behind the bar as per usual
3722360	3724680	Harry clinker owner of clinkers and

3742640	3745400	One a city council members dog is missing
3746040	3751600	to there's a house on the south side of the old neighborhood where the doors swinging open and mail is piling up and
3751880	3756080	Three there is an oil spill out southeast of town on a country road last night
3756080	3759600	So it's three different calls that came in. Can you can you expand on that oil spill?
3760360	3764040	Yeah, let's see who called that in. Let me check my notes real quick
3765040	3770000	Jimmy Sanders called it in and you would know that Jimmy Sanders is an old buddy of yours
3770000	3772000	maybe even a relative not sure and
3772480	3778880	He is like kind of an old hippie and he is the manager of Subtropolis the sub shop downtown
3779080	3784280	Yeah, no Jimmy. Jimmy Sanders called that in at like 4 in the morning last night
3784280	3788920	And yeah, he said there was an oil spill out out there in the country red. Where's that house at?
3788920	3790920	What house the house?
3791840	3796520	It's on the south side of the old neighborhood which is in the southwest part of town
3796600	3801920	I'm gonna go check out that house anybody want to come with me or should we just all get this all taken care of separately?
3801920	3804880	Also, I think there were a few things you wanted to check when you when you
3805240	3809440	So you've got those three things that came in and then you know that Julie
3810040	3815180	Maxwell is gone. She's no longer with us has a chief come in today. I know she hasn't come in
3815180	3820520	I tried to call her a couple times. It went straight to voicemail. I think you really got her probably hit her home
3820520	3825380	Do you do you guys like that? I'm gonna be a constant character in this game and I sound like this
3826600	3828600	Well, you're better than right
3829360	3831680	What were you wanting to find out today?
3831680	3837840	I forgot if we got any hits on the fingerprints of the hair autopsy or anything or the autopsy. Yeah, okay
3837840	3843840	So we'll do this in order. Nothing came back on the fingerprints. This one is in no zero databases the hair
3844400	3846400	Also, nothing came back
3846400	3851320	DNA wise not in any databases the autopsy report came in and
3852040	3856720	She's dead. She is dead. She died from blunt trauma
3857800	3859800	Hell yeah, dude
3859840	3861840	Which is one way? Oh my god
3865140	3870080	Which is I was gonna say another way to say face smashing do you guys wanna smoke me?
3871040	3874240	Yes, it was blunt trauma and hell yeah, dude
3876400	3880240	Blunt trauma would actually be a pretty fucking great like stoner metal or
3880920	3886680	On the autopsy report. Yeah, she died from blunt trauma. Hell, yeah, but also
3887600	3891480	She had a brand on her back that her skin was
3891800	3895680	Branded and it said this is a fool in all capital letters
3898080	3900880	Clark Clark on the phone is like yikes
3901840	3907880	And they can see where some pictures if you want yeah, dude, was it a fresh brand it was a
3908760	3911500	relatively fresh brand like adidas

3957080	3963040	So I'm gonna go to the it would it would be best if we sent someone's pretty senior to the councilwoman
3963040	3967600	The only thing I was gonna say is that I think Clark would feel like a missing dog is way beneath him
3967600	3973840	I well that depends like in this town. Do we get a call from like a council member and like yeah, that's true
