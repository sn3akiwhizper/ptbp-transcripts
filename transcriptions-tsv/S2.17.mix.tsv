0	3160	Cock-a-doodle-doo, my chickadees.
3160	6480	It's your mother hen, T.J. Wolf the dog here,
6480	11240	to sit on you and increase your body temperatures
11240	14240	with the warm embrace of my bum.
14240	17520	I am giving you life energizing force
17520	22400	live from 694.2 PTBP.
22400	25280	The only radio station that broadcasts
25280	28400	to all chickens across the dimensions.
28400	30880	All of them hear this.
30880	34160	They all know what you all think about them now.
34160	36880	Be wary and beware.
36880	38920	Hey, lean in close.
38920	42000	Let's shake it up because I've been shook.
42000	45980	This is me beside myself and I'm howling with Wolf
45980	50400	at two you slashes who have nailed me to a wall
50400	53140	with a handful of dimes in my mouth.
53140	57320	A detailed description by user,
57320	62200	resistor0 underscore zero was titled,
62200	66440	My View of the Wolf and reads as follows.
66440	69400	Wolf the dog always pops up in my mind
69400	73000	as a crusty Chester Cheeto version wolf
73000	76380	covered in a restaurant trash bag grease.
76380	77600	That is all.
77600	80280	Damn, that's fucking cold.
80280	83860	I'm not some Chester Cheeto looking ass.
83860	86280	I can maybe assure you of that.
86320	88960	Chester Cheeto wishes he could get close
88960	93520	to my beauty, my grace, my grease.
93520	98520	And a sopping wet illustration of supposedly yours truly
99100	103080	was provided by user, BlueBlairyBlob.
103080	105840	Is this what I truly look like?
105840	108720	Has anyone ever actually seen me?
108720	112920	Can the human vision orb even perceive me?
112920	115840	What do y'all think I even look like?
116280	117920	Draw them and show them to me
117920	119700	and show them to the internet.
119700	123860	I heard you people love this worldwide web net.
123860	126560	Sounds a little spooky to me.
126560	129680	If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl,
129680	132400	tag at pretending pod on the internet
132400	136080	and reveal your true self to your internet friends.
136080	139040	Or I guess do something rad on Reddit.
139040	141460	I'm not sure I'm allowed to ask this of you,
141460	145680	but it'd be oily as all get out to see recommendations
146400	151400	for wolf the dog in 694.2 crew on big old internet places
151800	156280	like broad RPG subreddits and niche Facebook groups
156280	158820	and freaky deaky discords.
158820	163000	Word of mouth is the word of the mouth.
163000	166720	Spread the word like Uzi Fogg and cover folks
166720	168200	and wolf the dog.
168200	170680	It feels good when you know you've locked
170680	173960	onto a really good new catchphrase.
173960	176840	I'd say that calls for the news.
176840	179960	Last time, the church doors creaked open
179960	182820	and a group of uniform school children
182820	186900	took on the steep incline to reach the top of the gorge
186900	190880	on the same side where Stevie and the rest of the can crew
190880	194400	were checking on the sopping wet fox godel.
194400	198040	When the party of prep schoolers got close enough,
198040	201760	Beck zoomed in and saw blood on their uniforms.
201760	204780	And also one kid walked on all fours
204780	208280	and one was a kangaroo that walked like a dude.
208280	210840	And the last weird one was a humanoid
210840	212400	with the face of a pug.
212400	216060	And that pug face student had a Jaguar on a leash
216060	219280	that eventually jumped toward a bright spotlight
219280	224080	onto the unnaturally smooth cliff face and to its death.
224080	227800	And the city action news field team shot a stunning
227800	230880	little clip with a horrifying background.
230880	234160	The gang in the school uniform stood there
234160	236920	unmoving across the rift.
236920	238560	Enough with the rift.
238560	240260	Let's hear a riff.
240260	243220	It's Alter Girl with My Life Is Great
243220	245520	and It's All My Fault.
245520	247520	And it's all my fault.
275520	280520	Luke just said he'd say it to your faces.
282400	286400	If you live in Australia, suck it.
286400	289120	Oh my God, that's not the message.
289120	290960	I know that is the, that's the message.
290960	292960	If you live on Australia, you can probably get it.
292960	294120	On Australia?
294120	298160	If you live on Australia, you drink Fosters
298160	303060	out of a ditry dude shaped like a boomerang, bitch.
303060	303900	Oh my God.
305380	306860	Anyway, buckle the fuck up.
306860	308460	We're about to kill a kangaroo.
312020	314220	Specifically because it's Australian.
315700	317000	Dog your Barbies.
317820	319260	Dog your Barbies.
319260	320820	Dog your Barbies, bitches.
320820	323500	You better dog your Barbies.
323500	325340	Cause these boys from the Ozarks
325340	327220	are coming from you, Australia.
329140	329980	Coming.
329980	330820	Coming from you.
330820	331640	Coming from you.
331640	332480	Coming from you.
333260	334300	We're coming from you.
334300	335540	We get where you're coming from,
335540	337540	but we're going to kill your kangaroo.
338900	340980	You guys already left.
340980	341820	We're coming back.
341820	342660	We're coming back.
342660	343480	We're coming back.
343480	344320	Just kill him.
345260	349100	I got one job on this earth left.
353380	354220	Is that from something?
354220	357180	And I got one thing to do right.
357180	359860	One thing before I can pass easy.
360860	363360	And that's make sure that pink group pass hard.
366760	369800	Julius always like, anytime he went to the zoo,
369800	371420	he would see the kangaroos and be like,
371420	372260	I can do that.
372260	373100	I'm totally better than that.
373100	374260	I can do that.
377820	380260	Julius is like, shit animal.
380260	383060	He would look down at his thighs and be like, so what?
384420	385700	What about your pouch?
386580	389500	That pissed him off.
389500	390940	Cause he didn't have one.
390940	391780	Damn.
391780	393140	So he starts wearing a fanny pack
393140	395420	and is immensely popular at a young age.
395420	397680	Pretending to marsupial.
397680	398980	Let's go.
398980	401140	Let's get 30 seconds of silence actually.
401140	402300	Let's kill this energy.
402300	403140	Agreed.
403140	406260	I was going to say kangaroo jack, crocodile Dundee,
406260	407260	a cry in the dark.
407260	409300	There was a crocodile person over there too.
409300	410120	That's my bad.
410120	411460	Wearing a school uniform.
411460	413780	No, I was just saying Australian movies.
413780	415160	Oh, yeah.
415160	416460	Are there any others?
416460	417540	Are there any?
417540	418380	The Sapphires?
418380	419220	No.
419780	420620	The proposition.
420620	422260	Ah, the proposal.
422260	424780	What's the big epic with Nicole Kidman?
424780	425740	Mad Max.
427340	429300	I mean, yeah, every Mad Max is an Australian movie.
429300	433300	I would watch a Nicole Kidman Mad Max reboot.
433300	435540	She's got, you know, just like bring me
435540	437100	to the theater energy these days.
437100	438740	I don't know what it is.
438740	440060	What was that movie, Joe?
440060	441500	The sheep fucker's daughter.
443540	444780	I think that was it.
444780	449180	Welcome to episode 17 of Pretending to Be Keep.
449180	452700	It looks like we're trending a number one improv podcast
452700	453540	in Australia now.
454660	456000	We were a number two.
457860	459100	Oh, is that Luxembourg?
461100	462420	Shout out to Luxembourg.
462420	463620	Shout out.
463620	465440	Luxembourgish fans, we have your back
465440	467420	unlike those fucking Australians.
468580	470620	No, I'm like, I want to go to Australia.
470620	471460	It seems so cool.
471460	473380	Oh fuck, the movie was called Australia.
480180	481020	Oh no.
498420	499980	Either no one's going to listen from now on
499980	501420	or they're going to want this every time.
501420	503660	It's going to be hard to do.
503660	506060	Listen next week to see if we pick your country.
506980	508460	Listen two weeks from now.
509420	510780	Oops.
510780	513100	Or give us money and it will be next week.
514460	517060	So everything's fine seemingly.
517060	518620	Yeah, everything's fine.
518620	522300	Well, we just wrapped our day of shooting.
522300	524740	We got that last little stinger there.
524740	525620	It's in the can.
525620	528620	And now we're in the can van.
528620	531700	Julius was showing Cal how to use TikTok.
531700	532540	What time is it?
532540	535020	I imagine cinematically it was like the sun was setting
535100	536060	as all that happened, right?
536060	537300	Hondo, pee.
537300	540620	Yeah, over those angry animal kids, people.
540620	542900	Are they like, are they grownups?
542900	544940	Oh, we're in like.
544940	546540	The kids are the animals.
546540	548200	There's six normal kids and then.
548200	551780	I think there is six kids standing up straight.
551780	556460	One extra bloody kid standing up straight who had a name.
556460	559680	One who still has a name technically.
559680	561100	We just, we didn't find it out though.
561100	564620	Exactly, you know, I'm just describing it as people, right?
565140	565980	I forgot to ask them their names.
565980	567300	Yeah, you gotta yell out.
567300	569140	Hey, Stevie, do you know any of those kids' names?
569140	569980	No.
569980	574980	And you guys saw that there was also the human
575620	578260	with the pug head.
578260	579980	That's the one I liked the least.
579980	581540	That's the one that we killed the pet of.
581540	582540	That is correct.
582540	584020	And then there was a kangaroo.
584020	587620	So you're not sure of the ages from either of them.
587620	590460	Yeah, the kid who was on the ground is a kid crawling.
590460	593100	Yeah, the kid on his knuckles dragging, that's a kid.
593140	595540	You've got the pug man.
595540	598660	That is a much taller creature, humanoid,
598660	599780	than the children.
599780	601500	And then kangaroo is kangaroo.
601500	602320	Fully kangaroo?
602320	603160	I would say.
603160	604420	Oh no, you said walking kind of human-like.
604420	609420	Walking almost up on its toes to walk more human-like.
609620	611900	I can't wait until Slide Whistle draws the pug man.
611900	612740	Oh.
614560	615500	Please?
615500	616820	Please.
616820	620860	And we're reviewing, we're seeing this on video
620860	622700	as we're driving back to the.
622700	625620	That's right, and you're driving on these roads.
625620	627820	So we got everything out of the lockers without a hitch.
627820	629260	I was a little worried that there would be something
629260	630100	in the lockers. I'm not gonna do that
630100	631100	to you, huh? Okay.
631100	632880	Everything that you brought, you grabbed.
632880	633980	You had enough time there.
633980	636820	You took the time to shoot a little segment, you know,
636820	638520	and nothing bad happened.
638520	640940	It was intimidating how they just stood there silently
640940	643880	for like 15 minutes while we shot our segment
643880	645380	and then packed up leisurely.
645380	646620	It felt very ominous.
646620	650700	We do need to make sure that Fox doesn't die.
650700	652340	Oh, I don't wanna touch that wet freak.
652340	656300	Do you guys have any zip ties or something like that?
656300	657300	We could do his hands.
657300	658980	Julius already got his shoes.
658980	661580	And you look down and see that his shoes are tied.
661580	662400	Together? Together.
662400	663820	Not just individually, nicely.
663820	667980	Way to tie, that was very kind of you, to tie God's shoes.
667980	670140	Together, in a tripping formation.
670140	672740	We definitely have zip ties in the can van.
672740	673820	Yeah. Like that supplies.
673820	676540	And you would like duct tape and everything.
676540	678980	Yeah, you guys are awful people.
678980	679820	Yeah, of course.
679820	681020	No. No, oh, right.
681020	681980	We're a film crew.
682500	683700	We have useful things.
683700	688100	And she throws on the zip ties behind the back of Fox Coddle
688100	690120	and he is still unconscious.
690120	691780	And she's like, I guess we should try
691780	695060	to make him comfortable that way he stays this way
695060	696180	as long as possible.
696180	697260	Stevie, I don't wanna get lost
697260	698900	in the weeds here theologically.
698900	700280	You know, have you ever heard about like,
700280	702560	could God microwave a burrito so hot
702560	703820	he himself could not eat it?
703820	704900	Oh, whoa.
704900	707660	If this is really God, can he just break some zip ties?
707660	710140	Is he constrained by the limits of his physical form?
710180	713540	Well, I have to assume he was a turtle for a reason.
713540	715940	How do we get him back into something like a turtle?
715940	719100	I think we gotta like kill him when he's around a turtle.
719100	720100	That's the mayor.
720100	721900	Oh yeah, we gotta like decree the turtle,
721900	723440	the new mayor, then kill him.
723440	724860	Do we have to kill him?
724860	727500	Maybe not, maybe just decreeing a new mayor
727500	729820	makes it like automatically transfer.
729820	730660	Let's try.
731660	733780	Okay, who am I gonna make the new mayor?
733780	736540	Let's think about this maybe a lot more.
736540	738740	Beck wants to be filming out the back window,
738780	740380	keeping an eye and make sure we're not being followed
740380	741220	out of the gates of the wall.
741220	743500	Oh, you just keep seeing these signs
743500	747100	that are like dead end, road stops here,
747100	749500	no outlet, please stop.
749500	752060	There's like some danger signs.
752060	754560	And you're on this road all by yourselves
754560	758740	and there's no streets that are like coming off
758740	760740	of these streets, do you know what I mean?
760740	761660	Do you know what I mean?
761660	764900	Julius wants to, not all of them at the same time
764900	766000	because the algorithm,
766000	768620	but upload at least one crazy TikTok.
769460	773460	Let's find out which TikTok.
773460	775140	You took a few while we were there.
775140	778000	Should we actually pause and like figure out what they were?
778000	779900	Okay, there was the at the very end,
779900	782940	the year dance before we got attacked by the Jaguar.
782940	783760	Sure.
783760	785740	When we were getting onto the train.
785740	786580	That's right.
786580	789340	Technically that includes the Jaguar attack.
789340	791060	He hits the window as you were filming,
791060	792540	so it's got all that.
792540	794500	Right, but then there's one of us.
794500	795340	That's what I was talking about.
795340	797680	Yeah, we got on the train before we got back off
797680	800040	to rescue Chuck.
800040	802440	So there's that one and I think that one includes us
802440	804320	doing funny walks, sneaking.
804320	807760	Yes, there is the good sneaking one across the plant wall.
807760	810800	And I assume it also has you pointing it right in my face
810800	812840	as I say turn that off and get on the fucking train.
812840	814280	That's in that one.
814280	816560	There's also the one where you're in the it pitch.
816560	819240	Yeah, with all the crazy symbols and stuff.
819240	820080	Yep, behind.
820080	821480	Previous to that.
821480	823280	I'm sure I got the Jack.
823280	825800	Did I get the Jackalope attack?
825920	827080	Yes, exactly.
829320	830480	That is the headline here.
830480	831880	Jackalope attack.
831880	833600	It totally got me, dude.
833600	835880	It snuck up on me with malicious intent.
835880	837040	It wasn't my fault.
837040	839480	Sometimes spin is morally justified.
839480	840320	Whoa.
841840	842680	That's heavy.
844440	845840	He's gonna do the Jackalope attack.
845840	846720	Whichever one you think.
846720	848720	You know more about this kid stuff than me.
848720	850560	Beck, is it okay if I show this?
850560	852300	I think that's like probably the best one
852300	853800	because in the end of it,
854000	856280	it's just a rabbit with horns tied onto it.
856280	858320	It gives a taste of the thing that is crazy,
858320	859680	but it's not the craziest.
859680	862080	Or do we show something crazier and tease it?
862080	865280	I'm sure that one was showing Grover's Gorge
865280	867080	and then, oh no, Jackalope attack.
867080	867920	Oh no, oh no.
867920	871280	Once we make the choice, we should have to roll to see.
871280	875760	That's the song that plays when he zooms in on my leg wounds.
875760	877440	Oh, perfect.
877440	879600	So now we need to do an algorithm roll
879600	882720	to see how well it favors us.
882760	883600	How well it favors us.
883600	884920	Is that audio being used?
884920	886360	Do you think this is a straight up luck roll?
886360	887440	Oh yeah, defo.
893080	896880	Luke had a giant landing pad of a dice rolling tray
896880	898360	and missed the tray.
898360	899640	Threw it behind his head.
899640	901520	It fell out of my hand as I shook it.
901520	904920	He threw it behind his head.
904920	906720	Well, it's a 92.
906720	908080	You know what that means.
908080	908960	Spend some luck.
908960	909780	Do you have luck?
909780	910880	So we can go viral?
910880	912920	Yeah, I'll spend luck so we can go viral.
914440	918800	What is your, no, what's your notification sound bite?
918800	920240	And also give me your luck coin.
920240	921320	There's my luck coin.
921320	922160	Flick it.
923600	924440	Nice.
924440	925280	So good.
925280	926920	What's the notification on the phone?
926920	928040	Yeah, what's the noise?
928040	930320	Obama saying, yes, we can.
930320	931680	What noise do you mean though?
931680	934400	Like that he received the notification noise?
934400	936480	I assume he means it's about to start blasting off.
936480	939600	Yeah, I was just gonna do a bunch of them over and over.
939600	942760	So I guess I'll drop that in here.
942760	943600	Yes, we can.
943600	945300	Si, se puede.
945300	946140	Yes, we can.
947580	948420	Yes, we can.
948420	949660	Yes, we can.
949660	950500	Yes, we can.
950500	951320	Yes, we can.
951320	952160	Yes, we can.
952160	953000	Yes, we can.
953000	954000	Thank you, Mr. President.
954000	955480	And we're back.
956760	958040	Your phone is just lighting up.
958040	959840	And so is Julius's face.
960780	961620	Cal.
961620	962800	Which he's picking at furiously.
962800	964400	When Cal hears Obama's voice,
964400	966100	he like legitimately gets a tear.
968280	969440	I miss that man.
970320	971960	And we're driving.
971960	975760	Hey, Stevie, like now we've seen this like transfer of God
975760	977280	or whatever twice.
977280	978100	And both times it was a thing.
978100	980880	Their eyes just get fucking huge when you say that.
980880	983600	Both times it was a thing leaping off of a thing.
983600	985040	Is that like part of it?
985040	986740	Without looking away,
986740	990120	you're looking in the rear view mirror at Stevie's face,
990120	992400	which is pointed directly at the road.
992400	996000	No flinching, no moving, just yeah, I,
997000	1000760	They used to say that's how it would change bodies.
1000760	1003200	The original mayor, they were so scared
1003200	1006560	that he was gonna come back like he was
1006560	1010080	that they put a cage around his coffin.
1010080	1010920	Crumpy?
1010920	1012840	That's right, Jeremiah Crumpy.
1012840	1015400	And the story goes would,
1015400	1017280	and they kind of take their hand
1017280	1019480	and do the like under the chin,
1019480	1021160	throw the hand back and forth thing.
1021160	1022760	Throw their hand back and forth.
1022760	1024400	Throw their hand back and forth.
1024400	1025960	Throw their hand back and forth.
1026960	1029080	But it's like just that they kill themselves.
1029080	1031520	It's not necessarily that they leap off of something.
1031520	1033800	Yeah, a leap of faith as it were.
1033800	1036960	I have a theory on that, but I don't want to bring it up.
1036960	1038200	Here's the deal, like do we need to keep,
1038200	1040400	Hey Zach, do you call it the leap of faith in your notes?
1040400	1042440	Did I nail that?
1042440	1045080	I'm just wondering if we need to keep Fox away from ledges.
1045080	1046080	It's a little smile.
1047080	1048600	I mean, I think it's a good idea
1048600	1050240	to keep Fox away from ledges.
1050240	1052760	Or do we have to keep them away from like fucking everything?
1052760	1055640	I think that's the probably one that we should go with.
1056160	1057000	Like we're going to have to like,
1057000	1058560	what'd you say keep them in a cage?
1058560	1059400	Well.
1059400	1062400	I've got a basement in my townhouse.
1062400	1063840	You can't jump off of that.
1063840	1067600	Do the mayors have any like any idea what's going on
1067600	1069480	or are they basically zombies?
1069480	1073640	Well, the only one that I knew was Sandro and,
1073640	1075040	Rest in peace little guy.
1075040	1078120	Until Chuck and the only thing we,
1078120	1079680	what did you get out of Chuck?
1079680	1081520	It seemed like he was pretty much driven
1081520	1083280	to throw himself off that gorge.
1083280	1087080	I met Jeremiah Krumpy, but long after he was deceased.
1087080	1089800	What do you, what are you talking about Julius?
1089800	1091720	What is this Krumpy stuff?
1091720	1093760	What is this Krumpy stuff?
1093760	1096160	He's buried behind Fox's house
1096160	1097920	and I tripped over his grave.
1097920	1099360	He was the original mayor.
1099360	1100200	Yeah.
1100200	1101120	They caged his grave site.
1101120	1102240	Yeah, I thought it was a bit odd,
1102240	1105040	but I thought maybe it was to keep kids off of it.
1105040	1107480	They used to do it for witches and vampires,
1107480	1108720	you know, in the fifties.
1108720	1113360	So, I mean, we got to keep him locked up.
1113360	1116280	Yeah, that's my biggest fear is that when he gets conscious,
1116280	1118280	he's just going to start like grabbing scissors
1118280	1119520	and poking them in his eye.
1119520	1123000	Yeah, that's, and she points at the zip ties.
1123000	1126360	Man, when we get back in Cal, Colorado's on Bumble
1126360	1127720	and trying to have a dinner date,
1127720	1130320	while God is in his basement trying to kill himself.
1132200	1133720	That's going to be great.
1133720	1135320	I think we're on to something.
1139480	1141520	Tell me about that basement.
1141520	1144680	Oh no, it's not finished.
1144680	1145520	Even better.
1145520	1148480	Yeah, I guess like no one will go down there.
1148480	1150680	Oh, I thought you were, we were on the date.
1154520	1158360	No, no, God will be quite comfortable in the basement,
1158360	1159200	I think.
1159200	1160680	We're calling him God, this is God.
1160680	1161520	We're saying this is God.
1161520	1163120	No, it's just, it's Greg.
1163120	1163960	Greg.
1163960	1165080	I mean, that's just Greg.
1165080	1165920	Greg.
1165920	1166760	Gregle.
1166760	1167600	Gregertle.
1167600	1168440	Don't make it weird.
1168440	1169720	I mean, it can just be Greg
1169720	1172640	and hopefully we can get this thing, whatever it is out.
1172640	1173720	Sorry, sorry.
1173720	1175640	Wait, was Greg Fox's name?
1175640	1178520	Yeah, before he got God.
1178520	1180120	Once this footage is released,
1180120	1183400	I bet some authority would want to take him.
1183400	1186680	I'm all screwed up about like what's right and wrong here
1186680	1187520	at this point.
1187520	1192200	But if it is God, do you think we have like an obligation
1192200	1195240	to like keep that to ourselves
1195240	1198120	and like make sure that he doesn't do bad things or?
1198120	1201960	I understood it as not actual God,
1201960	1203800	but he did go to church.
1206520	1209640	Whatever it is, it seems to be a very dangerous
1209640	1210760	and powerful thing.
1210760	1212440	And I think you're right, Beck.
1212440	1214160	I don't know who we can trust with this shit.
1214160	1215920	I think we leave him out of the edit,
1215920	1217000	if you know what I mean.
1217000	1219760	And maybe don't mention he came back to town.
1219760	1220600	Yeah.
1220600	1223480	I guess like our first like thing would be to try
1223520	1227160	just like declaring like you have a pet goldfish
1227160	1229720	that we can say is the new mayor and just see if that works.
1229720	1231720	No, Goldie died several weeks ago.
1231720	1232560	Oh, Cal.
1232560	1236200	Maybe something that lives a lot longer than a goldfish,
1236200	1237280	like a rock.
1237280	1238880	I do have a pet rock somewhere.
1238880	1241400	Dude, can we make a rock God?
1241400	1245040	Could you make a rock so God that even God couldn't rock it?
1245040	1247520	I'll show you a rock God.
1248800	1249640	Whom?
1249640	1250460	Bon Jovi.
1250460	1251920	Thank you.
1251920	1252760	What'd you say?
1252880	1253760	We met our editor, Cole.
1253760	1254840	Oh, nice.
1256320	1258480	Here's what I propose.
1258480	1262040	We cut the story and get the word out to the world
1262040	1263560	about what they're doing there.
1263560	1266740	I don't think we should tell anyone we have Greg.
1266740	1267580	Agreed.
1267580	1268920	But everything else?
1268920	1270160	Everything else.
1270160	1271120	Everything else.
1271120	1272520	Everything else.
1272520	1273360	Yeah.
1273360	1274200	Everything else.
1274200	1277500	That's for Greg's safety, the world's safety
1277500	1278360	and our own safety.
1278360	1280400	We don't know who would wanna come for us.
1280400	1282640	Right now, it's those weird fucking kids
1282640	1283680	who know we have them.
1283680	1286840	Dude, when the world sees the footage, though,
1286840	1289860	like, we are going to change the world, yo.
1289860	1292920	This is the biggest story of the last 50 years.
1292920	1294860	I'm sorry, I forgot about 9-11.
1294860	1295700	Heh.
1298480	1299320	Moment of silence.
1299320	1300140	It's obviously not as big as 9-11.
1300140	1301200	Moment of silence.
1301200	1302480	Moment of silence.
1302480	1305900	You don't think this is a bigger deal than 9-11?
1305900	1309400	This could potentially be as big as 9-11.
1309400	1312880	Do you think season two will be as big as 9-11?
1312880	1316760	This podcast is bigger than the Beatles.
1319400	1320520	Moment of silence complete.
1320520	1324280	Okay, so like, yeah, the plan is get Greg, God,
1324280	1326920	Greg God into Cal's basement.
1326920	1327760	Okay.
1327760	1329940	We'll go to the pet store, find a turtle,
1329940	1331600	and we'll just see if that works.
1331600	1334120	And like, if that doesn't work, we're back to square one,
1334120	1335480	but at least we tried something.
1335480	1338240	We obviously do that after we show the news.
1338240	1340620	Oh yeah, and like that, and like change the world
1340620	1342280	in the process, yeah, of course.
1342280	1344840	So we're gonna go, like, take the footage
1344840	1346600	and drop it off first, and then take Greg?
1346600	1348760	As the producer, that's definitely what I say.
1348760	1351080	No, no, no, we need to get Greg in the basement,
1351080	1353220	but then Stevie and I could maybe take care of him
1353220	1355280	and you two can put the cut together.
1355280	1358360	I look over at Julius, are you still at like,
1358360	1361000	two hit points, are you still like, bloody as hell?
1361000	1364920	Yes, and I'm like, picking the skin that's on my face
1364920	1367920	is like, yanking at it and like, kind of stripping it off.
1368520	1371520	We also gotta give Julius to a goddamn hospital.
1372520	1376140	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, Greg, Julius.
1376140	1379200	No, no, the news before me.
1379200	1381480	You didn't happen to pack one of those,
1381480	1384040	you know, magic, God'll heal things, did you?
1384040	1385920	Oh, I didn't even think about it.
1385920	1388440	That would have been so handy, aw.
1388440	1389780	Good thing I grabbed one.
1391220	1392960	We can always count on you, Beck.
1392960	1393800	95.
1397480	1399360	You failed your role, so I do have it,
1399360	1400180	is that what you meant?
1400180	1401020	Yeah.
1401960	1404760	That's the Zach Luck role that he failed.
1404760	1407000	I guess, I mean, I wanna see this cut
1407000	1408640	before I go to the news, but I mean,
1408640	1410280	we could get rid of God first.
1410280	1412200	Julius, can I see your hands for a second?
1412200	1413240	He holds his hands up.
1413240	1415480	I wrapped some gaffer tape around him, so you can't.
1415480	1416320	Whoa!
1417200	1419320	Take your last two hit points away
1419320	1420600	by picking at your face.
1420600	1422360	He's gonna try to fight that
1422600	1423720	just because he doesn't want it to happen,
1423720	1425400	but I think that's a good idea.
1428040	1431520	All right, let's see a little unarmed combat going on here.
1431520	1432360	Uh-oh.
1433720	1435000	I got a crit success.
1435000	1436560	Oh, damn.
1436560	1438840	Well, that's just a crit success to not get.
1438840	1440320	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1440320	1443120	So as you like nimbly blasted away.
1443120	1444320	You kill Calcala.
1446000	1449080	You dodge and he's, I wanna try to persuade you
1449080	1450160	that this is a good idea.
1450160	1451560	I'm like, I understand, I understand,
1451600	1453080	I should have just come at you like that,
1453080	1455200	but I think we might need to get your hands
1455200	1456480	under control here for a second
1456480	1458400	before you poltergeist your own head.
1458400	1459240	Yeah.
1459240	1460920	You can roll if you want, but because you crit,
1460920	1462440	I'm gonna go ahead and say like,
1462440	1464680	you can just like tell him to fuck off if you want.
1464680	1467000	I'll roll my persuade, like it says to,
1468080	1469600	I got a 43 on a 60.
1469600	1471640	I got a 63 on a 70.
1471640	1472480	Ooh!
1472480	1474960	Oh, no, sorry, a 36.
1474960	1475800	Oh.
1475800	1476640	Boom.
1476640	1477480	What'd you roll?
1477480	1478300	A 43.
1478300	1479140	Better than that.
1479140	1479960	So I.
1479960	1480800	Whiplash!
1480880	1482200	Picking at his face.
1482200	1486960	Okay, yeah, so, okay, good talk, Julius.
1486960	1488120	He's picking at his face,
1488120	1491040	but then Julius is like in his notes on his phone,
1491040	1493880	like writing down thoughts on different ways to cut this.
1493880	1494720	The video.
1494720	1496120	The footage, yeah.
1497120	1498120	And his face off.
1500480	1502520	All right, I need you guys to, someone,
1502520	1505100	I need you to elect a rolling leader
1505100	1508960	who has a D8 closest to them.
1508960	1510560	Luke, Luke is gonna roll the D8.
1511160	1515240	To see how many eighths of gas are in this gas tank.
1516840	1518300	More like eighths of something else,
1518300	1519400	you know what I mean?
1519400	1520720	Weed.
1520720	1521560	Eight.
1521560	1522400	Hell yeah.
1522400	1523220	Full tank.
1523220	1524440	They filled it up while we parked.
1526440	1527960	Compliments of Grover's Gulch.
1527960	1529200	Yeah, come back and see us.
1529200	1530560	You're only a few hours away.
1530560	1533240	It's about as full as a tank could possibly be
1533240	1535200	after driving this distance.
1535200	1537280	We stopped at a gas station right before we pulled off.
1537840	1540680	The same gas station is approaching on your right
1540680	1542800	and it is the first building
1542800	1545480	that you really see on this side of civilization.
1545480	1547680	You seem to be coming back onto a road
1547680	1549680	that might be used for more
1549680	1552960	than just heading out to this location.
1552960	1556080	And as you come up to this gas station,
1556080	1560960	you see that there are three black SUVs.
1560960	1562620	No, that's not fun.
1562620	1566160	There are three pink SUVs.
1566160	1567600	Now that's fun.
1569000	1569840	Spaceships.
1569840	1570680	Camels.
1570680	1571500	Kangaroos.
1571500	1572340	Helicopters.
1572340	1574720	There are three green.
1574720	1576220	Roombas.
1576220	1577920	Range Rovers.
1577920	1581520	Like bright green Range Rovers.
1581520	1586520	And they are all parked in a line at three pumps.
1586600	1588360	It's probably nothing to worry about.
1589780	1592400	Simultaneously the doors open
1592400	1597400	and men wearing monochromatic gray scale suits
1599200	1603160	with a green accent being their tie and their,
1603160	1605140	what's the thing that goes in your pocket?
1605140	1606980	Pocket square.
1606980	1609760	And their green pocket square and their green tie
1609760	1612540	get out and begin pumping gas.
1614680	1616160	What's the matter, Stevie?
1616160	1618720	That's jolly green jottles.
1619240	1623440	Golly, dream goggles.
1623440	1624600	Jolly green jottles.
1626180	1627640	Jolly green jottles.
1629220	1631960	I just, that, yeah, that's them.
1631960	1634440	I guess just keep your heads forward and don't.
1634440	1635840	Everybody act casual.
1635840	1637940	Julius, pretend to do a TikTok.
1639940	1643920	Julius is like writing notes on his thoughts on the edit.
1643920	1644760	That looks like a TikTok.
1644760	1646680	He just like does a little dance.
1647680	1650360	As far as Kal knows, you're doing a TikTok.
1652280	1653320	Great job, great job.
1653320	1654360	Great job.
1654360	1655200	Great job.
1655200	1656560	You totally looped that roll.
1660920	1663080	And as you continue to drive,
1663080	1666100	as you're almost past this gas station,
1666100	1670440	you see one of the side doors opens from the back
1670440	1673640	of one of these green Range Rovers and out steps.
1674920	1675920	Fred Godel.
1675920	1676960	He was on his way back.
1676960	1677800	I forgot.
1677800	1678880	Oh, shit.
1678880	1679720	We knew that.
1679720	1684300	And he squints as he looks at the can van
1684300	1687080	driving back toward the city.
1687080	1690220	You guys are back in the can van, heading down the road.
1690220	1691960	You're back in the normal world.
1691960	1694480	So you're seeing homes, you're seeing normal signs.
1694480	1696760	Please stop and interview him.
1696760	1699040	Julius says, looking like,
1700120	1703280	he says it as a statement, but it's really as a question.
1703280	1704440	No, no.
1704440	1707040	No, Julius, we will die if we talk to that man.
1707040	1710680	We've also got his daughter with us right now.
1710680	1712080	And his son.
1712080	1712920	Son.
1712920	1713880	Whoa.
1713880	1716280	Let's not forget, we also have the mayor of his town.
1716280	1717160	Shit.
1717160	1718000	And?
1718000	1719300	Oh, I'm not going back.
1719300	1720140	She's driving.
1720140	1722380	Yeah, she's like, fuck that, Julius.
1722380	1723840	I'm not doing that shit.
1723840	1726640	He knew that was the correct answer, but he had to ask.
1728080	1730480	Do you think he saw you, Stevie?
1730520	1733400	She's just like frozen this whole time
1733400	1735840	in the rear view mirror, just staring.
1735840	1737080	Oh shit, Stevie, jackalope.
1737080	1737920	Ugh.
1739460	1742440	And you see a rabbit with a stick
1742440	1744840	like kind of like stuck to it almost.
1744840	1745680	Like it's.
1745680	1746500	Like some burrs.
1746500	1747340	Yeah, it kind of got caught up.
1747340	1748160	At the end of a twig.
1748160	1749000	Yeah.
1749000	1750240	Stevie, what?
1750240	1751400	She smashes it.
1753080	1755160	Oh, that poor little jackalope.
1755160	1757240	Stevie, what were the circumstances
1757240	1759240	of you leaving Grower's Gorge?
1759240	1762200	Still driving, still working in the rear view mirror.
1762200	1763280	Who's hitting shotgun?
1763280	1764120	Probably Cal.
1764120	1767120	I figured we were all in the back like figuring shit out.
1767120	1767960	Yeah, that's good.
1767960	1770220	Looking at footage and tying up Fox.
1770220	1771200	Beck is getting a shot
1771200	1773240	of whatever Stevie's response is gonna be.
1773240	1775820	Yeah, no, I saw.
1777720	1779400	You know that moment when you find out
1779400	1781640	that maybe your parents aren't good?
1781640	1783400	I don't know if you've ever had that.
1783400	1784240	Yes.
1784240	1785800	So that's a weird feeling.
1785800	1790800	And when I kind of saw what I had tied my life to,
1791480	1795000	what I was born into, I couldn't hang.
1795000	1797280	So I'd been talking to Susan.
1797280	1799760	Susan's the judge.
1799760	1801280	Susan Bloom, Judge Bloom.
1801280	1803240	And then Susan was helping.
1803240	1805480	I mean, we were trying to help, but.
1805480	1806640	Help how?
1806640	1808920	Well, I mean, you saw the it pit.
1808920	1811800	You know, we were trying to save the new visitors.
1811800	1814900	So sometimes people would just kind of appear
1814900	1816440	and it wasn't just people.
1816440	1818460	It was like all sorts of things and creatures
1818460	1819500	like we saw back there.
1819500	1823980	And we were trying to help them because what would I mean?
1823980	1826580	Vernon would take them and put them in the it pit
1826580	1828140	because that's what Fred needed.
1828140	1832100	And we didn't really see them again after that.
1832100	1833780	Because Fred needed them to be quiet
1833780	1836820	or because he needed them to die in the it pit?
1836820	1838540	I think he needed something from them.
1838540	1840580	I don't know exactly what,
1840580	1843620	but we found animal ears down there also.
1843660	1845580	Now that we've seen animal people,
1845580	1847380	it was like transforming them?
1847380	1851460	No, I mean, they were showing up like all sorts of things.
1851460	1853020	Oh, they were starting animal-ly.
1853020	1855620	Yeah, they were just popping into Grover's Gorge.
1855620	1857020	We started getting the visitors
1857020	1858820	and I mean, I got out of there quick.
1858820	1860740	Susan and I tried to do what we could,
1860740	1862780	but it wasn't too long after that.
1862780	1865260	And their eyes just kind of fade away
1865260	1869180	and you see it's something cut deep enough
1869180	1872380	to leave everything they knew behind.
1872380	1874060	And she just can't bring herself.
1874060	1876780	She, despite of all that, let you go to the it pit.
1876780	1878980	She knew that if she said anything,
1878980	1883980	she'd be in their same position.
1884020	1884860	I understand.
1884860	1886460	Stevie, we are not our families.
1886460	1889180	We can move beyond that and become our own people.
1889180	1890020	I did.
1890860	1892420	Or tried.
1892420	1894660	So why'd you go back with us?
1894660	1896140	We got what we needed.
1896140	1897300	Hell yeah, we did.
1897300	1898500	Let's shut them down.
1898500	1901660	That's the spirit of a real can news intern.
1901780	1903540	Let's show the world what they're doing.
1903540	1904380	Let's do it.
1904380	1905220	Yeah.
1905220	1907220	Through the transformative power of journalism.
1907220	1908460	I'm sleepy.
1908460	1910220	And he's like closing his eyes.
1910220	1911060	Yeah.
1915820	1916980	Julius, dude, stay with me, dude.
1916980	1917820	Stay with me, dude.
1917820	1918980	He shakes his head back awake
1918980	1920900	like he's trying to keep his eyes open.
1920900	1923100	Maybe we should drop him at a hospital.
1923100	1923940	No, no.
1923940	1926260	The way they do in the movies where they just
1926260	1927860	throw you in front of the emergency room.
1927860	1929460	Julius, I hate to tell you this.
1929460	1932060	I think Stevie's gonna have to help Beck with the cut.
1932060	1933740	You're still my super producer.
1935980	1938860	He half forcing himself to stay awake
1938860	1941820	is continuing to write his thoughts down in his notes.
1941820	1943220	The camera peeps over your shoulder
1943220	1946380	and it's just like the same letter over and over again.
1946380	1948060	It's Z, yeah.
1948060	1950380	Text, try to text what you have to Stevie.
1950380	1954260	He hits Z again on his keyboard.
1954260	1956140	Okay, I don't feel very good.
1956140	1957100	I know, little guy.
1957100	1959140	Little guy with the big thighs, eh?
1959660	1960700	We're gonna take care of you, right?
1960700	1964140	Stevie, can we go to a doctor or something?
1964140	1965340	We could get to a hospital.
1965340	1968900	Is that, and she's like kinda eyeing Greg?
1968900	1969900	Well, here's what we could do.
1969900	1971780	We could either drop him off at a hospital
1971780	1974220	or you can leave him and Greg in my basement.
1974220	1976980	I'll watch him while you and Beck make the cut.
1977980	1978820	Luke's face.
1978820	1981820	Why would you drop me off in the basement?
1981820	1984700	Well, it's whether you wanna go to a hospital or not.
1984700	1987100	I mean, Julius doesn't wanna go to the hospital.
1987100	1988060	What does Luke want?
1988060	1990220	I don't know what Luke wants.
1990220	1992060	These are just, these are the options.
1992060	1993020	Luke's along for the ride.
1993020	1993860	What does Julius want?
1993860	1995020	I'm playing the character.
1995020	1997580	Julius wants to go cut this shit together.
1998500	1999340	Fuck yeah.
2000940	2003060	He's got two hit points left, so.
2003060	2005080	You look such a mess.
2005080	2006180	It's so funny.
2006180	2009860	Like you are trying to hold on by a thread at this point
2009860	2013460	and it's still a fair amount of car ride left.
2013460	2015060	Okay, why don't you,
2015060	2018020	we'll get God situated in the basement and.
2018020	2020220	And I'll go help cut the news together.
2020220	2022300	Yeah, you'll show Stevie the ropes.
2022300	2024220	And maybe we'll call an ambulance.
2024220	2026420	Maybe we'll call an ambulance.
2026420	2027860	Yeah, yeah, man.
2027860	2031260	Roll Constitution to see if you can actually stay awake
2031260	2032420	all the way into town.
2033540	2034780	An eight on a 50.
2034780	2036380	An eight on a 50's gonna keep you.
2036380	2039540	The prospect of not being able to cut this together,
2039540	2042020	adrenaline pumps through his veins.
2042020	2044340	And the consistent rings of yes we can.
2044340	2046180	Yes, exactly.
2046180	2047020	Yes we can.
2048460	2049300	Yes we can.
2049300	2051660	Dopamine fills his brain every time he hears that.
2051660	2052500	Yes we can.
2052500	2053340	Yes we can.
2053340	2054160	Yes we can.
2054160	2055000	Yes we can.
2055000	2055840	Yes we can.
2055840	2056660	I can do it.
2056660	2057500	I can.
2057500	2058340	I can keep it together.
2058340	2060980	All right, as we roll into the city,
2060980	2061940	what's the first stop?
2061940	2063380	And also I'm gonna go pee again.
2063380	2064740	Sorry I drank so much liquid.
2064740	2065600	What is the first stop?
2065600	2066700	We haven't really hammered out
2066700	2068540	what our order of operations here.
2068540	2072580	I mean, Julius is gonna say the news tower or whatever.
2072580	2073460	I'm a little nervous.
2073460	2074700	I think Beck would be nervous too
2074700	2077860	about leaving Godel unconscious in the van.
2078580	2079480	That he could pop up at any moment.
2079480	2082300	I don't know if I can deal with God alone.
2082300	2085800	So Stevie can handle the cut if he passes out
2085800	2088420	or goes to the emergency room or something like that, right?
2088420	2091460	Can you stay here in the basement with me and watch God?
2091460	2094940	I mean, yeah, but like I know what all the footage is.
2094940	2096500	Like that's kind of my whole thing
2096500	2099020	is to like tell him the edit.
2099020	2099860	I mean.
2099860	2101980	Let's just bring him with us.
2101980	2103700	That is such a bad idea.
2104340	2109220	Julius nods his head.
2109220	2111100	Why don't we just lock him in your basement
2111100	2112540	and then go do the cut?
2112540	2113820	Julius nods his head.
2113820	2115660	I mean, someone has to stay with him.
2115660	2117260	I guess that'll be me.
2117260	2118620	I don't know about that, dude.
2118620	2120240	Like you said, it's God.
2120240	2123280	Like if he does wake up, what are you gonna do?
2123280	2125260	Well, that's why I asked one of you to stay with me
2125260	2127460	but you all wanna be a part of this fucking cut.
2127460	2130800	So I don't know.
2130800	2132180	Is the cut more important
2132220	2134060	than keeping God trapped in my basement?
2134060	2136380	I don't know, Beck, but.
2136380	2137220	That's my point though.
2137220	2139860	It's like, what are two people versus God?
2139860	2144860	Like what if we all leave and go get a turtle
2145060	2147700	on our way back from cutting the film footage?
2147700	2148920	Julius nods his head.
2152140	2152980	I don't know Beck,
2152980	2154940	but I don't think we can just leave him alone.
2154940	2158220	I mean, I'm gonna stay with Greg.
2158220	2161620	Especially since Julius is seemingly staying.
2161900	2162960	This is not a huge deal,
2162960	2166020	but just would you not use the upstairs bathroom
2167820	2168660	while you're there?
2168660	2169560	Is there a-
2169560	2170860	There's a downstairs bathroom.
2170860	2171700	Okay, cool.
2171700	2173500	Yeah, no, as long as there's another one.
2173500	2175140	And I don't mean on the main floor.
2175140	2177060	If you do need to go up there for any reason
2177060	2178060	to use the kitchen or anything,
2178060	2179220	I just mean the one upstairs.
2179220	2180620	There's just still some of,
2180620	2181460	there's just still,
2181460	2182740	there's some things my wife left
2182740	2184980	that I haven't really touched.
2184980	2185820	Wait, hold on.
2185820	2188060	Why'd you say, oh, that's horrifying.
2188060	2189860	Did she poop in your toilet?
2189860	2191060	Oh, if that's what you mean,
2191340	2192180	I take back the awe.
2192180	2194860	No, I think it's the way that it's messily arranged,
2194860	2195700	the way that she would have it.
2195700	2197300	So that got her hairbrush out and-
2197300	2198140	Yeah, that's what I meant too.
2198140	2200180	And she had smeared all of the walls.
2200180	2202320	No, there were, yes,
2202320	2203160	the hairbrush,
2204060	2204900	the tooth brace,
2204900	2206260	which she never closed,
2206260	2207220	some toiletries,
2207220	2208660	and of course a bowl of shit.
2211260	2212160	Please, whatever you do,
2212160	2213740	do not flush the upstairs toilet.
2213740	2215500	I just can't bring myself to flush it.
2215500	2220500	Am I the only one who thought that?
2222460	2223300	I think so.
2228100	2229340	Yeah, okay.
2229340	2230180	That's fine.
2230180	2231000	If Taylor dies,
2231000	2232900	I'm throwing all of her stuff away immediately.
2234500	2237140	In the secret house you two share together?
2237140	2238700	No, that was me as Zach.
2238700	2239540	I knew it.
2239540	2240380	Whoa.
2240380	2241200	Whoa.
2241200	2242040	I got that.
2242040	2243740	You were pretending to be a person?
2246220	2248460	Was that the world's fastest no back button?
2250780	2255340	So we'll get you guys all secured in my basement
2255340	2257420	and hopefully you and Greg will be fine there.
2257420	2259860	And then we'll go edit this cut together
2259860	2260960	like a news crew should.
2260960	2262020	And bring back a turtle.
2262020	2263860	And bring back a new god turtle.
2263860	2264700	Okay, sick.
2264700	2267740	So let's hear about the outside of Cal Colorado's house.
2267740	2269220	What are we pulling up to?
2269220	2270560	What's the vibe?
2270560	2273520	Oh, I mean, nice ass neighborhood.
2273520	2276880	Stately like early 20th century or late 1800s
2276880	2277760	like townhouses.
2277760	2278600	Some of them are brick.
2278600	2279560	His is painted white.
2279560	2281600	It's probably like three stories maybe.
2281600	2282420	Whoa.
2282420	2284320	And you know, it's narrow, right?
2284320	2285460	It's in the middle of the city.
2285460	2287280	And yeah, I don't know what time of year it is
2287280	2288800	but it seems like it's fall there.
2288800	2289880	It's like nice.
2289880	2291480	But it seems like it's fall.
2291480	2294200	It's like June 18th or somewhere around there.
2294200	2295780	Specifically July something.
2296720	2297840	We did start in June.
2297840	2299160	I have June 18th written down.
2299160	2300640	Today is July 5th.
2300640	2301840	Oh, okay, yeah.
2301880	2304320	So there's all these 4th of July banners and stuff.
2304320	2306560	Cal has a big American flag outside the front.
2306560	2307400	Nice.
2307400	2308960	And yeah, you see a neat little,
2308960	2311800	like a couple of like garden, whoops.
2311800	2313040	What the hell's happening?
2313040	2314880	It's the helicopter landing at the hospital.
2314880	2315840	Helicopter.
2315840	2316680	Cal says, don't worry.
2316680	2319440	That's just the helicopter landing at the hospital nearby.
2320440	2321560	Thank God it's closed.
2321560	2322640	Yeah.
2322640	2325240	So there's some nice little like window planners and shit.
2325240	2326800	Julius, I could just like run you over there
2326800	2327920	while they get situated.
2327920	2328760	That's true.
2328760	2329580	We have time.
2329940	2334220	This isn't, I mean, it was sunset when we left.
2334220	2335140	It's been a few hours.
2335140	2336660	This is not going on tonight's news.
2336660	2338300	We have all day to cut this thing.
2338300	2341420	We could definitely get you some medical attention.
2341420	2342260	That's right, yeah.
2342260	2344860	It's like 11, 1130 p.m. now at this point.
2344860	2347540	Maybe that is the order of operations now.
2347540	2349500	Yeah, it's, oh my God, it's too,
2349500	2351920	how did we not realize it's too late to go on the news?
2351920	2356180	Because it's been a pretty discombobulating day of a day,
2356180	2357020	has it not?
2357020	2358580	Julius texts his uncle to see
2358580	2360740	if his health insurance has kicked in yet.
2360740	2361580	Yeah.
2369020	2370100	Commentary.
2370100	2372260	That is a great question.
2372260	2375980	Sax, oh, Sax consulting the fucking can.
2375980	2377780	Who has insurance or nothing.
2377780	2378940	I had to check.
2378940	2382300	It's like I made a full HR department for these guys.
2382300	2383940	It's part of my world building process.
2383940	2385420	Extensive employee records.
2385420	2387540	It's like, oh, nope, sorry Julius.
2387540	2389900	That doesn't kick in until the end of the month.
2390780	2391740	Oh, City Action News,
2391740	2395020	they actually don't provide healthcare coverage.
2395020	2396500	Not to junior producers.
2398340	2399820	Then call the chopper.
2399820	2402420	Call the chopper.
2402420	2404900	No, again, it is just several blocks away.
2404900	2408900	And we're in the driveway of this beautiful brick
2408900	2409980	three-story town home.
2409980	2412020	We didn't want to leave God alone in the van.
2412020	2414180	Can we leave Julius alone in the van for a second
2414180	2415580	while we unload or?
2415580	2416620	I'll help.
2416740	2420780	What if you just sit right there for a moment?
2420780	2422140	Keep writing your notes.
2422140	2422980	Oh yeah.
2422980	2425420	So I imagine we just kind of all like take them in
2425420	2427060	and get them situated.
2427060	2430020	There's probably a nice like couch and like sofa and shit.
2430020	2433340	Julius flops down on there and continues writing his notes.
2433340	2435220	I didn't think you came down to the basement with us.
2435220	2437220	I was like blindly following behind
2437220	2439100	while I typed in my notes.
2439100	2440620	Oh, we were saying stay in the van.
2440620	2443820	Yeah, no, he's following blindly behind you.
2443820	2446100	I'm just trying to get us out of here quick, dude.
2447620	2449460	He's following you guys.
2449460	2450900	Don't you want to go to the fucking hospital?
2450900	2452420	Who's holding Fox?
2452420	2453340	How do we get there?
2453340	2454460	That's what I was saying.
2454460	2456020	I like, I imagine.
2456020	2456860	Cal and Stevie.
2456860	2458300	Yeah, exactly.
2458300	2462380	So he is still absolutely drenched.
2462380	2463220	Yeah.
2463220	2465700	Sopping, making puddles everywhere
2465700	2467220	that you're pulling him.
2467220	2470720	Cal, like you can see this place is clean
2470720	2473220	and Cal like visibly winces.
2473220	2475380	And he's like, do you guys have this?
2475380	2476700	Do you guys, do you guys got this?
2476700	2478820	I need to mop some of this up.
2478820	2479860	I'll put some tea on.
2479860	2482780	And as soon as Cal steps away and says,
2482780	2484180	I'll put some tea on.
2484180	2486940	You see the face of Fox,
2486940	2489580	Godel, Greg Godel, God Godel,
2489580	2492060	slowly start to twitch.
2492060	2492900	I punch him.
2498180	2500180	Roll initiative with God.
2500180	2502780	Okay, so you're just gonna roll damage
2502780	2505060	cause you're right there.
2506060	2507540	What's a fist punch?
2507540	2509020	It's a D four minus one.
2511100	2512220	Oh shit.
2512220	2513180	One minus one.
2513180	2514940	I rolled a one minus one.
2517620	2520580	You wake him up like fully.
2524020	2526980	Stevie's looking at me like, what the fuck dude?
2526980	2528900	I'm sorry, I thought I would like knock him out again.
2528900	2531580	Immediately his mouth is just foaming
2531580	2534620	and like this almost sea foam is pouring out of it.
2535140	2538260	And it smells and you think that you might actually
2538260	2540620	as the sea foam is like pouring up out
2540620	2543140	and coming out of his mouth and he's fighting.
2543140	2545180	I need a first a grip check
2545180	2547260	for this coming out of fucking nowhere.
2547260	2549540	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
2549540	2550620	Cal fails.
2550620	2551460	Fail.
2551460	2552300	Beck passes.
2552300	2553460	Pass.
2553460	2554420	Crit fail.
2554420	2556260	Crit fail.
2556260	2557940	I imagine we're like on the stairwell
2557940	2558940	going down into the basement.
2558940	2559780	Yeah.
2559780	2562100	Okay, so Cal who has like been turning around fully
2562100	2564620	just like scrambles backwards up the stairs
2564620	2567180	and runs into the like into his kitchen.
2567180	2568140	But right before you do,
2568140	2572540	Joe takes off his headphones and Joe you lose zero grip.
2572540	2576180	However, the other two headphones off sir, thank you.
2577780	2579860	Julius wasn't looking until Beck yelled,
2579860	2580900	I'm gonna punch him.
2582460	2583580	So this is Joe's fault.
2583580	2586660	You're gonna lose Cal one D four plus one,
2586660	2589100	which with the crit fail means that Julius
2589100	2591500	automatically loses five grip.
2591940	2593900	I see my breaking point.
2593900	2595340	We got a breaking point
2595340	2600300	and you lose two grip Cal as the both of you see
2600300	2604060	is that fingertips reaching out through the top
2604060	2608620	by a little Stevie wonder of the sea foam at the mouth
2608620	2611780	and like maybe a finger trying to grip at the lip
2611780	2613860	and then suddenly it's gone and you just see the water
2613860	2615820	and then it's just foaming at the mouth
2615820	2618660	and there are multiple hands, multiple fingers
2618660	2622740	reaching up through the foam, trying to get out.
2622740	2625860	He closes his mouth shut tight and continues to wriggle.
2625860	2627100	I'm gonna burn Joe back.
2627100	2629540	I didn't hit my bringing point, I almost did though.
2629540	2630420	I did math wrong.
2631300	2632140	That makes sense
2632140	2633340	cause you already hit your breaking point.
2633340	2634980	Yeah, I'm two away though.
2634980	2636500	But you did lose five grip.
2636500	2640060	So Luke, I need a fight flight freeze.
2640060	2643060	I'll go top in that order flight flight freeze.
2643060	2645140	And freeze is a one.
2645140	2645980	Five.
2645980	2646820	What is that?
2646820	2647640	That's fight.
2647640	2648480	The top answer?
2649200	2650040	So what do you do?
2650040	2651040	Punch him in the nose.
2652720	2655680	Julius thinks he's this guy has to shut his mouth
2655680	2657080	and he's gonna just like go
2657080	2659720	and like put his hand over his mouth and nose.
2660720	2661680	Oh my God, okay.
2661680	2662560	You do so.
2662560	2664280	Roll unarmed combat
2664280	2666480	and he's gonna roll at a massive disadvantage
2666480	2671080	because his arms are behind his back with his wrists tied.
2671080	2671920	Not all of them.
2671920	2673600	He had a 41 on a 60.
2674520	2675960	And with the success,
2675960	2678760	Julius Summers has his hands over the mouth
2678760	2680860	and nose of Greg Gottel.
2682440	2684320	Cal was thinking something very, very similar
2684320	2686040	as he was running up those stairs.
2686040	2687940	And so he's trying to grab some duct tape
2687940	2689440	from his utility drawer in the kitchen
2689440	2690720	cause this seems untenable.
2690720	2692320	Julius, Julius, be careful.
2692320	2693160	Like don't kill him.
2693160	2694280	Like just make sure he passes out,
2694280	2695120	but then you gotta stop.
2695120	2696180	Make sure that mouth stays shut.
2696180	2697020	Help him.
2697020	2697840	Help him.
2697840	2698720	Julius nods.
2698720	2699560	What are you doing back?
2699560	2700380	What am I seeing?
2700380	2703240	You are seeing Julius like plugging the nose
2703240	2705740	and mouth of this dude.
2706460	2709100	Stevie grabs and is like,
2709100	2711060	not the nose, not the nose, just the mouth.
2711060	2712020	He's not budging.
2712020	2712840	Nope.
2712840	2713680	She can't stop him.
2713680	2716660	I put my hands over both of Julius's hands
2716660	2720260	and my goal is to, when I feel Gottel passing out,
2720260	2721580	I wanna pull him away.
2721580	2722660	We can't kill him, Julius.
2722660	2723620	We can't kill him.
2723620	2726060	If we kill him, that God thing will pop into one of us
2726060	2727060	and then we're fucked.
2727060	2728260	Don't kill him, Julius.
2728260	2730200	I'll be right there.
2730200	2731040	Julius nods.
2731040	2734560	Okay, let's get a human role here
2734560	2737320	from Beck Wilder to see if you can feel
2737320	2741280	or you can go for one of the like first aid type roles
2741280	2742100	if you have that.
2742100	2743000	I'm gonna take the human.
2743000	2744080	Okay.
2744080	2744920	I pass.
2744920	2746140	12 on a 40 human.
2746140	2749800	Okay, so as Cal Colorado comes running back down the stairs
2749800	2752600	with duct tape and Stevie is trying to like push
2752600	2755480	at the arms and hands of Julius Summers,
2755480	2758220	you feel on the arms of Julius
2758220	2762380	the kind of release of consciousness from Greg Gottel.
2762380	2764340	And she's like, that's super bad for you.
2764340	2765180	What are you doing?
2765180	2767740	We got to, it's not as bad as like death though.
2767740	2768580	It's okay.
2768580	2770280	And I'm trying to pull.
2771700	2772540	It's okay.
2772540	2774580	Cal's got a big thing of duct tape stripped out
2774580	2775740	and he's like, okay, okay.
2775740	2777460	Real quick, Julius, move your hands.
2777460	2778300	I'm gonna tape them.
2778300	2779460	One, two.
2780500	2782740	And I started rapping and rapping and rapping.
2782740	2785500	Yo, yo, yo, my name is Cal.
2785500	2788060	My name is Cal Colorado and I'm here to say
2788740	2790660	that you're gonna wrap your mouth in a serious way.
2792180	2795860	All right, you've got duct tape all around the mouth
2795860	2800860	and jaw and neck of Greg Gottel and he is unconscious.
2801500	2804100	And Stevie is like, let's at least like, you know,
2804100	2805740	make him comfortable again.
2805740	2807580	Can we please like, this is.
2807580	2809740	And you see like she's pleading with you.
2809740	2811580	Yeah, no, of course.
2811580	2813020	Let's get him to the couch downstairs.
2813020	2815820	I just want to apologize that I hit your God brother.
2815820	2819660	No, it's, it was just a reflex like he was waking up.
2819660	2820900	Sorry, your mayor brother.
2820900	2822080	Your mayor God brother.
2822080	2822920	Your brother.
2822920	2824200	Your little mayor God brother.
2825540	2826980	She's just staring at the ground.
2826980	2828100	Looks up at both of you.
2828100	2828940	It's fine.
2828940	2830380	Let's get him secured down here.
2830380	2831220	How?
2831220	2832060	Yeah, I don't know.
2832060	2832880	Sit on him.
2833880	2834840	You've got that duct tape.
2834840	2837540	Could we like, is there like a something sturdy down here?
2837540	2840060	We could just duct tape, duct tape.
2840060	2841220	I've got some tie downs.
2841220	2846220	I've got some tie down straps and in the utility closet,
2847180	2850940	I could, we can, we can strap them to this couch.
2850940	2851860	Yeah, let's do it.
2851860	2853980	Julie's is just kind of staring off.
2853980	2855580	Okay, let's be gentle.
2855580	2860040	And Stevie is helping you use all of this roll of duct tape.
2860040	2860880	Yeah.
2860880	2863600	And all these straps and you use the rest of the roll
2863600	2865420	of duct tape to secure the.
2865420	2866900	I don't think we need the duct tape that
2866900	2868060	she wants comfort, right?
2868420	2870100	It's, I just.
2870100	2872180	As they're like putting on more and more duct tape
2872180	2873980	staring at you as you're like, I'm not sure about that.
2873980	2877420	They're like, but if they get out, they want the comfort,
2877420	2881340	but Stevie is very worried about what happens if.
2881340	2882180	Yeah.
2882180	2883020	Yeah, understandable.
2883020	2886140	So I am gonna crank these straps kind of hard
2886140	2887820	and he starts ratcheting down.
2887820	2888740	I gotta go.
2888740	2890580	She just gonna walk upstairs.
2890580	2892420	Like this is becoming a lot.
2892420	2893740	Yeah, yeah.
2893740	2895220	Could you, could you check on the T?
2895220	2897220	Yes, absolutely.
2897220	2898260	Anyone else?
2899420	2903520	All right, I'll take your silence as a no T answer.
2903520	2907420	But everyone is just dazed as, it's been a long.
2907420	2909460	Stevie ratchet also.
2909460	2912420	Stevie in the front right door of the fridge.
2912420	2914940	There's some energy drink, the kind you like Beck.
2914940	2916660	Sorry, the cat is making it sound like
2916660	2918020	I'm touching my mic stand.
2918020	2919380	It's not me, it's the cat.
2920340	2921180	So we've got him ratcheted down.
2921180	2923100	The cat touched my mic stand.
2923100	2924960	I swear it wasn't me dude.
2924960	2927760	If he's ratcheted down Beck would happily go upstairs
2927760	2929280	to grab an energy drink.
2929280	2931720	You said you liked it that time you came to my house
2931720	2932640	three and a half years ago.
2932640	2934200	So I keep some around now.
2934200	2935880	Oh dude, thanks.
2935880	2938280	Is it three and a half years old or?
2938280	2940560	No, no, I replace them every six months.
2940560	2942720	Oh dude, Cal.
2942720	2944760	That's so thoughtful of you, man.
2944760	2946000	You're a great camera man.
2946000	2947160	Oh, thanks Cal.
2947160	2948600	You're a great anchor.
2948600	2950280	Thank you, I will be again.
2950280	2953180	Dude, you're gonna be like the anchor
2953180	2954720	after this story gets out.
2955360	2956560	This is like 9-11, isn't it?
2956560	2957800	Okay, so I'm picturing.
2957800	2960200	Julius hears the word story and perks up.
2960200	2961660	I was picturing this whole time.
2961660	2963940	They're having this conversation in the kitchen
2963940	2966920	and Julius is just standing at the top of the stairs
2966920	2969280	out of view from them listening
2969280	2971400	and just picking at his face.
2971400	2972800	Oh God.
2972800	2975280	In the darkness of the basement stairwell.
2975280	2978520	One hand typing barely legible notes
2978520	2980800	on what is gonna go into the edit
2980800	2983040	and the other just peeling skin.
2983040	2984440	You do hear at that moment.
2985040	2986960	Julius, what do you like to drink?
2986960	2988040	Energy drink.
2988040	2989900	There's a whole six pack.
2989900	2991200	Would you like some?
2991200	2994240	He kind of wanders over there, still doing both things.
2994240	2998840	And now that you have Greg Godel secured in the basement
2998840	3002940	and the four of you are sharing caffeine in the kitchen.
3002940	3004520	Let's call that ambulance, huh?
3004520	3005580	It's close enough.
3006520	3009760	Yeah, let's just walk with our tea and energy drinks.
3009760	3010680	It's a nice day.
3010680	3011880	I don't have insurance.
3011880	3013800	It is nice being back in the city.
3014920	3016480	Where everyone knows your name.
3016480	3020160	Julius sniffs as in like, it's nice to smell the air again.
3020160	3022920	Does he smell regular air or is it?
3022920	3025120	It is exactly what you think it smells like.
3025120	3026200	Uh-oh.
3026200	3029960	Or that could mean, I don't know what that means.
3029960	3031000	I don't know what that means.
3031000	3031880	What do you think it smells like?
3031880	3033180	It's why I asked, I don't know.
3033180	3035160	Yeah, it smells like that.
3035160	3038200	Okay, he's happily walking to the hospital,
3038200	3040720	peeling his skin and losing blood.
3040720	3044200	No, we're, as you like you walk out the front door
3044840	3045680	and just start strolling down there
3045680	3047000	and we're like, we grab you by the shoulders
3047000	3048740	and we're like, no, no, no, no, get in the can van,
3048740	3050280	get in the can van.
3050280	3051980	Come on, we're driving you.
3051980	3053240	He allows it.
3053240	3054800	Do I stay here?
3054800	3056140	Is that okay or?
3056140	3057900	Yeah, Stevie, you stay here.
3057900	3059520	We're gonna get him some medical attention
3059520	3061240	and then as soon as they've got them checked up,
3061240	3064640	I think we're pulling an all-nighter down at the station.
3064640	3067720	Okay, all right, well, you have my number, so.
3067720	3068560	Of course.
3068560	3070680	If anything happens there, let me know.
3070680	3071680	No can intern.
3071680	3076080	I'll let you know if anything happens on my end, obviously.
3076920	3079680	You know your number one job here, right?
3079680	3082300	Don't let Greg kill himself.
3082300	3084400	Right, yes, obvious, I mean, yeah.
3084400	3085620	Stevie, if I had more time,
3085620	3088020	I would help you move my collection of antique steak knives
3088020	3090360	out of the basement, but we've really got to get,
3093880	3096560	really got to get out of here and get him to the hospital
3096560	3098000	and then get this thing cut.
3098000	3099320	I think you can handle that, right?
3099320	3103160	Hard cut to the steak knife collection in the basement
3103160	3106680	and swift cut back to you guys waving goodbye.
3107920	3111580	Here's a glass case full of like all these blocks of knives.
3114040	3115960	Full fucking wooden sets.
3115960	3118520	But there is a thing that says, do not touch on us.
3118520	3119360	Oh, that might help.
3119360	3120200	There you go.
3120200	3121020	That might help.
3123880	3124720	Okay.
3124720	3126280	I feel so much better, Julius says,
3126280	3128440	after spending some time in the hospital.
3130320	3133000	I'm glad, says Cal, Colorado,
3133000	3135760	after sitting in the waiting room playing with TikTok.
3135760	3139340	I need you to stay overnight, says the nurse.
3139340	3140180	Oh.
3140180	3141880	Julius winks and agrees.
3141880	3142720	All right.
3145920	3147920	Guess it's you and me on the edit, Beck.
3150160	3151760	And the two of you.
3151760	3154480	Like we're standing by his hospital bed while she says this?
3154480	3155320	Yeah.
3155320	3156160	Or like in the emergency room,
3156160	3157800	they just got him in the hallway on a bed.
3157840	3159920	Like ma'am, there is some news tonight.
3159920	3161360	Do you happen to recognize me?
3161360	3163060	Cal, Colorado city action news.
3163060	3163900	And I wink.
3164880	3165720	49.
3166840	3167880	So yeah.
3167880	3168720	Yeah.
3168720	3169560	Oh, oh yeah.
3169560	3170520	Call Colorado.
3170520	3172600	Um, well, as you know, the news never sleeps.
3172600	3173440	Of course not.
3173440	3174720	But this man needs to,
3174720	3177840	his face is broken in like multiple places.
3177840	3179140	We need to do CAT scans.
3179140	3180400	We need to do X-rays.
3180400	3181520	We need to draw blood.
3181520	3182520	Sounds expensive.
3182520	3184300	Let's just give me a Tylenol.
3184300	3185960	Or, you know, something stronger.
3185960	3187040	Anything that can.
3187120	3188840	Let's just get him back on his feet for now.
3188840	3190040	And then like we can bring him back.
3190040	3191160	We'll bring him back in the morning.
3191160	3192000	Right, yes.
3192000	3193680	I'll be back for sure.
3193680	3195040	1 p.m. at the latest.
3195040	3196000	She starts laughing.
3196000	3198040	She's like, I gotta be honest with you.
3198040	3201020	I'm not sure if legally I'm allowed to let him leave.
3201020	3201860	No, that makes a lot of sense.
3201860	3203760	I'm not sure if you're legally allowed to make me stay.
3203760	3207180	Okay, that's scary and fine.
3207180	3208760	Why did you come here?
3208760	3210080	For something quick.
3210080	3211160	It's the hospital.
3211160	3213400	If you want something quick, go to Walgreens.
3213400	3215520	You got better stuff than Walgreens?
3215520	3218200	Yeah, but we're gonna need to book you overnight
3218200	3220000	to put fluids in you.
3220000	3221520	This is Cal, Colorado.
3221520	3222800	If you could just help us out.
3222800	3225000	We will have him back in the morning.
3225000	3227880	But he refuses to not be a part of the news.
3229000	3231800	We're just asking, you can clean up his cuts
3231800	3233400	and make sure that.
3233400	3234600	I wanna try a persuade role on him.
3234600	3235680	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3235680	3237440	And go ahead and assist.
3237440	3241080	You can add a plus 20, the two of you, if you succeed.
3241080	3242200	Yep, success.
3242200	3243480	So plus 20.
3243480	3245240	Oh, and he already succeeded.
3246280	3247440	I passed my persuade.
3247440	3248280	Oh.
3248280	3249360	A 46 on a 50.
3249360	3252320	That plus 40, which puts me over, and I fail.
3252320	3253160	Oh.
3253160	3253980	Oh.
3253980	3254820	Oh.
3254820	3255660	Oh.
3255660	3256480	Oh.
3256480	3257320	Oh.
3257320	3258160	We are way too convinced.
3258160	3260000	The dice work in the worst way ever.
3260000	3260840	What a shame.
3260840	3262520	She's like, uh, yeah, whatever you guys want.
3262520	3264320	And you're all like, he should stay here.
3264320	3265160	Oh.
3265160	3265980	Oh.
3265980	3266820	Oh.
3266820	3268880	Those are pain pills, you're putting them in pain.
3268880	3272120	Yeah, I can do like a steroid shot.
3272120	3274160	I can give you half a D6, I guess,
3274160	3275400	if you're not gonna stay overnight.
3276220	3277060	Half a D6 plus one.
3277060	3277880	Not a chance.
3277880	3278720	Wink.
3280000	3282800	Half of three is two.
3284160	3287040	So yeah, you go up from two hit points to four hit points,
3287040	3288880	which is quite substantial.
3288880	3290040	Plenty of hit points.
3290040	3291520	Well then unfortunately we do get to the point
3291520	3293540	where we're looking at you only two hit points better,
3293540	3295400	and we're like, maybe you should stay.
3295400	3300400	I thought you would be better.
3301680	3305200	It's just the fact that a couple of the cuts
3305960	3308480	have now been like pushed together with a bandaid,
3308480	3311440	like the kind of butterfly kind of holding
3311440	3312400	the pieces together.
3312400	3315880	And then currently you've got fluids going into you,
3315880	3318640	and you've also, they're gonna do blood work.
3318640	3320320	No they're not, he gets up.
3320320	3321160	Okay.
3321160	3326000	And I take these two a day, twice a day.
3326000	3328500	You know, your nurse always gives you your medicine.
3328500	3329960	I'll be back tomorrow.
3329960	3331200	It's just a little something something
3331200	3332920	from our personal stash.
3332920	3335640	You all succeeded on your persuade checks.
3337080	3338960	She's like, okay, here's some of the good stuff.
3338960	3339880	And?
3339880	3342200	Two a day, twice a day keeps the demons away.
3342200	3345080	Again, like I said, we'll be back 1 p.m.
3345080	3345940	two at the latest.
3345940	3348040	To get him, you know, the full treatment.
3348040	3350240	Maybe like 24 hours from now,
3350240	3352520	if he does want to stay up till nine to watch his segment.
3352520	3353360	I don't know.
3353360	3354200	We'll see, but.
3354200	3357240	I can watch the segment from the hospital.
3357240	3359200	That's remarkably mature of you.
3359200	3360320	Let's fucking go.
3360320	3363840	Vroom vroom, the can-van speeds.
3363840	3366040	As you're heading out down the hallway,
3366040	3369720	you hear a man hiccup and shit his pants at the same time.
3369720	3371720	Julia says, hm, cucumbers?
3371720	3372720	That could be a story.
3372720	3375240	Camera goes right back to the vroom vroom of the can-van
3375240	3380240	as you head back down to the city action news HQ.
3380360	3382300	We see the columns, we see the glass,
3382300	3385040	we see the beautiful moss, we saw the landscaping,
3385040	3388640	we see the marble-less floor as you enter.
3388640	3389720	I miss that marble.
3390680	3393440	It's the three of you, rolling in, ready to go,
3393440	3394960	as you hit the edit bay.
3394960	3398440	We are rolling Julius in in a hospital wheelchair.
3398440	3400160	Oh, nice, wheelchair to go.
3400160	3402020	We bump the doors open with his legs.
3402020	3404800	As Julius is- Roll a date for it?
3404800	3405640	As Julius is-
3405640	3409460	I run.
3411120	3413520	As Julius is wheeled in, he's thinking,
3413520	3414840	but he says it out loud.
3414840	3416400	He's like, I'll be Raylan now.
3416400	3417240	Raylan?
3417720	3418560	It's your-
3418560	3420920	That's my family's name,
3420920	3423360	but they've always considered me not a Raylan.
3423360	3425680	Julius, remember what I was telling Stevie.
3425680	3427300	You don't have to be your family.
3427300	3428880	You can be your own man.
3428880	3429720	A newsman.
3429720	3431280	Julius nods.
3431280	3432640	After what we've been through,
3432640	3434800	I definitely feel closer to you guys.
3434800	3437480	I mean, yeah, that was the craziest thing
3437480	3438920	that's ever happened in my life.
3438920	3440720	That was the third craziest thing
3440720	3442200	that's ever happened in my life.
3442200	3443480	Let's show the people.
3445000	3446600	Wait, what, Cal?
3446840	3449040	Vivica pops out of the editing bay
3449040	3452080	and is like doing a big stretch of her shoulders
3452080	3453960	and then pops her knuckles.
3453960	3455560	And she's like, oh, hey guys, sorry.
3455560	3457720	I'm actually heading out for the night pretty beat,
3457720	3460020	but do you want me to take care of anything
3460020	3460960	for you guys before I go?
3460960	3461800	Or are you good to go?
3461800	3462940	Do we need her help on this
3462940	3464400	or do we know what we're doing?
3464400	3466760	I think Beck would know enough.
3466760	3467920	He's not an editor,
3467920	3470040	but he would know enough about how to edit.
3470040	3473440	Like he normally does want Vivica there to do the editing.
3473440	3474280	Sure.
3474280	3475960	But I think, I look at Cal and Julius,
3475960	3478240	I think maybe we should handle this one
3478240	3479760	or do you want like a professional
3479760	3480600	set of eyes on this? She gives you
3480600	3481420	an inquisitive look.
3481420	3482260	She's like, what do you mean?
3482260	3484080	Is it anything like super intense?
3484080	3486200	Vivica, how did you get your job here?
3486200	3488760	Oh, that is a big question.
3488760	3491860	Yeah, no, I went to school, applied, intern,
3491860	3494120	got the job, kept moving up, started getting paid,
3494120	3495660	get health insurance next year.
3495660	3498040	Have you ever, oh, yes.
3498040	3499480	So you're what, 10 years in?
3499480	3500320	Yeah.
3501000	3506000	Have you ever worked for the Godel company?
3506120	3506960	No.
3506960	3508300	You might want to see this.
3508300	3509140	Okay, yeah.
3509140	3511260	I mean, if you've got some juicy goss,
3511260	3513240	I'll get the tea brewing.
3513240	3515880	Vivica, do you want to edit the biggest news story
3515880	3517200	since 9-11?
3517200	3520080	She gives you just like the biggest eyes,
3520080	3522840	kind of brows waggling about.
3522840	3525200	I bet you would, but we have to do this one on our own.
3525200	3528240	Oh, you can't just leave me hanging like that, what?
3529240	3530080	Vivica, I forgot.
3530080	3531960	There's something that you can't know about
3531960	3533200	that's in this footage.
3533200	3534360	That is actually what I forgot.
3534360	3536200	She can't know about the God shit.
3536200	3537160	Fuck you guys.
3537160	3541520	And she grabs the door and heads back into the editing bay.
3541520	3543020	She goes back into the editing bay.
3543020	3544440	She's like, I'm going to edit this.
3544440	3545840	If you guys are going to be weird about it,
3545840	3546960	I want to see.
3546960	3551400	Oh, how do we decide if we can trust her?
3551400	3554120	Guys, Vivica is like one of my best friend,
3554120	3555520	coworker friends here.
3555520	3556760	She's always had my back.
3556800	3559440	And I mean, obviously she's never seen anything like this,
3559440	3560280	but-
3560280	3561960	Is she like religious?
3561960	3563360	I don't think so.
3563360	3565920	They're like looking in through the glass door
3565920	3567880	that's kind of tinted at her.
3567880	3570040	And she's like bringing the computer back up.
3570040	3572320	She's getting the programs going, yeah.
3572320	3573600	And she's good at what she does.
3573600	3575560	I mean, we're going to have a good looking piece
3575560	3577440	if she's ever fingerprints on it.
3577440	3580200	Julius was thinking about like us editing it
3580200	3582920	versus the quality of having her help us.
3582920	3583760	And it's gotta be-
3583760	3586280	It's a charming amateurism versus...
3586760	3588440	It might be the individual life,
3588440	3591200	but it will be a greatly edited segment, right?
3591200	3593040	Here's the deal though, guys.
3593040	3595720	I could just like, I think I should just like
3595720	3598800	not give her the time codes for the stuff with Fox.
3598800	3599640	Perfect.
3599640	3601840	If you can pre-scan the footage and yeah.
3601840	3602680	Yeah.
3602680	3604240	So that's in the earlier episodes,
3604240	3606520	that's one of Beck's things is that he has like an eidetic,
3606520	3609320	is an eidetic memory of like the footage that he has
3610560	3611680	where it is on the,
3611680	3614120	he knows of the timestamps of everything you shot.
3614120	3615920	So he just won't give her those timestamps.
3616520	3618120	Who was making that crazy noise?
3618120	3619600	That was me.
3621600	3624280	I had a bunch of spit in my mouth from burping a bunch
3624280	3625320	and I had to swallow it.
3625320	3627440	We have got to get Luke to a hospital, guys.
3627440	3629400	Hey, you know what I love about our podcast
3629400	3631840	and what I don't understand about fucking NPR?
3631840	3633160	Oh no.
3633160	3635320	Is the, is there liberal nonsense?
3637000	3640400	No, they obviously have gone for a certain fidelity
3640400	3644240	in their mics that picks up every bit of moisture
3644240	3649240	in your mouth or lack thereof and everybody is just like,
3651040	3653280	it's so hard to listen to sometimes.
3653280	3654280	It's me hard to listen to.
3654280	3656600	Yeah, I get hard listening to it sometimes.
3657480	3661160	That's why NPR stands for National Boner Radio.
3663480	3664320	What?
3665440	3666280	NPR.
3667280	3669320	NPR, National Boner Radio,
3669320	3670920	that would be a good shock shock.
3671920	3676920	You're listening to NPR with penis in the clit.
3681880	3682720	I'm the clit.
3682720	3683720	I'm the clit.
3688800	3691160	All right, Vivica, let's edit this thing.
3691160	3693200	We've got a long night ahead of us.
3693200	3694040	I bet.
3694040	3694880	I'll be right back.
3694880	3695880	Would you all like some coffee?
3695880	3696720	Yes.
3696720	3698440	Cal, you follow, like the camera follows Cal
3698440	3699640	to the little office kitchen
3699720	3701280	and he makes everybody some coffee.
3701280	3703960	He knows how many creams Beck takes or doesn't.
3703960	3706000	He grabs a handful of creamers and sugar
3706000	3707520	for everybody else who he doesn't know
3707520	3709160	and he stops by his office
3709160	3712720	and he pours a hefty belt of whiskey into his.
3712720	3715520	In the editing bay, Beck cracks his knuckles
3715520	3718440	and he says, okay, first it's like a,
3718440	3719680	there's a jackalip that I fall on.
3719680	3721600	You can, there's footage of that
3721600	3723080	at four minutes and three seconds.
3723080	3724240	And then there's also the time
3724240	3726040	when the god turtle fell off the stool
3726040	3728080	and that's at seven minutes and eight seconds.
3728080	3730000	Oh, and there's also the machine that heals people.
3730000	3731640	That's at three minutes and five seconds in
3731640	3733080	and he's running down the list.
3733080	3734600	Julius is looking at his notes
3734600	3737120	and it's just Z a bunch of times
3737120	3738880	that he's like, he puts his phone down
3738880	3741080	and he's just like helping rattle off
3741080	3742520	other things that happened.
3742520	3744640	The children who look like animals
3744640	3746240	but are also humans, that's it.
3747280	3748280	Go ahead and roll.
3749360	3750800	Did she crit fail a grip roll?
3750800	3751640	Yep.
3751640	3752460	We're fucking dumb.
3752460	3753640	We should have kicked her out.
3753640	3755920	That's an 88 on the grip roll.
3755920	3756960	God.
3756960	3757880	Vivica, are you with me?
3758520	3763040	You see Vivica just staring blankly at the monitors.
3763040	3764800	We may have made a mistake
3764800	3766720	onboarding Vivica to this project.
3766720	3770440	I kind of forgot that this stuff is psyche damaging.
3770440	3772320	Welcome to Godal's gorge.
3772320	3773280	Yeah, Vivica.
3774160	3775720	Welcome to Godal's gorge.
3775720	3780720	["My life is great and it's all my fault"]
3805720	3810720	["My life is great and it's all my fault"]
