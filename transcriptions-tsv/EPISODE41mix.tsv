0	7040	Hello my loyal listeners, it's your radiotherapist wolf the dog and I'm here to dole out suspect
7040	11880	advice to people I barely know anything about and soothe your worries when it concerns the
11880	15960	goings on and contention and the world.
15960	20640	Or uh making them worse sometimes, hell I don't know what I'm doing here but y'all keep
20640	21800	listening.
21800	29940	As always we are broadcasting from 694.2 PTBP, the only place your worried minds can go to
29940	37300	be soothed when the galaxy is trying to swallow y'all up.
37300	43140	Anyway this week's howlin with wolf comes from at 1983bit who tweeted about the show
43140	45980	and tagged at pretending pod.
45980	51060	Spreading the news about this show is the only thing that will keep it on the air y'all.
51060	54820	Plus it makes my heart full of kissy kissy feelings.
54820	56060	They right.
56060	60660	Did the outstanding officers of contention notice the signs at the town's border that
60660	65280	said it was twinned with a small town in England called Uddersfield?
65280	69840	This is a message from Wolf's British cousin who has heard the news of the strange goings
69840	70840	on.
70840	76500	Uddersfield is safe y'all apart from the influx of top grade cocaine courtesy of the local
76500	81380	church which is floodin the cobbled streets of this west Yorkshire town.
81380	84820	Don't forget to send us a postcard from Contention Wolf.
84820	86980	We await your next update.
86980	90140	Tom from Uddersfield UK.
90140	92700	Now listen here Tom the dog.
92700	96180	I told you to never ride into the show.
96180	101300	I told you what I'd do to you if I ever caught a whiff of you scurrying about.
101300	105740	I'd throw your soul into a dimension from which you'd never return.
105740	111140	You'd drift on slowly grasping at everything but touching nothing while you fade from
111140	114380	existence over millennia.
114380	119020	But nice to know things are good in jolly old London Thomas from Uddersby.
119020	121000	Speaking of jolly times.
121000	125860	If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl tag at pretending pod on Instagram
125860	131060	or Twitter tag pretending to be people on Facebook or write a 5 star review and email
131060	134600	us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.
134600	139500	Also don't sleep on the contest happening over on the subreddit r slash pretending to
139500	140900	be people.
140900	146280	You could win your very own hardback slipcase set of Delta Green the Role Playing Game.
146280	151320	So join up with the community there and get to stepping on that contest y'all.
151320	156140	Sometimes when I hear about the horrors of the world I feel like stepping into a different
156140	157140	reality.
157140	159220	It's the news.
159220	164260	Last time Francis Beans embedded a big ol' rusty fish hook into John Lee Pettymore's
164260	166780	shoulder before Clark Bishop could step in.
166780	171620	Clark gave her a boot to the gut and she fell into the massive aquarium hitting her head
171620	176860	on the catwalk on the way down and they left her to float face down in the murky water
176860	180220	for pretty much the entirety of the episode.
180220	185020	Meanwhile Keith Vigna escaped from the creature that swallowed him and George Piston.
185020	191640	He pulled it off by firing his small but powerful pistol into the wall of this beast planting
191640	197080	a frag grenade into the newly made enclave and using George Piston as a shield from the
197080	198080	blast.
198080	203280	Keith hit the surface laughing and gibbering some nonsense about something being inside
203280	204280	him.
204280	209080	They tried to let Kathy Piston off the hook from which she hanged but they fucked up and
209080	211320	dropped her to the bottom of the tank.
211320	216960	John Lee Pettymore jumped in, rolled luckily and paddled Kathy Piston back into the presuming
216960	219040	safety of the catwalk.
219040	225560	Keith performed CPR on both Francis and Kathy but wouldn't you know it only Kathy survived.
225560	231000	After releasing Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad from his arm shredding fish
231000	236600	hook our three protagonists and their two new companions stand together ready to take
236600	242720	on the evil of Marvin Glass and foil his plans to take over the hometown of contention.
242720	248240	But first I've set aside just enough time to prepare a brand new song.
248240	253920	It may take some time to get used to like Bitter Coffee and Step-Parents but it's what
253920	259660	the American masses want inside of them like Bitter Coffee and Step-Parents.
259660	264560	It's kudzu with no backbone.
278240	293920	Let's start the episode now.
293920	296200	Zach later.
296200	297200	Start it here.
297200	298200	Pop pop pop!
298200	299200	Oh god.
299200	300200	Now you can see.
300200	301200	Yeah.
301200	302200	It's visual.
302200	306240	There was a guy on Reddit today that asked if you treated- fuck.
306240	307240	I think it was-
308240	311920	I think his example was IMDB scores and Rotten Tomatoes but I just used Rotten Tomatoes but
311920	316440	it was if you treated directors scores as a batting average that if you took all their
316440	321040	scores and averaged them out and I got really curious so I did a bunch of them and it was
321040	322040	really interesting.
322040	323040	Nice.
323040	324040	Who had the best?
324040	329400	So obviously because it's averages like Kubrick was way up there because he only has like
329400	333580	six films and they're all a hundred basically.
334060	338100	The ones I thought were interesting Ingmar Bergman and Martin Scorsese both have like
338100	343260	80% averages and they've both got like 35 films each.
343260	344260	They've got a huge list.
344260	346860	I was gonna say Scorsese would probably be up there.
346860	347860	Their status is way up there.
347860	349300	The one I was surprised was low.
349300	350300	What was it?
350300	353260	I think it was Fincher maybe had a really low score.
353260	355620	I wonder who the worst is.
355620	358540	I did M. Night Shyamalan just to see and it was 49.
358540	361660	It was really low compared to the others.
361660	365460	He's had some bangers in some really really truly awful movies.
365460	368940	Still batting 490 so.
368940	372140	If he was a baseball player he'd be in the Hall of Fame.
372140	383780	So as a GM and as a goon as I traditionally call myself or dumb as some have been known
383780	391620	to say I have an interesting time with how we end a session or an episode in some of
391620	398660	these cases do I do a cliffhanger is fun often or do I give you guys something right
398660	403620	off the bat the next time that you're not prepared for you just always wait for somebody
403620	411020	to say something dumb or funny and then I start screaming shut up it's over stop playing
411020	419660	the fun game and then we have to stop talking to each other you won't take this seriously
419660	425580	so let's go ahead and kick it off let's see where we're at I think you guys were on the
425580	432660	catwalks walking up to we had getting down we had just got a trench head Trent Chad Doug
432660	438240	Jacobs Chad yeah we just got him down and did we do anything else where was that pretty
438240	442340	much this I'm pretty sure that's where we ended I think that's about where it ended
442340	449180	you did you did some sort of a cheerful gathering the group together speech we all high-fived
449420	455740	freeze-frame high-five Francis Dunn at this point right or is she very dead very dead
455740	461900	and that's what I thought very dead Francis is bacon so you guys are standing on this catwalk
461900	468540	with Doug Jacobs in the body of agent Trent Chad who's trying to recover from everything that's
468540	473860	happened to him and Kathy piston who you've been having some interesting conversations with will
473860	479060	you remind me how much time has passed since the last time we saw Doug Chad the last time you saw
479060	484020	him would have been in the cage but I mean in mortal time did we put has a day passed or two
484020	491060	I think about a day okay though you've all been unconscious remember in the last 24 hours when
491060	500500	we died no not really it seems like weeks ago so you guys are all standing there and the there's
500500	507820	the catwalk that leads away from the torture chamber or prison or whatever weird aquarium
507820	514220	topping that you are currently standing in and on the other side away from that is the elevator
514220	519620	door and I need you all to roll alertness for me as you begin walking toward the elevator door
525180	535540	I pass an 18 on a 70 pass 54 on a 60 the eight nice yeah three successes so you guys all see
535660	542700	as you're walking down this catwalk busting up out of the water just to the right of you
542700	550700	is the fish man you saw earlier wearing the brown jumpsuit who is walking the perimeter in here and
550700	559380	he flops up onto the catwalk kind of like a fish out of out of water and begins to shake off and
559380	569300	we are going to enter combat cool enter combat now I've done something kind of fun maybe perhaps
569300	575020	interesting for this specific combat that we're in right now we all got to get ourselves drenched in
575020	581860	the bathtub this is very cool whoa I assume this will be posted on the Instagram it will indeed so
581860	586380	what I've done is I used a whiteboard to make a map of the room that you're in you'll see the
586380	592620	grid has the green where the water is and the white is the catwalk that you're standing on
592620	598380	remember catwalk is kind of great you know so you can still see and very much smell the water coming
598380	603980	out from underneath you that black X's are on a couple of the water spots those are where bodies
603980	610400	are hanging and over there there's a circle with a little frowny face and two X's that's where the
610400	616800	body of Francis beans is and then down here we have the catwalk leading to the elevator door we
616800	624280	also have five little little magnets three of which are cat butts the butts of cats I thought
624280	632400	they were dinosaurs they look extremely similar to brontosauruses and then we have two little
632400	638600	markers down here one is a kitty pen magnet thing and the other one's just a little brick so the
638600	644120	little brick is gonna be agent Trent Chad's body with Doug Jacobs trapped inside and the little
644120	651120	kitty there is going to be Kathy piston what color cats do you guys want to be we've got an orange
651120	656800	cat a gray cat and a black cat I want to be the orange cat I'll be the gray cat I got the black
656800	661760	cat then all righty is that elevator door the one we came in to get into this room it is indeed okay
661960	675000	so are we positioned correctly right now sure okay then we leave you got this Kathy so the elevator
675000	685520	door so this brown suit fish man flops in between you guys and the elevator door and stands up and
685520	693960	shakes all this water off of him and looks up at you and we are now in combat Joe Clark Bishop
693960	700520	always acts first what do you do I want to pull so I handed Kathy a gun last episode yeah I want
700520	705800	to pull the other one from my waistband and throw it to Doug Chad all right and if I can I'd like to
705800	711280	still pull mine out of my boot can I do two of those I would say that you could like pull one
711280	716080	throw it and then pull another but maybe not shoot this turn that's what I'll do if that works for
716080	723040	you and who's got a better dexterity between John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna I have 60 50
723040	729360	all right so Keith Vigna you are up next so real quick Doug Chad might not be able to catch too
729360	742440	well with his stigmata dance I didn't want to influence your role-playing decision but I'll
742440	748360	roll for him let's see if he'll have a 40% chance to catch it that's not bad given where the cat
748360	754720	butts are I could just grapevine it down to him he rolled a 31 yeah so that's our Doug Chad he
754720	764280	grimaces and is like alright ready to go and then he loads he like cocks the pistol so you can tell
764280	771080	he means business and it is Keith Vigna's turn I pull out my tiny powerful gun aim it right at
771080	780160	that fish man and take a shot all righty go ahead and roll firearms for me 74 and a 70 oh so you
780200	786880	fire into the wall and it actually makes a divot in this so the wall right next to the elevator is
786880	792600	that same like onyx kind of like black obsidian and you fire into it and it actually like kind of
792600	797880	cracks and you can see in the reflection it like shatters into a bunch of different like mirror
797880	805080	reflections all coming back and it looks very cool awesome miss thanks John Lee Pettymore it's
805080	811000	your turn I want to sling my shotgun like down to my hip and pull my pistol out with my other hand
811000	817120	and give them a blast with each with each yeah dual wielding yes all right I'm gonna have you
817120	829800	roll firearms at negative 20% oh man hopefully this was a good call yes 25 on a modified 60 so
829800	835240	40 congratulations all right so you are almost point-blank range so you're gonna be in your
835240	841080	second damage increment on the shotgun so you're gonna roll 3d6 for damage on that on just the
841080	848720	shotgun yeah and then also it was a pistol you said the heavy pistol in yep so 1d 10 3d 6 plus
848720	861320	two hell yeah good shot oh no okay so eight plus so 10 10 total all right so that blast goes
861320	868880	directly into his gut and have you ever was aiming for his guilt has he ever gutted a fish
868880	876680	before yeah what's it look like on the inside fish guts yeah so it's that you blast through
876680	881640	and you can tell especially since it's his turn next you'll be able to tell that he's gonna be
881640	889800	able to continue to act but according to what one might call I think it's D&D is it Dungeons
889800	904040	and Dragons rules he is certainly bloodied immediately he's oh wow for talking ooh ooh for
904040	911720	talking talking talking for talking ooh ooh for talking talking talking yeah that's
911720	940080	talking talking talking you hear that all happen in quartet fashion as three other fish men show
940080	945400	up on the map and I will place them they're going to be on either side of you and in the
945400	952200	back of the room by Francis beans body they're flanking us there was another cat but available
952200	958960	and you saved it for a fish man there was what are those cats called it's got a black tail it's
958960	965080	like the one in meet the parents like Siamese sure and so with that these other you hear a
965080	972400	full quartet and surround sound of this chance oh by the way he has a smile while he's singing
972400	978040	more of a grimace than a smile I suppose more of a giant purple action figure for McDonald's and
978040	986840	he his teeth are like human teeth I don't know if I've ever explained that when he when he grimaces
986840	993000	these uh these mutated humans they still have it's like those fish clown fish they're not
993000	1000800	fish I think I looked it up once and they've got real weird human looking teeth yeah and
1000800	1008880	this creatures in front of you also has those teeth with that his turn is finished and Doug
1008880	1013760	Jacobs Oh Kathy piston are both standing there with pistols in their hands well hey can we get
1013760	1021360	back to the magnet thing real quick Doug was a cat okay okay you're absolutely right I fucked up
1021360	1027720	really bad here so we're gonna take away the just swap them the brick the brick is now fish man
1027720	1035000	the brick is now a fish man and Doug Jacobs is rightfully a cat but it's called a sheep's head
1035000	1043360	fish oh I hate that yeah it's really gross like it what I'm imagining it's bad in my mind space
1043360	1052960	bad oh freaking out they are they're both gonna fire in two two different directions here Kathy
1052960	1058800	is gonna shoot the one who is flanking you from the back and side and Doug Jacobs is gonna fire
1058800	1065240	at the one right in front of him Doug Jacobs misses wildly and fires into one of the shattered
1065240	1072040	pieces of wall that Keith fired into earlier breaking it further into a prettier site oh and
1072040	1081000	Kathy piston fires true and does five damage to one of the fish men the one on the bottom the one
1081000	1089800	on the bottom nice good job Kathy Kathy piston fires straight and true she let loose a bullet
1089800	1097720	she slayed the fish man she shot gun real good fireball variable the other three fish men
1097720	1109040	continued in their their chanting and you hear a rumble and your feet begin to shake and you see
1109040	1120200	in the distance two massive claws grab on to the catwalk and begin ripping it down and the catwalk
1120200	1129720	fully breaks off into the water and where it once was you see this massive creature that looks
1129720	1138040	exactly like one of these fish men unclothed and four times larger and this one has a giant wound
1138040	1146880	in its side and it is bleeding out pus water and this black ichor what's the junk like oh it's
1146880	1154200	super tight that will be portrayed by this magnet for tank seven by Boulevard Brewing
1154200	1162680	smokestack series cool cool yeah making me thirsty and with that the giant monster fish
1162680	1167760	creatures in the game at the top of the order here it's gonna be Clark Bishop's turn and I
1167760	1174840	want to give you guys a few outlines for this combat basically in order to leave this room
1174960	1179240	from what you know right now you have to leave through the elevator in order for the elevator
1179240	1183880	to come you have to press the button you don't know how many rounds it's gonna take for the
1183880	1190600	elevator to come after you press the button so you have to survive until the elevator comes you
1190600	1203960	can each move you make an elevator come carefully you can each move two spaces which I'm gonna
1203960	1210640	dictate as grid spots so you can move from like one water to the you know move up different water
1210640	1216760	spaces in the grid or no sorry you can move one space and act or you can move two spaces with no
1216760	1221400	how many spaces away is the button for the elevator the button for the elevator is going
1221400	1226340	to be two spaces away from where you all are now okay like the elevator bridge represents two
1226340	1230360	squares basically sure yeah yeah yeah cool all right Clark Bishop top of the round what do you
1230360	1236520	want to do I'm going to fire at the fish man that is blocking our way to the elevator all right go
1236520	1248040	ahead and roll firearms for me yeah I pass a 24 on an 80 already rolled damage that's a four four
1248040	1255960	on one d10 do you say anything cool does he die oh yeah fuck so you you firing into him with your
1255960	1270080	pistol I got him hook line and sinker it's made all the cooler as the fish man stumbles back and
1270080	1280320	forth as being shot and looks at you and goes dogging and then falls off to the left side into
1280320	1286840	the water and you see blood start to dissipate all throughout the water he would have been a
1286840	1294120	really chill dude if he was like hook line and sinker barely knew her and then died that would
1294120	1300320	have been very chill you're a chill way to respond to somebody like action movie line yeah is Delta
1300320	1305320	green a game where if I've now used an action I can't move or can I go ahead and use the movement
1305320	1315960	I would have had game Joe is this okay it's a life it's a lifestyle in which you can move one
1315960	1321200	space after you fire yeah I'd like to go ahead and make my way middle of the gang weather making my
1321200	1328640	way the middle Clark Bishop is now in the middle on his way to the elevator one space away Keith
1328640	1334360	Vigna it's your turn hey do I have a clear shot on big boy you do he's pretty far away pretty
1334360	1341240	right now about 50 yards out I'll take one step or one square towards them and then take a shot
1341240	1346400	with my tiny powerful gun yeah do you do anything cool or do you just like walk slowly toward it or
1346400	1351880	do you tremble or are you scared at all this giant fucking beast that's in front of you I fought this
1351880	1358520	motherfucker already you fucking took this as I fire at him I say eat this noodle fish bitch
1358520	1377040	all right okay roll okay 93 wow you cannot roll a success to save your life sucks you just fire
1377040	1384520	this this gun I mean it the noise that it makes in this room every time you fire it is exhausting
1384520	1393760	to the ears as is your lack of good rolling strongly petty more stern can I make it to the
1393760	1398760	elevator this turn you absolutely can okay I want to do that and press the button now already pardon
1398760	1409040	me you press the button to the left of the elevator door and it lights up green a few more
1409040	1417520	times John Kathy piston is going to in full Keanu Reeves fashion just start walking slowly and
1417520	1427240	calmly to the fish man she already shot and continue firing into it succeeding once again
1427240	1437760	yeah awesome and compliant NPC oh but she she does fire true however she only wings them in
1437760	1443720	the shoulder and it does not seem to do any damage whatsoever which is interesting if you
1443720	1449720	had to put a numerical value on it I would say zero it seems like these fish men have some sort
1449720	1458720	of armor on their skin that is making them not take full damage from gunfire interesting like
1458720	1467040	an amphibious chainmail like an amphibious chainmail Doug Jacobs is going to join you on
1467120	1472400	the catwalk he's very scared he wants to get out of here he's tired his arms hurt and he's bleeding
1472400	1478440	all over the place he's very upset and for the last like couple hours he's just been doing
1478440	1488200	everything everyone says and he hated feeling that way and he's scared if it gets real bad we
1488200	1494400	just throw this bleeding bastard to the big fish like chum right I'm saying no of course not but
1494400	1503680	I'm nodding yes these fish men both jump in the water ooh sneaky habits is bloop bloop and then
1503680	1512520	they pop out on either side of Keith Vigna they got some movement on them the massive lumbering
1512520	1520440	creature is clawing its way right toward Keith Vigna who is now being completely surrounded by
1520440	1529720	these amphibious creatures oh that's close and it gets close enough in one turn to go ahead and
1529720	1545680	try to claw at Keith Vigna succeeding so so Luke if you die before we play the next game do you
1545680	1557200	want to just uber home instead of the claw does nine damage so claw basically one of the like
1557200	1566320	claw just reach it like goes directly into your shoulder and the back four claws all dig into
1566480	1576200	your back and it is going to with a successful claw attack it has a chance to grab and it fails
1576200	1582320	the group the grab so it digs its claws into you for nine damage and you start bleeding just
1582320	1589080	profusely and you actually feel a crunch where it entered you because it went all the way through
1589080	1598640	the layer of metal that is in that arm gosh well fuck I have two hit points left not to say we're
1598640	1604360	fucked oh you have two hit points left and so you took nine damage when you had 11 so I'm gonna go
1604360	1610880	ahead with two hit points you might fall unconscious why did I say that so oh because we're playing a
1610880	1618600	game fun when we when we play by the oh we shouldn't be shakes your consequences everything
1618600	1625280	she always work out so I need you to roll a constitution check to stay awake as blood just
1625280	1634200	gushes 93 with different dice yeah that is absolutely remarkable as Keith Emmett light
1634200	1642600	goes out and he falls on to the catwalk Luke I'm gonna need you to leave the room yeah I figured
1642600	1650800	oh shit we'll save you Keith I hope so I've actually got a pretty decent plan I think
1664200	1692080	the only one
1692080	1694960	try
