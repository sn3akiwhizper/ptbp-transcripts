0	3340	What is boiling, my dumplings?
3340	6900	It's your chef de cuisine, Wolf the dog.
6900	10480	And I am pinching dough like a mad dog
10480	15300	so I can provide sustenance to all my glorious fans.
15300	20100	Hope y'all like that boiled dough with some mayonnaise inside.
20100	25100	And I am cooking it up live from 694.2 PTBP,
25140	30140	the only radio station to win a Michelin star by force.
30460	34920	This episode's Howlin' with Wolf is from at Sis Fordman
34920	37520	from Maryland, who tweeted about the show
37520	39420	and tagged that pretending pod,
39420	43020	the sixth best thing you can do with your fingers.
43020	46780	They write, the network has been compromised,
46780	49180	root access granted.
49180	53580	The reality we know or knew is DDoSed
53580	55780	and held by dark matter.
55780	59300	All bow, the new pseudo is here.
59300	62420	This exploit is sticking around.
62420	65420	Patch Tuesday, kernel panic.
65420	69460	Your disk is spinning fast and you can't dump the RAM.
69460	71780	Unplug yourself and pray.
71780	75040	Silas Cole is here to fuck up your day.
76020	79780	Sis admin, what the fuck did you just make me read?
79780	81460	If this is about computers again,
81460	84300	I'm going to be so fucking pissed off.
84300	86340	Remember, if you want to write up something
86340	89160	for your cream filled doughy wolf to how,
89160	91700	tag at pretending pod on the internet
91700	96300	or write a five star review on Apple podcasts, please.
96300	99240	If you're one of the blessed angels or demons
99240	102420	who make a post, forget the om,
102420	106600	I just want to say T Hanks, thanks.
106600	111600	I don't want to be cast away in a green mile of thick woods
111640	115200	solely-ing the forest with my gump.
115200	117140	I want to be big.
117140	120120	Now onto the next thing I do.
120120	124640	It's time for the news of the world.
124640	128300	Last time, Don D. Pettymore was confronted
128300	132160	with the fact that his nephew is a non-human being
132160	135480	that currently resides inside its own daddy,
135480	136920	Don's brother.
136920	140000	This was after John, as always, forgot
140000	144640	that not everyone already understands his current condition.
144640	146960	Jack explained, he was searching
146960	149060	for the door out of this place.
149060	151600	Keith promised Leo they'd come back for him
151600	154920	to take him away from this existence.
154920	159040	Don admitted he came to this plane through his Nike bag,
159040	162140	the same one he used as Agent Victor
162140	165680	to dispose of an unnatural rotary phone
165680	169460	that supposedly healed anyone of anything.
169460	172560	John gained a new understanding of his abilities
172560	175640	in this setting, and he dissipated an opening
175640	177480	into the wall of this junk room
177480	180680	where Keith claimed a rope bridge connected
180680	183960	and led to a second stilted bunker.
183960	187440	The group decided to call the number of the rotary phone,
187440	189800	and they heard a ring from across the oily,
189800	193880	colorful bridge inside this duplicate fort.
193880	196760	The entire party witnessed a dreadful sight
196760	200360	as Keith, Don, and Jack all walked out
200360	202920	onto the Bridge of Spies.
202920	206640	Boom, another Tom Hanks reference at the buzzer.
206640	208120	Now listen here.
208120	211360	No, closer, closer.
211360	216360	Get incredibly close so this one is extremely loud.
216600	219840	This track is in a league of its own.
219840	224040	It's Dragon in Three with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?
224040	229040	["What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?" by Dragon in Three plays in the background.]
229840	233960	Bad girls on top of the water
233960	238160	Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline
238160	242240	Leaving my mind at your altar
242240	245900	Crossing the double line, doing it every time
245900	250900	Tell me what kind of world are you livin' in?
254700	259700	What kind of world are you livin' in?
263060	266900	Hello, everybody out there pretending to be listening.
266900	268580	We're pretending to be people,
268580	273580	and you are getting ready for another crazy episode.
274580	279060	My name is Zach, and I am your handler,
279060	281220	not your best friend, not your dad,
281220	285980	not your Dungeon Master, just giving you the handler,
285980	289860	handler, hand, handy, giving you, handle, hand,
289860	293740	I'm the hand, I'm here with my second, third, fourth,
293740	298740	and 17th best friends, and how are you guys doing?
300260	301540	Am I 17?
302500	303900	If you have to ask.
310900	312620	I'm doing okay, how are you doing, Zach?
312620	314980	Yeah, I'm doing pretty good.
314980	316140	I'm really sad.
316140	316980	Oh, no.
316980	318700	I was trying to cover it up
318700	322820	by really being over-hyped in the intro, but...
322820	325620	Bud, what's got you down?
325620	327620	My butt turned green.
327620	328460	Oh!
328460	329980	Your butt turned green?
329980	330820	You hate to hear it.
330980	332020	Yeah, the whole thing.
332020	332980	Is it mad?
332980	334100	It's jealous.
337020	338700	My ass is green with envy.
338700	341380	Who's it jealous of, or what is it jealous of?
343220	344060	Apples.
344060	346460	How many apples could you fit in there?
347980	349780	Inside or just within the cheeks?
349780	353660	Because I think just within the cheeks I could get two,
353660	356380	but I don't think any are going in my actual asshole.
356380	358260	Oh, standing up for sure, I mean.
358260	359860	Yeah, wow.
359860	361260	I don't think I could get any
361260	363540	unless I could use the stem,
363540	364980	and the stem was nice and long.
368420	371500	Like an apple tree branch filled with mini apples.
371500	374740	You could just drag them along like a dog.
375780	379100	Can I bite the apple into a shape
379100	381660	that might be more fitting?
381660	384380	As long as you put the whole thing in you,
384380	385380	you can slice it up.
385380	386220	Okay.
387340	388260	Okay.
388260	389100	Do I get to eat it after-
389740	393820	Any part you slice off does have to go up there.
393820	395780	Yeah, the whole thing has to.
397900	399660	You guys know when you're eating an apple
399660	402660	and you bite down where the skin meets the flesh,
402660	406100	like the inside, and the skin just goes right up
406100	407220	in between your teeth?
407220	409060	That's awful.
409060	409900	No.
409900	412300	Yeah, try not to think about that
412300	414740	with your butt instead of your mouth, huh?
414740	416460	But your butt doesn't have teeth, though.
416460	418220	I'm doing this new thing where I say, huh?
418260	419900	I like that new thing you're doing, Zach.
419900	420740	Huh?
420740	422060	Your butt doesn't have teeth.
423020	425020	This is a good introduction to the podcast.
425020	426860	Again, right up on that microphone.
427860	430060	Thomas, I can't hear your sadness
430060	433180	if you don't get up on that.
433180	436180	I'm sad about the way you chose to start the podcast.
439900	442060	Do you have a better, do you have an idea?
444220	445940	Yeah, it could just be our normal bullshit,
445940	450100	but maybe you don't talk about shoving apples up your ass.
450100	450940	I don't know.
450940	453060	I didn't start that.
453060	456100	Yeah, it all happened so quick,
456100	457500	no one knows who started it.
462420	466260	Isn't talking about shoving apples up our assholes
466260	469580	exactly what our normal intros are like?
469580	471540	We've probably already done this one.
472940	474420	Okay, what do you want to talk about
474420	475660	putting up our buttholes?
476540	478060	Well, I don't know if you guys have heard
478060	479660	about the fuck barrel, but.
481060	484460	Save it for the den of sin, baby, save it.
484460	487460	Patreon people know what the fuck barrel is all about.
487460	488300	Yeah, they do.
488300	491340	Are they gonna have early access to buy it
491340	493300	before the general public?
493300	495740	They're gonna have a lot of access.
495740	496660	Oh, hell yeah.
498260	500620	Ah, the bridge, I jump off the bridge.
500620	501780	Back to safety.
502620	506580	Ah, the bridge.
508380	509540	Take it to the bridge.
516580	521580	Like the last episode ended on a bit of a cliffhanger.
521740	526620	And so first I need stealth roles.
526620	529100	Yes, slight pun intended, I suppose.
529140	531780	I need stealth roles from Clark Bishop
531780	535220	and John Lee Kevinmore because they were trying
535220	540220	to avoid being seen by a pair of children,
541700	543900	the Littles, Aiden and Alice,
543900	548900	who they had one interaction with previously.
548940	553940	Yeah, we got them sucked up into this world through a vacuum.
555940	557740	Am I close enough to hear him say this?
557740	559980	No, this is his own internal narration
559980	564980	as he has reminded himself.
565300	569700	Yes, he's reminded himself as he expertly avoids
570540	573580	identification by these children with a 39 on a 50.
573580	574540	Oh, well done.
574540	578820	Unfortunately, Clark is like peeking his head out
578820	582340	and like, what, what are we trying to avoid being seen by?
583620	585940	Cause he rolled a 65 on a 30.
586900	588420	Hey, look, it's those kids.
590580	592540	Hey, look over there and he's pointing.
593980	598020	Aiden and Alice Little are looking back up at Clark Bishop,
598020	601620	who's hanging out, hanging out Beatles style
601620	603140	of this doorway.
603140	606060	And they both give you the,
606060	608980	who's the meet the Fokker's dad?
608980	610820	Robert De Niro.
610820	613540	Yeah, yeah, that's what I know him from best.
613540	616500	He's giving you the best, like Robert De Niro,
616500	619340	pointing two fingers at their eyes,
619340	622180	these little twin children eyes,
622180	624540	and then pointing those same two fingers
624540	626580	right up at Clark Bishop.
626580	629800	John Lee Pettymore still has Clark's compact
629800	632100	and he's like watching that over his shoulder.
633980	637460	And that, well, that's exactly, he just gives a big woo.
640180	641460	How old are the kids?
641460	642460	Oh, they're children.
642460	644600	Okay, that's as specific as you got.
645540	647700	Yeah, I don't think I ever said maybe like
647700	650940	anywhere between 10 and 12, so 11.
650940	651900	Sigh.
651900	655580	Damn, that's getting into like capable rascal territory.
657140	659660	I was picturing way more, like these are,
659660	664020	these might be like pretty crafty little bastards.
664020	666300	And I was kind of picturing like much younger children
666300	667700	that we could just kind of, you know,
667700	669660	push off the bridge or something, but.
670420	671260	Ah, 11's normal.
671260	673660	I'm really glad, I'm really glad they didn't see me.
673660	676000	They are standing on a boat.
676000	677940	Did you say they're both little?
677940	681540	That's funny, because their last name is Little.
681540	684420	So the boat that is made of this inky darkness
684420	686940	that's super colorful has been written on
686940	691620	with the shimmering silver sea seemingly.
692560	696580	There are shiny numbers all over the whole of the boat
696580	700980	and it is the numbers that spell overseer.
700980	704120	And the figurehead of the vessel is a young man
704120	708820	with curly black hair who Don seemingly recognized.
708820	710540	You could see it in his eyes.
710540	715540	And I mean, this dude is being melted continuously
716980	721140	about from the waist down as he's halfway in the water
721140	724800	and his mouth has been steeled shut as well.
724800	725800	And he's just like.
730600	735600	He's just crying and screaming out in endless pain.
736040	741040	And Julie Maxwell was wearing a hospital gown.
741360	744140	Couldn't help but notice when I said
744140	748480	that she had a massive gash running down her forehead,
748480	751560	Thomas was cackling a little bit.
752520	755320	Before you said running down her forehead,
755320	757280	there was a pretty big pause when you just said
757280	762120	she has a massive gash and it made me laugh.
762120	767120	Running down her forehead in between her eyes.
767720	772720	Her nose is missing and she smiles with no teeth
773220	776200	or lips on one full side of her face.
776200	779280	You think doo-doo her face being smashed.
779320	781320	Hey, Zach, you just said doo-doo.
782760	784920	Doo-doo her face smash.
784920	786760	I don't have to pile on that particular theme,
786760	788720	but what's this about her doo-doo gash?
789800	790960	Jesus Christ.
793080	796800	She is missing like half of her face
796800	801480	and that side that is missing the teeth and lips has an eye.
801480	802600	There's an eyeball there.
802600	803840	That part isn't missing,
803840	807600	but across her face on the other orbital socket,
808520	811400	if you're at home, don't Google orbital socket
811400	813440	or orbital socket oozing.
814280	817840	But this one is oozing with this dark substance
817840	819320	is pouring out.
819320	822320	Okay, so her head snaps forward
822320	826440	and a metal sphere climbs out
826440	831440	like a massive spidery tendrilly metal thing
831960	836960	just like pulls itself up out of the body of Julie Maxwell
837520	840800	and continues to hold that body
840800	842960	at the end of one of its tendrils
842960	846240	as one of the other ones lashes out
846240	851240	and rips at the bridge that Keith Bishop.
851520	852360	Nope.
854920	856200	You gave it away.
856200	857760	You gave away the big secret
857760	860040	we've been keeping this whole time.
860040	862480	We were all brothers, carnival brothers.
862480	863640	I'm my own grandpa.
867200	870160	In this world, all it takes to get married
870160	875160	is to share a microwaved meal on the same recliner.
875320	877400	So you guys are technically married.
877400	880320	Okay, so this thing just like it plants
880320	884760	some of its legs down into the boat
884760	888560	and then one of them rips out at this rope bridge
888560	892200	that's made out of this same dark and colorful material
892200	896120	and Keith beans and Jack Russell
896120	899800	and who is the third person who is out on that bridge?
899800	901720	Oh, that's right.
901720	904920	It's Don D fucking Pettymore.
904920	907440	The three of you are out on this bridge.
907440	912440	What are you doing as the metal tendril rips down
912920	915440	in between the three of you
915440	919960	and this stilted room that Clark Bishop
919960	923120	and John Lee Kevin Moore are inside?
923120	924680	How far away are we?
924680	929040	Okay, so the bridge is 10 yards
929040	930760	and you're about five yards into it.
930760	932920	You're like exactly halfway.
932920	935520	Also, give me your dexterity.
935520	937200	Mine is 55.
937200	938040	Same.
938040	938880	I got a 60.
938880	939800	60 as well.
939800	944800	Okay, so we'll do the order is Keith, Clark, Don, John.
947360	948200	Don John.
948200	949040	Don John.
949040	950080	Great movie.
950080	952360	Oh yeah, you love film?
953360	958320	Yeah, I guess you could say I'm a cinema enthusiast.
958320	960640	Don John is probably my favorite.
960640	961560	Just has a lot to say.
961560	962960	Not a lot of people get it.
962960	963960	Not a lot of people get it,
963960	966520	but it actually has a lot of really insightful things to say
966520	968920	kind of turns the whole gender thing on its head.
968920	969760	It's real subtle.
969760	972120	And Joseph Gordon-Levitt was the white man to do that.
972120	974640	Yeah, that was actually Joseph Gordon-Levitt
974640	977880	the whole time, which is crazy.
977880	979360	Oh wait, he was Don John?
979360	980720	Yes, the whole time.
980720	982840	Oh, cool.
984280	986840	See, like I said, you always find out new things
986840	987680	about that movie.
987680	990120	So if you consider yourself a film buff,
990120	991080	check out Don John.
991080	994320	All the stunts in the movie, he did for the most part.
994320	995160	That's crazy.
995160	997440	He actually cleaned an apartment as a man?
997440	998280	Yeah.
999240	1000520	He did not have a stunt double.
1000520	1001360	Wow.
1001360	1003960	Keith, you are in the middle of this rope ridge.
1003960	1008960	Five yards to your left is the second large stilted room
1009340	1010360	that you have not been to.
1010880	1013640	There's a hatch that is just right there, five yards away.
1013640	1016400	And five yards on your right, on the other side,
1016400	1019280	you see this John made hole
1019280	1021880	and you see John kind of hiding.
1021880	1022840	His back is turned.
1022840	1024400	He's looking through a compact
1024400	1026960	as Clark is hanging his head out
1026960	1031280	and kind of waving at some children who are on this boat.
1031280	1032480	What do you do?
1032480	1035200	Above 50, I jumped to the hatch.
1035200	1038640	Below 50, I jumped back to the John made hole.
1041080	1044520	87, I jumped to the hatch.
1044520	1046680	Okay, make a dexterity.
1046680	1048560	10 on a 60.
1048560	1049920	Well done, well done.
1049920	1051000	Okay, fantastic.
1051000	1054040	So you are running, running, running
1054040	1057480	as this bridge is falling out beneath you
1057480	1060760	and you are going to be able to make a leap
1060760	1064720	without falling to your likely demise.
1064720	1065560	Good thing you passed that rule.
1065560	1066400	Oh yeah, good thing.
1066400	1067440	Clark, what are you doing?
1067440	1068960	So the bridge is collapsing
1068960	1071280	from the point that I'm standing, right?
1071280	1072120	Correct.
1072120	1076840	Like the bridge part that is nearest you is going to fall.
1076840	1080600	You're not sure whether or not it will go into the water
1080600	1084440	but if I said earlier that the bridge is 10 yards long
1084440	1089440	and from one of the stilted hatch doors of the room
1090400	1094320	down to the shining, shimmering, shiver sea,
1094320	1097680	I think I said that was maybe 10 yards, 15 yards,
1097680	1099680	but it definitely wasn't less than 10 yards.
1099680	1102680	And so if you're like holding onto the rope bridge
1102680	1107440	then you'll probably be safe from falling into the not ocean.
1107440	1109400	But I'm not on the bridge itself though, right?
1109400	1110240	I'm still in this.
1110240	1111080	Certainly not.
1111080	1112560	No, I was just trying to give you an idea
1112560	1115000	of like what it looks like as it's happening.
1115000	1115840	So I don't, yeah.
1115840	1118160	I mean, I don't think I have an action here.
1118160	1120880	I want to stay on this side of the place
1120880	1123000	because I'm thinking about the boat
1123000	1125180	that is still docked on our side.
1125180	1126860	He's not going to like run out there.
1126860	1129780	I guess, oh, we're in a room filled with junk, right?
1129780	1131380	Yes.
1131380	1133120	I'll see if anything catches my eye
1133120	1134700	that could be helpful in this situation.
1134700	1136700	Maybe like bed sheets or something.
1136700	1137740	I don't know.
1137740	1138580	100%.
1142340	1146980	I rolled a 50 on a search and that's not good.
1146980	1148580	I've got a 20 in search.
1150260	1155260	Okay, so as you're looking through, you find pillowcases.
1156860	1161860	It's like bedsheets, but worse.
1161860	1164500	It's worse than what you were looking for.
1164500	1165340	These'll work.
1168400	1169980	Don D. Pettymore, you're up.
1169980	1173980	Don D. Pettymore is going to like scramble
1173980	1175380	because the one we were going to
1175380	1177980	is where the telephone was ringing, correct?
1177980	1178820	That is correct.
1178820	1182020	And that is where Keith is like sprinting towards
1182020	1185700	very like agilely running across this bridge
1185740	1187780	that is currently falling.
1187780	1190580	Yeah, I will also like scramble that way.
1190580	1193260	Okay, roll dexterity or athletics.
1193260	1195700	Oh, my athletic, nope.
1195700	1197100	Dexterity it is.
1200220	1201380	Oh my God.
1201380	1203980	I got a 54 out of 55.
1203980	1205540	Oh, oh shit.
1205540	1207620	Okay, fantastic.
1207620	1212340	So you are going to be able to make the jump as well.
1212340	1213820	At the beginning of your next turn,
1213820	1215620	you're going to be able to make that jump.
1216620	1219940	John, you see Clark digging through
1219940	1221700	and finding pillowcases.
1221700	1222660	What are you doing?
1223820	1227180	How close is the boat to us?
1227180	1229180	And specifically the John Mayhole?
1229180	1231500	Picture it like a triangle.
1231500	1235980	You are 10 yards away from the hatch that is across
1235980	1239760	and then you are 10 yards away from the boat
1239760	1242660	that is an equilateral triangle.
1242660	1245460	I see that everybody else who's out there on the bridge
1245460	1249300	is currently running to the other bunker, correct?
1249300	1250900	Yeah, Jack Russell hasn't gone yet.
1250900	1252100	So he hasn't moved
1252100	1255300	because that's how games work in real life too.
1255300	1258380	But the other two are certainly running away from you.
1258380	1261420	John, just I want to just start like closing
1261420	1262420	the John Mayhole.
1263540	1266540	Rad, oh shit.
1266540	1269020	Okay, roll unnatural.
1269980	1272820	39 on a?
1272820	1274460	More than that.
1274460	1275980	More than that.
1275980	1278740	One of these days you're going to fail that roll.
1278740	1280460	Oh, there I see it, 67.
1280460	1281460	Describe it.
1281460	1285760	He looks like he's frantically like trying to mop up a mess
1285760	1287260	with his hands.
1287260	1290440	He doesn't make like a good or like,
1290440	1292780	it doesn't look like a manmade solid wall
1292780	1294580	like it might have before.
1294580	1297340	You can actually see like his fingerprints and stuff
1297340	1302180	as he just like quickly goo-clayed it back into solid.
1302180	1305220	That's super cool, I can picture it.
1305220	1306980	And he leaves a tiny little peephole
1308580	1309940	so they can see what's going on.
1309940	1312740	Incredible, incredible.
1312740	1315620	Okay, so as you're looking through this tiny little peephole
1315620	1319520	you're probably the only one who sees Jack Russell.
1319520	1323860	I'm going to do the same roll that Luke did,
1323860	1325940	above 50 goes towards them,
1325940	1328940	under 50 tries to go back where he came from,
1328940	1330820	which is now closed.
1330820	1332000	I rolled a 94.
1332000	1335140	And so he's going to take off running
1335140	1339540	to follow Keith and Dawn, and he rolls a 10.
1339540	1343280	So Jack Russell is going to run along.
1343280	1345140	So the three of you, picture it like,
1345140	1348900	I'm picturing a Wes Anderson framing of this scene
1348900	1351700	because it's very flat, you know.
1351700	1354260	You've got this endless background behind you,
1354260	1357500	but then you have two identical stilted rooms
1357500	1359260	on either side of the frame,
1359260	1362620	10 yards above this silver sea
1362620	1365900	that just goes on endlessly into the background.
1365900	1368780	And then there's a bridge hanging in the middle.
1368780	1373140	Jack, Dawn, and Keith are sprinting to the right
1373140	1376660	as the bridge collapses from the left.
1376660	1380340	And as they run, the three of them kind of jump out.
1380340	1383100	And I'm picturing kind of a railing
1383100	1386100	going around the outside on this one maybe.
1386100	1390220	And so Keith is able to make the leap
1390220	1393500	and hopefully grab on.
1393500	1398500	So Keith, go ahead and roll as you see behind you,
1399900	1404900	this giant ball after it crashes down.
1405060	1406580	John, you can see this too
1406580	1409340	through your thimble sized hole.
1409340	1410180	Little smaller.
1411100	1413260	Oh, I got tiny thimbles, dude.
1413260	1414380	And so.
1415900	1417140	I just don't want your spider thing
1417140	1418540	poking one of its legs through it.
1418540	1420820	I'm trying to head off that eventuality.
1422300	1425460	You're not gonna tell me how big my hole was.
1426820	1428300	How many apples can fit through it.
1428300	1429660	And so you.
1430740	1432580	Can you chop them up?
1432580	1433420	We can talk about that.
1433420	1435180	I'm pretending to be people after dark.
1435860	1440860	These metal tendrils move into the shimmering sea.
1442980	1447980	They're planting themselves into this silvery ocean
1449500	1451860	and you hear a noise.
1451860	1456380	And you see these tendrils are all the same texture.
1456380	1459980	It's this shiny, shiny metal.
1459980	1461340	It's like the same texture,
1461340	1465620	but a solid of the ocean that is out there.
1465620	1467180	And you hear this like.
1476580	1480780	And you think that it is coming from the ball.
1480780	1483420	It is like reverberating this noise
1483420	1485540	through the world that you're in.
1485540	1489100	Does it sound like a person going re re re re re re re re
1489100	1491420	or is it actually like metallic sounds?
1491420	1494460	It is metallic sounding.
1494460	1499460	However, it does sound like the vocalizations of an entity.
1502940	1507140	Can you roll intelligence for me?
1507140	1508060	Can I roll on that?
1508980	1509820	Yeah.
1509820	1510660	Since I'm looking out the window.
1510660	1512780	I failed a 60 on a 55.
1512780	1516740	I passed a 54 on a 60 or 75.
1516740	1519340	John, as you're actually looking at this thing,
1519340	1522020	you're seeing it's like kind of stilted movements
1522020	1526900	of the ball as this noise is coming out of it seemingly.
1526900	1531900	Not only do you realize that even in ball form,
1531940	1536580	you would still be able to speak and vocalize
1536580	1538260	just like this thing is.
1538260	1540300	And it might sound like a little metallic,
1540300	1542660	but it would be your voice.
1542660	1547660	And this thing's voice sounds animalistic
1547780	1551140	and taking that idea one step further,
1551140	1556140	you think that this ball might've been inside an animal
1557060	1559500	for the past, who knows how long.
1559500	1560580	It's the raccoon.
1560580	1562660	And that's why it speaks like this.
1562660	1564300	Holy shit.
1564300	1565860	It's a feral ball.
1567020	1568740	Yeah, it's a rabid ball.
1569980	1570900	That's so dope.
1571900	1574780	Yeah, so John like looks back at Clark
1574780	1578180	who's frantically gathering pillowcases, I guess.
1578180	1580780	And he's like, quick update, door's closed.
1580780	1581900	We got a peephole.
1581900	1584100	That ball is some kind of feral ball.
1585300	1587980	So we probably don't need these pillowcases then.
1587980	1591220	I don't really know where I was going with that anyway.
1591220	1592140	And he drops it.
1592140	1593460	I mean, it can't hurt.
1595700	1596980	Oh, okay.
1596980	1598500	Gather some back up.
1598500	1600140	Find a Sharpie in here.
1600220	1601500	You could draw a little face on it.
1601500	1603980	And then that could be your mask from those kids.
1607180	1609820	You know, you give it like glasses and grumpy eyebrows
1609820	1612380	and a big beard, and then it won't look like Clark.
1612380	1613220	They're kids.
1613220	1614580	They wouldn't know.
1614580	1615420	Exactly.
1615420	1616500	They're stupid idiots.
1616500	1619300	Yeah, they're just a couple morons, you know?
1619300	1620140	So.
1621540	1623980	Keith, roll athletics or dexterity
1623980	1627220	in order to reach out and grab.
1627220	1628060	93.
1628180	1629020	Ooh.
1629980	1631300	On what though?
1631300	1632340	A 60.
1632340	1633180	Oh.
1635740	1636580	On a hundred.
1636580	1638300	Good thing I have a hundred decks.
1639820	1641460	You know how jacked Keith is.
1641460	1642620	You know, yeah, you know how Keith
1642620	1644740	was always darting off to the Olympics.
1647260	1649300	Every four years, he was really busy.
1649300	1650420	I know this isn't the rules,
1650420	1651900	but can I do a saving throw?
1654180	1655180	Fuck yeah.
1656180	1657460	Uh, no.
1657460	1659460	So you fall.
1659460	1660380	He could spend luck.
1660380	1661460	Oh.
1661460	1662300	I don't.
1662300	1663780	Ooh, well, how much luck do I have?
1663780	1665580	That would be a lot of luck, huh?
1665580	1666420	Is it?
1666420	1667260	It's not luck.
1667260	1669340	Luck doesn't start over with the new sheet, does it?
1669340	1670180	Ha!
1672180	1673460	Okay, you begin falling.
1673460	1674300	Do you want to describe it?
1674300	1676740	Yeah, I am running along the bridge
1676740	1679340	and then obviously start to lose footing.
1679340	1683220	And I like jump and I smack my arms
1683220	1685380	on where like the railing is.
1685380	1686340	This room is hot.
1686340	1688100	This area is pretty hot, right?
1688100	1688940	Cause of the melted ocean.
1688940	1690700	We've not talked about the temperature.
1690700	1693340	Well, how would you describe the temperature in this room?
1693340	1697060	It is exactly room temperature.
1697060	1699460	Oh, well I'm just sweaty cause I'm nervous
1699460	1702180	and my hands hit the bars.
1702180	1704660	I grab on just for a second,
1704660	1707860	like try to pull myself up and then slip off
1708980	1710300	and start falling.
1710300	1713340	So John looking through the peephole
1713340	1714700	relays that back to Clark.
1714700	1717460	He's like, Clark, you know how every time you go
1717460	1720180	to shake Vigna's hands, they're a little bit sweaty?
1720180	1721260	Right, yeah, of course.
1721260	1722860	Well, that just got the best of him.
1722860	1724460	We might have to open this hole back up.
1724460	1726020	He slipped off the bridge there.
1726020	1728180	Is he in the molten?
1728180	1729620	Is he in the sea?
1729620	1730440	Is he gone?
1730440	1733980	He's slowly falling towards it as you guys are talking.
1733980	1736540	It seems like he's almost moving in slow motion.
1741180	1742940	We're just waiting for an action to be taken.
1742940	1745020	I'm never gonna like tell you to not talk,
1745020	1746420	you know, in character.
1746420	1749020	It's like, it's always what I want.
1749020	1751320	So I'm never gonna cut you off.
1751320	1753660	Just imagine that it's happening really fast
1753660	1756700	and everything else action wise, very slow.
1756700	1759500	So John, what's your theory about what's going on here?
1759500	1760340	Exactly.
1760340	1762740	I'm glad you asked that actually.
1762740	1765180	I've got no fucking clue, man.
1765180	1766900	I was gonna ask.
1766900	1768420	I will cut you off.
1768420	1769740	Clark Bishop, it's your turn.
1769740	1771380	What do you do?
1771380	1773000	I mean, I got nothing.
1773000	1774920	I mean, can I keep searching for a thing
1774920	1776100	that's 10 yards long?
1776100	1777380	I don't know how to save a guy
1777380	1780300	that's falling 10 yards away from me.
1780300	1785300	Hey, Joe, you probably don't know how to save someone
1785500	1786860	far away, huh?
1786860	1787820	Yeah.
1787820	1790100	Remember guys how I'm doing the huh thing?
1790100	1790940	Huh?
1790940	1793700	How to save a life.
1793700	1794860	Huh?
1794860	1795820	Huh?
1795820	1798580	So yeah, Keith is in the fray falling down
1798580	1803580	and Clark is looking through.
1803940	1807820	Man, you could really, I mean, a cable car would be able to.
1807820	1809020	Here's what I wanna do.
1809020	1811700	I wanna look for something big and flat
1811700	1813180	that might float down there
1813180	1816020	and I could try and throw it under Keith
1816020	1818320	to like stop his fall.
1820460	1824640	This is, I don't know, a multi-roll maneuver maybe.
1826500	1828260	Not one, it's an odd one.
1828260	1829180	No way.
1830020	1832260	It's an odd one.
1832260	1834180	The green dice or what I?
1834180	1835580	Fuck yes, dude.
1835580	1836800	Hell yes, dude.
1836800	1839140	Joe just always has one set of dice
1839140	1844140	sitting on an odd one so that he can squeeze the camera down.
1844300	1846720	I've been waiting for two years for this.
1849740	1850820	Fuck yes, dude.
1850820	1851700	Okay, cool.
1851700	1852740	Well, what do you find?
1852740	1855300	What's the perfect item?
1856020	1857760	An old door is what I came to mind.
1857760	1858860	I'm picturing Titanic.
1858860	1863540	I don't wanna throw this lifeboat of a door down there.
1863540	1866140	Fuck yeah, you find an old door.
1866140	1867900	It looks really light.
1867900	1869260	I hold it up and show John.
1869260	1871180	John, what you gonna do?
1871180	1873860	And I'm trying to motion that I'm wanting to throw it out.
1873860	1876540	If you start throwing it at the end of your turn,
1876540	1881180	I will, at the start of my turn, open up the door again
1881180	1884620	and hope to time it right so it just sails right on through.
1884620	1886460	John says that with his eyes
1886460	1889760	and so Clark begins throwing.
1891840	1895240	Thomas just looked into the camera with big eyes.
1899860	1901740	Man, this is such a cool idea.
1901740	1904060	It's a shame Keith's gonna fall right into the water
1904060	1905620	at the beginning of his next turn.
1905620	1908420	All right, so it is Dawn's turn.
1908420	1910300	Am I rolling to grab?
1910300	1912820	Yeah, yeah, or whatever you wanna do.
1913460	1917820	You see Keith ahead of you as slipping and falling.
1917820	1921760	Are you gonna just grab two-handed onto the railing?
1921760	1924260	Can I do a special maneuver right now?
1924260	1925660	I love it when you ask that.
1926780	1927620	I consent.
1927620	1931460	Don D. Pattymore seeing this Keith fella
1931460	1933180	falling in front of him,
1933180	1936240	I guess in slow motion as I'm also jumping.
1936240	1939020	Like I love thinking of, it's very anime of us
1939020	1941700	to have all of us thinking very complete sentences
1942220	1943980	and all this action's happening.
1944980	1949420	Having full conversations somehow in a two-second span.
1949420	1952720	He starts chanting to himself,
1952720	1957720	vis-a-girl, vis-a-girl, vis-a-girl,
1957780	1959220	over and over again.
1959220	1962840	Okay, go ahead and roll dexterity to grab on.
1962840	1963680	Oh my God.
1968060	1970780	You got a 24 on a 55.
1970780	1971860	Oh, hell yeah.
1971860	1975580	Do you wanna describe grabbing onto this railing, Justin?
1975580	1978300	Yeah, I just, well.
1978300	1979140	I fuckin' grab it.
1979140	1980740	Yeah, I fuckin' grab it, bro.
1984540	1986840	I do what Keith did except I succeed.
1990740	1993900	And I light a cigarette in my mouth while I'm doing it.
1995740	1996940	In slow motion.
1996940	1998020	Okay, rad.
1998020	1999560	Jon, roll a natural.
1999560	2003040	Jon compelled as if,
2003040	2006600	it's almost like he's sharing a will with Clark.
2006600	2008560	He just knows to go to the door
2008560	2011560	and he rolls a 64 on a 67.
2011560	2016560	And just in time, he slides his hand down the door
2018160	2020720	and, or down the wall,
2020720	2023220	and a door-sized slot just opens
2023220	2025400	right as the door goes flying through.
2025400	2026640	Oh my God.
2026640	2027480	Yes.
2027480	2028600	Fucking incredible.
2028640	2030080	I am not gonna lie,
2030080	2033440	I was very much looking forward to Clark
2033440	2035160	just throwing a door into the wall.
2035160	2036280	Yeah, exactly.
2038720	2040320	What'd you do that for, Clark?
2041320	2042400	No, this is great, this is great.
2042400	2045560	I'm glad you guys are succeeding, I guess.
2045560	2048960	That, I mean, yeah, you've never seen Jon's eyes so big
2048960	2052300	and he's just staring at Clark in disbelief.
2052300	2056360	As this door flies through this little door-sized slot
2056360	2061360	in the wall and begins making its way down to the water
2062240	2067240	under Keith Vigna, Jack Russell is going to roll a naught 7
2068280	2071680	and he grabs on directly next to,
2071680	2076680	it's like we get another shot of what just happened
2077360	2079440	of the three men running and jumping
2079440	2083560	where Keith goes, hits, falls, and immediately,
2083560	2085660	Don grabs, and then immediately,
2085660	2088080	Jack Russell grabs right next to Don
2088080	2091660	and so the two of them are hanging from this railing.
2091660	2094420	Jack Russell is just pulling himself up,
2094420	2097440	going, oh, this is fucking shit.
2097440	2099520	And he's trying to pull himself up
2099520	2103760	and Don is a chancy, chancy boy.
2103760	2107380	Below the ball, you see these two twins,
2107380	2111000	one with a bowl cut, the other one with a pig tail.
2111000	2112960	They're running overalls.
2113240	2117560	And each of them has a massive smile on their face
2117560	2122560	and they reach into their little pockets in their overalls
2123280	2125860	and they each pull out a lollipop.
2128940	2130720	I think I just pissed myself.
2130720	2132280	That was scary.
2138220	2139680	Can you imagine?
2139720	2144360	Behind the ball, it's tendrils finding support
2144360	2149360	in the silvery, shimmery sea,
2149480	2150680	making this weird like,
2154960	2159960	noise is going to fling some of the melting steel
2160300	2162020	with one of its tendrils.
2162020	2163840	It's going to splash.
2165240	2168920	And it rolled a 23, like Michael Jordan.
2169040	2171600	You'd never wanted to get in the pool with Michael,
2171600	2173560	all time greatest splasher.
2175120	2176920	He could do the thing where he puts his hands
2176920	2179400	and squeezes them and it shoots right at your face.
2179400	2181800	You know what I'm talking about?
2181800	2184440	I do, my dad did that shit all the time.
2184440	2187140	Michael Jordan was the Scottie Pippen of doing that.
2189920	2192880	The splash is timed perfectly.
2192880	2197320	And this door made out of this black texture,
2197320	2201200	this colorful black texture flying perfectly
2201200	2203600	through the air to save Keith Vigna
2203600	2208600	from falling into this metal gets completely engulfed.
2209080	2214080	This melting steel wraps itself around this door
2215240	2219680	and it is no longer the liquid that it was previously.
2219680	2224680	It is now a metal door and the metal door falls,
2225480	2230480	hits the ocean and begins sinking as Keith Vigna falls.
2235280	2240280	Keith, your feet hit first.
2241700	2243480	I was going to say, is there any way
2243480	2246000	that my cargo shorts could act as parachutes
2246000	2248160	in this crazy world we're in right now
2249320	2251880	to slow my fall just a little bit?
2252840	2255620	In this crazy messed up world we're in.
2256780	2258840	He can't tell if that's better than the fact
2258840	2260340	that he was about to kill you.
2262060	2264580	Let's take a vote, Joe, Thomas, Justin.
2264580	2267920	If the cargo shorts can become parachutes.
2267920	2271520	I'll close my eyes so that I don't know who voted for what.
2271520	2273280	Yeah, put a thumbs up.
2273280	2276520	Put a thumbs up if you think that Keith touches down
2276520	2281360	into the metal sea and put a thumbs down
2281720	2284360	if you think parachute shorts.
2284360	2285800	All right, it's been decided.
2288400	2289960	Keith, your feet touch first.
2289960	2290800	Okay.
2296920	2301920	The pain is unimaginable.
2302360	2305560	It is the hottest.
2305560	2309240	It's giving off no temperature change to the air around it
2309240	2314240	but as your toes dip in, you can't feel anything at all
2316440	2318360	and your mind goes completely numb
2318360	2321520	and there's just this piercing noise
2321520	2323880	going through the back of your head, just this.
2334040	2339040	The shock immediately changes as the rest of you
2339480	2344480	slowly, slowly, agonizingly melts into this ocean.
2346720	2351720	Up to your knees now, your shins are fully melting.
2351760	2354040	You don't even know what it would be like
2354040	2357440	inside of your shorts but you think your legs
2357440	2359800	might just not even exist anymore.
2359800	2363400	You're just becoming part of this ocean itself
2363400	2365560	and your stomach hurts.
2365560	2369680	Your mouth immediately has the taste of metal
2369680	2372160	inside of it, blood and metal
2372160	2375640	and you can smell butter.
2375640	2377320	Smells like butter?
2377320	2378680	That's weird.
2378680	2383680	What do you scream out as your torso begins?
2383880	2385840	Don, use the phone on me!
2389320	2390600	Fuck yeah.
2390600	2395600	And you will continue melting in on your next turn
2395840	2398280	and by the end of your next turn,
2398280	2403280	you will be fully submerged in the shimmering silver sea.
2405440	2407280	Clark Bishop, it's your turn.
2407280	2408680	Clark Bishop, come on down.
2408680	2410920	Everything going good out there?
2410920	2412800	Did he land on the door?
2412800	2415080	That was good timing with you opening up that.
2416360	2417200	We got him, right?
2417200	2420000	You know, mission accomplished.
2421000	2421840	Yeah.
2421840	2422680	High five me, man.
2422680	2425640	John, weekly high fives you.
2425640	2426480	Every week?
2428000	2429840	This is our weekly high five.
2429840	2433880	It may or may not be about what just happened with Keith,
2433880	2436440	which may or may not have been successful.
2437640	2441520	I may or may not have just seen one of the most
2441520	2444160	horrific things I could ever hope to imagine
2444160	2447520	as he may or may not have melted into the ocean.
2447520	2450000	And Keith is just screaming at the top of his lungs
2450040	2453440	until it gets to his lungs and then it's just gurgles.
2453440	2456280	Keith, everyone knows you're in over your head,
2456280	2457520	over your head.
2460880	2463440	See, he's so excited that he got caught by the door.
2463440	2464280	He's so excited.
2464280	2465640	He's screaming for joy, right?
2467080	2470280	Clark, at the end of the day, it was a great throw.
2470280	2473400	You did your bit as good as anyone could have asked you,
2473400	2475880	but unforeseen circumstances came up
2475880	2479680	and now he's being swallowed into that goo there.
2480200	2482160	I can smell him cooking from here, actually.
2482160	2485080	Is that what that butter toast thing is?
2485080	2488760	Yeah, yeah, that's his blubber.
2489640	2492080	He was, you know, he was an inside boy.
2492080	2494040	Not fat, but certainly not fit.
2497760	2498800	Can we do anything?
2499960	2501440	Are you telling me that Keith's dead?
2501440	2503080	No, you can look out the hole.
2503080	2505440	You can see him dying out there and screaming.
2505440	2509200	This is still your turn.
2509200	2512320	So any idea you have is as good as.
2512320	2513160	We still got time.
2513160	2514640	We still got time.
2514640	2516720	Clark is going to search through this magical room
2516720	2518240	one more time for something long
2518240	2521520	that he can throw out there to maybe pull him in with.
2523360	2524480	You find a door.
2528080	2530760	I've been looking through this room to find helpful things.
2530760	2532560	God damn it, I can't find anything.
2532560	2533480	It's an 82.
2535680	2538280	There's so much junk in here, but it's also useless.
2538280	2539560	You find a putter.
2540400	2541240	How about this?
2541240	2542080	How about this?
2542080	2542920	A putter.
2542920	2543760	Is it long enough?
2543760	2544960	You just whang him on the head.
2544960	2546280	Just hit him in the head.
2547280	2548800	Don, use the owl.
2548800	2550160	Phone on me.
2553360	2554640	All right, good turn.
2554640	2555960	Don D. Pettymore.
2558280	2561800	Don is going to continue his chant.
2561800	2563360	Can you give me that one more time?
2563360	2568360	Biza girl, biza girl, biza girl.
2568880	2570000	That was three times.
2571280	2573280	Cause you're special to me.
2573280	2574480	Thanks number 17.
2574480	2575320	Damn it.
2582480	2584720	I don't have 17 friends.
2584720	2585840	All right, and so.
2585840	2587960	Yeah, you were all fools to worry.
2587960	2592960	So, Don is hanging.
2594000	2598800	And as he's hanging, his chant begins reverberating
2598800	2602040	through this entire place.
2608040	2612720	You all feel yourselves freeze,
2612720	2616440	both in space and in time.
2618400	2623400	As the world begins to rewind.
2623440	2624400	Oh my God.
2624400	2628480	You feel yourselves moving backwards,
2628480	2630840	making the exact same movements,
2630840	2633960	only this time in reverse.
2633960	2636320	Clark sets a putter down on the floor
2636320	2638280	in the piston bunk yard.
2638280	2640280	Keith screams out.
2641800	2644120	His legs exist once again.
2644120	2645800	His stomach is content.
2645800	2648480	The taste of blood in his mouth vanishes
2648480	2651800	and the smell of butter melts away.
2651800	2656200	His feet lift up out of the endless ocean of pain
2656200	2658520	and the shock dissipates.
2658520	2660480	A shiny metal door emerges
2660480	2662520	from out of the shimmering silver sea
2662520	2664600	and flings off its steel covering
2664600	2667560	to reveal a colorful black texture.
2667560	2670880	The little twins put lollipops back in their wrappers
2670880	2672600	and into their overalls.
2672600	2676960	The unnaturally hued door sends a spray of liquid metal
2676960	2680200	toward the feral ball that inhabited Julie Maxwell
2680200	2683560	and then flies back up into the junkyard bunker
2683560	2688240	just as John closes a hem made hole in the wall.
2688240	2691800	Clark catches the door and promptly places it
2691800	2693880	under some junk on the floor.
2693880	2698160	Keith's body ascends toward the second stilted bunkers hatch
2698160	2700400	and his sweaty hands grab
2700400	2702720	and immediately release the railing
2702720	2707160	as he is thrust backwards onto the rising bridge
2707160	2710280	and time freezes once again
2710280	2712800	before suddenly stumbling forward
2712800	2715080	in its typical intoxicated manner
2715080	2717440	and Keith leaps toward the hatch,
2717440	2719800	reaches out for the railing
2719800	2723880	and we'll hear that roll on the next episode.
2723880	2724720	Woo.
2724720	2726160	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
2728200	2729040	I fail.
2729040	2731200	Oh well then it just happens again.
2731200	2732040	Okay.
2732040	2733440	Oh should I crit fail?
2734640	2737360	It was a 48 on a 60 just so you know.
2738360	2739520	Oh then we learn now.
2740800	2743400	I thought you were just gonna end it right there.
2743400	2747720	Keith grabs onto the hatch, opens it, grabs the phone,
2747720	2751480	saves everyone in the world and podcasts over.
2752720	2753560	I'm glad you wrote that.
2753560	2754400	Thank you very much.
2754400	2755220	That's the end.
2755220	2756060	Good game.
2756060	2756880	That was wild.
2756880	2757720	That was a great ending.
2757720	2758560	Good round.
2758920	2760160	You guys wanna play again?
2761600	2762440	I do.

2764560	2766400	What if we just played this again?
2766400	2767600	Let's just do this again.
2767600	2768440	Let's just start.
2768440	2770560	I bet you guys would do better.
2770560	2772080	Oh yeah.
