0	3520	What's good, my little buttercups?
3520	7280	It's your cow grease producer wolf, the dog.
7280	10320	And I'm here to deliver all the full fat milk
10320	13760	to all my hungry little babies
13760	18480	who can then shake that cream around until it turns solid.
18480	20600	That's how the butter is made.
20600	25600	Or so I'm told, I am coagulating live from 694.2 PTBP,
25600	29640	the only radio station that artisanally crafts
29640	32880	its own butter for its host to eat.
32880	37080	Speaking of cream, grease, and being told stuff,
37080	39840	we got ourselves a new Howlin' with Wolf.
39840	44280	This Howlin' with Wolf was sent in by Wes from PA,
44280	47640	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,
47640	50760	which is the quickest way to make a notification appear
50760	52840	in the notifications tab,
52840	55600	of the app pretending pod Twitter account.
55600	59320	They write, I just want to thank the beautiful bastards
59320	62760	who make one of the best podcasts out there.
62760	67320	You guys are killing it, may all your balls be smooth.
67320	70320	Well damn, thank you Wes from PA.
70320	75280	I do however, not appreciate how you seem to prefer
75280	79560	smoothness over the feel of beautiful bristles.
79600	82600	What's wrong with petting something that got the feel
82600	86520	of a wire-haired brush dipped in a vat of Vaseline?
86520	88600	Remember, if you want to write up something
88600	91280	for your milk-producing wolf to howl,
91280	93920	tag that pretending pod on the internet.
93920	98240	Come on, you know you want to make me say some silly shit,
98240	102520	like bum-fuzzle, accubation, clique,
102520	105160	and click right down there on those show notes
105160	107800	to find links to all of my videos.
107800	110920	You know you want to make me say some silly shit,
110920	113480	like bum-fuzzle, accubation, clique,
113480	115920	and click right down there on those show notes
115920	120480	to find links to all our ramshackle internet gobbledygook.
120480	123560	Goggle with hogwash and swallow lickety-split,
123560	125680	it's time for the news.
125680	130680	Ahem, I, Wolf the dog, do hereby relinquish my duty
131240	133680	to read the news for this episode,
133760	136920	and that this will be done by an old friend,
136920	140560	Mick and or Nick Nichols.
140560	143680	We met in college where we all studied
143680	145800	talking at people real good.
145800	148360	I got my damn MFA even,
148360	151920	so technically I could be Professor Wolfie,
151920	155480	but y'all know that my heart belongs with the people,
155480	160080	specifically the people whose minds are easily penetrated
160080	162880	by my all-powerful aura.
162920	167640	For one, cannot simply take over the world by just teaching.
167640	170800	You must be able to control them
170800	174760	with the most modern communication vessel of the century,
174760	179760	the most cutting-edge technology, FM radio babies.
181480	184760	Also, the community college I applied to
184760	187600	never got back to me about the job.
187600	190640	Now, slop yourself up enough rubber-boo
190640	193960	to feel the collywobbles and fight the whamble.
193960	198960	It's Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?
199080	201320	["Bad Girls"]
204680	208760	Bad girls on top of the water
208760	212960	Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline
212960	217040	Leaving my mind at your altar
217040	220680	Crossing the double line, doing it every time
220680	225680	Tell me what kind of world are you living in?
229480	234480	What kind of world are you living in?
237840	240320	Whoa, hello, hello, everybody,
240320	244320	and welcome back to the Scrap-O.
244360	245800	Nick Nichols, is this not the,
245800	248160	I'm Nick Nichols and this is Nick Nichols.
249680	250800	Yeah, hey there, brother.
250800	253160	Oh, Nick Nichols, I love that everything I do
253160	254720	just makes you giggle like that.
254720	258080	When your cheeks get rosy, my heart gets fozy,
258080	261520	and that's a word that I mispronounce, like fuzzy is fozy,
261520	264640	and you love it, I love it, we're all here.
264640	267880	We're all here for Nick Nichols, what do you think about that?
267880	271320	Well, I just love you, my elder brother.
272320	275080	And I love you too, my elder brother.
276840	279760	We were both born right before the other one.
279760	281480	I think it's Eldritch brother.
285840	289240	What have you been up to since two seconds ago, Nick?
289240	292160	Well, I've just been watching this cool,
292160	294640	is it a fight, is it a battle, is it a war,
294640	297680	is it, what is it exactly that we're watching here?
297680	301840	I'm not too sure, but it is darn entertaining.
301840	305400	And it's darn entertaining for sure,
305400	307280	and I do think that part of it
307280	310120	might determine the outcome of our futures,
310120	311960	whether it be us in our lives
311960	314880	or the future of humanity, all right, all right, all right.
314880	316480	At least in this reality.
316480	319160	What happens in this reality?
319160	320480	What?
320480	321320	Go on.
321320	324200	Are you saying that there might be different realities, Nick?
324200	325600	I'm just saying we were hugged
325600	328480	by that big old robot friend of ours.
331320	333720	Can you say that again for the folks at home?
337120	339280	Wow, what a way to say a thing.
339280	341800	Well, let's get back to the moment at hand.
341800	345760	You were saying that there might be extra dimensions
345760	349880	or other planes of existence, different realities.
349880	350840	Is that true?
350840	352600	That's just a little theory of mind
352600	353880	that I've been cooking up.
353880	358880	And I like to dabble in metaphysical theories in my off.
359280	361240	Oh, did we lose Luke?
361240	362200	Ignore him.
362200	363320	Okay. I'm still here.
363320	364160	I don't know what happened to my camera.
364160	365000	I got scared.
365000	367040	He switched positions to it frightened me.
367040	368080	I'm back.
368080	369720	And he's back. Hey, we're back.
369720	371400	What is metaphysical?
371400	374440	Have you heard of the physical realm that we all live in?
374440	376120	Not even a little bit.
376120	379000	So there's another one called the metaphysical realm
379000	381160	and it's different.
381160	383240	All right, and so we're gonna give you
383240	385560	a quick recap of last time here.
385560	387880	Last time, that big fucker on the left,
387880	389920	this thing that I've heard a few people on the ground
389920	392400	call the giant dumber up in the case
392400	393600	it reached up and touched the sky,
393600	395480	turned the sky up into an ocean.
395480	398000	Ocean with black starts swirling all around
398000	401000	like a dark lake or a lake or something up there
401000	402240	that you might look into.
402240	407240	And then, blah, and then juggernauts shot and rose M-A-R-Y
407240	412080	and cut that thing in half with its laser eyes.
412080	415000	Oh, God, a bunch of other stuff happened.
415000	418520	Don was in the room up there that we can't see,
418520	419840	but we know what's going on.
419840	420680	Yeah, we know, we know.
420680	421520	Isn't that right, The Giggles?
421520	422520	Yeah, we know what's going on.
422520	424520	He's watching Keith talk through the phone.
424520	428040	And then these creatures, these tall skeletal creatures
428040	430240	that kind of look like Bobby Glass showed up.
430240	434760	I've heard someone here is calling them Myriad.
434760	437000	Well, what a name and what a season.
437000	439760	There's more than one of them, but there wasn't now.
439760	442600	Now we're down to one, and its hand is all shrunk down weird
442600	445440	because this old version of the Clark Bishop
445440	446280	sees through it.
447800	451400	A bunch of them popped like some sort of zits.
451400	452240	Oh, God.
453440	454280	Yummy.
454280	456400	That's right, The Giggles, like some sort of zit.
456400	460480	Oh, God, I definitely threw up just a little bit.
460480	462680	Just enough, and then Clark Bishop
462680	465120	blasted a wide bar of them down the road,
465120	468440	down to one, and out, and out, and out, and out,
468440	472160	and Dawn came running outside, Dawn D. Pennymore.
472160	475360	We got John Ball, Ball version of John D. Pennymore,
475360	479000	lunged at M-A-R-Y, and her top half
479000	481040	is the body of the Rosemary, cut in half,
481040	482880	starts shuffling all back.
482880	485680	John Ball plunged up into the gut,
485680	490680	and then Keith Ligna with his frozen peashooter
491320	493680	comes down and freezes her bottom half
493680	496160	and then smashes off the bottom half.
496160	498560	It's going, it's going, man.
498560	501640	Oh, keep on, keep on, go, go, go, go.
501640	504040	The bottom half shattered into multiple pieces.
504040	505800	Clark Bishop tried to pull out his gun,
505800	508120	accidentally blew his own head off,
508120	510240	and then Blana Juggernaut comes down, boom,
510240	513040	lands all next to Keith's jaw to wheel Pennymore,
513040	516640	fired his gun in the air, hit one of these new sea creatures
516640	518360	that was pretty much in the air.
518360	521280	And then John Ball comes down and blows his own head off,
521280	523200	and then Blana Juggernaut comes down, boom,
523200	524800	lands all next to Keith's jaw,
524840	525760	and then these new sea creatures
525760	527360	that was pouring out of the sky,
527360	530080	the sky that is slowly rising
530080	531440	from its own plane of gravity,
531440	534720	which means that it's lowering slowly towards us.
535840	538800	Yeah, a reality that is truly terrifying.
538800	541480	That's almost like we're gonna be squished here
541480	545200	in a few rounds by this water
545200	548880	with these crazy little worm guys coming out the top.
548880	551520	They're squamish, they're squabish, they're segmented,
551520	554140	and they are purple, brown, and black.
554300	556340	It is getting goopy up in here.
558980	561620	I like that there's panic rising in his voice.
564220	567300	He's like, I haven't thought about the words I'm saying.
567300	570140	Something that really scared me personally, Nick,
570140	573340	is that when John leave Will Fortune more,
573340	576780	shot his gun into the sky and hit one of those worm things,
576780	579820	that worm did not react at all.
579820	583540	Yeah, it's quite, it seems like they might be immune
583980	586340	to physical bullets and such.
586340	588500	Well, that'd be something to keep in mind moving forward.
588500	590940	And we got M-A-R-Y.
590940	593300	This thing plugged in one of its metal sigils
593300	595500	into the ground, seemingly starting to form
595500	597100	some sort of portal.
597100	598980	Over there in the pitch-blark room,
598980	601020	being pitch-blark-roofed,
601020	603860	Keith thinks to ask Muriad on a phone
603860	605820	to get rid of the big thing out there
605820	609680	and bring two McFlurries, one Oreo, one M&M.
609680	611460	That is about Wayne Clark.
611460	612800	This is the older version of Clark,
612920	614040	the overseer told him,
616280	620520	shriveled the last Muriad hand back to its elbow
620520	623920	and tailored its suit so we can all see the results there.
623920	626700	And then Clark Bishop seems to have some sort
626700	629400	of conversation happening with this last little
629400	632100	long-gone translucent beast,
632100	633840	and they seem to agree on something.
633840	636600	It appears to me that Clark is a fan favorite,
636600	637840	and there's so many of them.
637840	641840	You have your own to choose, one without a head,
642160	645240	the old creepy one, and that one,
646120	647320	the good one, I think.
647320	649440	Is any of the Clarks good?
649440	650280	Who can say?
651400	652440	Who can say?
652440	654600	But we do know that Keith Vigna is good,
654600	658480	for he has used his jumping boots to leap up
658480	662440	into the alternate gravity of the world above.
662440	665600	He is shooting his frozen gun right up
665600	667280	into one of these worm's mouths.
667280	669880	The mouth, I have turned green now,
669880	674120	you see him with the mouth inside of mine.
674120	676320	The mouth is completely frozen,
676320	679520	and Keith Vigna dived in, feet first,
679520	684360	like Joda or Elsa, both of them into this worm,
684360	687240	and he has got one from view.
688800	690120	What is happening?
690120	691160	Are you still there?
693760	696560	Uh-oh, Zach, are you still there?
696560	697840	I don't think he is.
697840	698880	Oh no.
698880	700960	Are you happy that I'm still here?
700960	702240	There you go, you're back.
702240	704560	Oh yeah, you're back.
704560	705960	I've turned green.
707280	710840	And with a yee-haw, Keith Vigna disappeared
710840	713160	into that worm up there.
713160	716320	John Ball went and tried to merge with him,
716320	719240	A-R-Y, was repelled like a magnet,
719240	720880	and then Wheel of Fort John here,
720880	722800	we're finally at the end of things, Nick Nickles,
722800	725560	so calm down, you are like, calm down, hey,
725560	726640	sit over there, calm down.
726640	728000	Do not tell me to calm down,
728040	731280	and I am simply pissing my pants in excitement.
731280	734280	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
734280	738760	Wow, and Uncle Don comes running up to Wheel of Fort John,
738760	740400	they're yelling, they're pointing guns,
740400	742240	they're waving around, they're discussing
742240	745240	the reality in nature, much like we are now, reality.
745240	747320	It's just another day in the Pettymore Clan,
747320	748720	as far as we know.
748720	752280	As far as we know, and then John's little tendrils there
752280	754560	at the back of his neck, poked out and seemingly
754600	757800	patted Don on the shoulder to reassure him.
760520	763960	And that's where we'll begin this episode.
765720	768960	Welcome to Pretending to Be People.
768960	770240	I wasn't listening, if you'll just do-
770240	771440	Yeah, could you do that again?
771440	772560	Yeah, please do it again.
772560	774360	I think that'll be handy for all the listeners
774360	775920	who didn't hear Wolf's recap,
775920	777480	and then also didn't pay attention
777480	778840	to what you just said, like us.
778840	781880	Hello, everybody, my name is Frank Nickles,
781880	783600	and with me today is Nick Nickles.
783600	788600	Let's give a quick recap of what happened last time.
790120	790960	Are you ready?
790960	792600	Should we do it again?
792600	795400	Yeah, more recaps is what this podcast needs.
798160	800280	I know it's just fan service,
800280	802520	but, you know, give the people what they want.
807240	808080	Now hear me out.
808920	813920	Oh, this huge lumbering beast that is just towering
817320	822200	story upon story upon story above you all.
822200	826320	It's limbs forming and reforming, shaping and reshaping
826320	829280	in a way to where you can't exactly tell it's the,
829280	832000	oh no, it's there, it's not there.
832000	836520	It is both in this world of this world and nowhere at all.
836560	839400	And it is dripping with this dark ooze,
839400	843200	is it boom, boom, boom,
843200	845600	lumbers across the ground,
845600	849120	always just shrieking out with this.
855120	856600	Every time you make a sound like that,
856600	858880	it just completely cuts out on this chord
858880	861880	from the noise gate filters.
861880	863480	We get the perfect faces for it.
863480	867080	Yeah, there's amazing faces and no sound
867080	870440	except for occasional like, and then, yeah.
871560	872720	And then when the episode comes out,
872720	875240	we get to hear what you wanted us to hear.
875240	877720	My neighbors must be so confused.
877720	880240	Neighbors are like, oh Lord.
880240	882080	It's not even eight in the morning.
882080	882920	Oh God.
885320	889480	The faces are very like vinegar stroke faces.
891280	892120	Jesus.
894080	896320	What's that Luke, for the children listening.
901960	904920	And the Gigantumber pithicus, unbeknownst to you,
904920	906720	is about to come.
908720	911760	I want you guys to really visualize this moment
911760	915040	because the Gigantumber pithicus, last you saw,
915040	917920	had just reached up into the sky,
917920	922840	turned the entirety of the sky into a swirling ocean
922880	924640	with waves coming across it.
924640	928680	And then these like massive worms
928680	931000	started poking their heads out of it.
931000	935120	Next round, this ocean started rising
935120	937360	from its point of view,
937360	942360	which means that it is lowering slowly down onto you.
942360	945160	The Gigantumber pithicus is so tall
945160	949040	that this ocean is now rising almost to its head.
949040	954040	So it bends over and it puts its enormous knot hands
955440	959800	kind of on its joints, down by its legs
959800	964120	that are now the size of skyscrapers themselves.
964120	968240	I mean, we're talking tens of stories tall at this point.
968240	971640	It bends over and it erupts.
971640	974480	Something from deep within it
974480	977920	begins making this horrible noise.
977920	981800	And it's almost as if you hear the souls
981800	986520	of every single person that it has ever engulfed
986520	990600	cry out as its mouth opens
990600	995600	and you see a bevy of skeletons
995600	998920	begin to fall out of its mouth.
998920	1003920	They are all dripping with this same black residue,
1004160	1007520	this puke, this resipuke
1007520	1011000	that is just covering each of these skeletons.
1011000	1014280	And they're all being held by their backs
1014280	1018200	as they're free falling by like a bungee rope,
1018200	1021120	like a marionette doll, like they're marionette dolls,
1021120	1023560	but what the strings holding them
1023560	1028560	are the same strings of like thick, mucusy residue.
1028800	1032160	And these things are crying out in pain,
1033080	1035760	but also they're grabby.
1035760	1038080	They're real grabby with their hands
1038080	1039760	and their arms and their legs.
1039760	1043480	And they are falling down toward this battlefield.
1043480	1046440	Are there like tens of these or thousands of these?
1046440	1047640	Let's go ahead and roll.
1047640	1050400	Let's go ahead and roll and see how many there are.
1051920	1053960	Let's roll like 2D4.
1053960	1056120	Yeah, yeah, do that.
1056120	1056960	There's 12.
1056960	1059960	Oh, okay, so this is like a commando team
1059960	1063320	of skeleton souls, not a horde.
1063320	1064920	That is correct, that is correct.
1064920	1069920	It is a highly trained para skeletal team.
1071920	1074440	I'm imagining, you know, like the angler fish
1074440	1077480	or whatever that has like the little light on its head.
1077480	1079400	Is it kind of like that, but with skeletons?
1079400	1080240	Yeah, okay.
1080240	1082200	Well, no, I don't know what that meant.
1082200	1083040	I don't think so.
1083040	1083880	It's not like that.
1083880	1085880	But I was just saying, yeah, that's a fish.
1085880	1088600	It's more like these skeletons make a giant frog's tongue
1088600	1091280	that's coming out and getting ready to come out
1091280	1093360	and like grab a fly.
1093360	1095000	Yeah, there's 12 frogs tongues.
1095000	1096680	Gotcha, okay, that makes more sense.
1096680	1099640	And on the tip of each tongue is a fun little skeleton
1099640	1101840	doing a little dance as it comes toward you.
1101840	1102880	Yeah.
1102880	1104320	He's coming to give us a hug.
1105320	1106640	I wanna hug the skeleton.
1106640	1108800	Next is Rose M-A-R-Y,
1108800	1112000	which is currently half embodying.
1112000	1117000	It's got one tendril plugged up inside the head of Rosemary
1117120	1121040	and it's been using her mouth like a weird puppet
1121040	1123640	as it's been dragging her body backwards
1123640	1125720	to avoid more hits.
1125720	1128040	It's got one of its other metal tendrils
1128040	1131520	plugged into the luminous land below
1131520	1133440	and to the left of you all
1133440	1138440	and is forming a sort of swirl of technicolor light
1139800	1141440	that is emitting now from the ground.
1141440	1144400	You've seen this before and you know that she is creating
1144400	1146640	or it is creating a portal.
1147520	1151640	M-A-R-Y is going to roll a dodge
1151640	1155440	because she is going to try to keep this portal going
1155440	1157520	for this entire round.
1157520	1160320	And so she's gonna roll a dodge at a negative 20
1160320	1162040	to contest any rolls against her
1162040	1166920	to try to stop this attempt at a portal opening.
1166920	1171480	And she has succeeded with a roll that I will keep to myself.
1171480	1173080	She had a negative 20.
1173080	1175680	Yeah, she was at a negative 20 and she still passed
1175680	1180280	which makes you think, oh, maybe this is kind of low.
1180280	1181880	Maybe this is beatable, yeah.
1181880	1183000	Maybe it's beatable.
1183000	1183840	Beatable.
1183840	1186040	If you say it three times, you'll beat it.
1186040	1187480	Beatable.
1187480	1189720	Like Beetlejuice, nice.
1189720	1190560	I've never seen that.
1190560	1193080	Carry on, it is Keith Vigna's turn.
1193080	1196200	Can you describe exactly where Keith is right now?
1196200	1197240	What happened last time?
1197240	1200480	No, so I'm inside the worm right now, right?
1200480	1201680	Holy shit, yes.
1201680	1203080	Let's die for you.
1203080	1205600	No, no, no, sorry, this Keith Vigna.
1205600	1208160	Sorry, it's Keith Beams' turn.
1208160	1212320	Okay, right, I just got off the phone and I laid back down.
1213200	1215840	Is Don in the room with me still or did he leave?
1215840	1217720	You're not sure, it's pitch black in there.
1217720	1219120	You called out to him last time
1219120	1221160	and asked what kind of McFlurry he wanted.
1221160	1224040	He did not respond and so you assumed him in it.
1224040	1226800	Okay, yeah, so as Keith is, he's laying down on the ground
1226800	1230520	just really having a great time, super relaxed.
1230840	1232200	He's laying down there for a while
1232200	1233840	and then he remembers.
1233840	1237760	He's like, oh yeah, I just asked for a McFlurry.
1237760	1239920	I guess I better go out and meet him.
1239920	1243060	And so I try to find my way out of this room.
1244760	1247320	All right, so I've got a mini game here.
1247320	1249720	It's gonna take about three episodes to play
1249720	1251600	of you getting out of this room.
1252960	1256560	So Justin, you're gonna be Keith Beams' left leg.
1256560	1260120	Joe, you're gonna be Keith Beams' left hand.
1260640	1262520	Thomas, you're gonna be the left foot.
1262520	1266500	And then Luke, you're gonna be Keith Beams' nose.
1266500	1271500	So if you could each roll a D7 and then add negative I.
1272280	1273560	D7, right, got it.
1273560	1275080	Yeah, I'm at six I.
1275080	1275900	Oh, perfect.
1275900	1278800	So you kind of feel your way with your,
1278800	1281840	well, you bump into the side of the room with your nose
1281840	1283920	but only half of your nose gets bumped
1283920	1286480	and you're like, oh, perfect, I'm right at the doorway.
1286480	1289920	And you reach out with Thomas and Justin's left hand
1290600	1291440	and feel around the corner
1291440	1295360	and you kind of feel the stairwell of this enormous room.
1295360	1297680	The enormous room, you feel the stairwell leading down
1297680	1299680	from this towering building.
1299680	1303260	Is there still no light or is there light in the hallway?
1303260	1304920	There's slight light coming down
1304920	1306160	from the bottom of the stairwell
1306160	1307800	and so you make your way down the stairs
1307800	1311680	and out of this towering dark building and you see.
1311680	1314220	Okay, so if he's making his way out,
1314220	1316480	then we'll start with me, left foot.
1316480	1318240	That's right, yes, go ahead and roll.
1318240	1319860	Let's see how that first step goes.
1320740	1323980	Now I rolled a D, I've got my foot character sheet here
1323980	1325260	and anyway.
1327020	1327860	Please tell me you rolled well.
1327860	1330980	I've got a 14, I have to roll higher than a 14 on a D20,
1330980	1332380	I rolled a six, all right.
1332380	1333820	Thanks for like trying to play
1333820	1335580	in the dumbest thing I've ever said.
1337980	1338820	It means a lot.
1338820	1341060	This is, you think the dumbest thing you've ever said?
1344900	1349180	All right, since Keith's left foot failed the foot roll,
1349180	1351060	I stumble down the stairs,
1351060	1353740	just head over, rolling down the stairs.
1353740	1354580	Head over what?
1354580	1356820	Rolling, rolling.
1356820	1359220	Probably butt, because that's fun.
1359220	1363460	Nice, Keith Beans rolls head over butt down the stairs
1363460	1365500	and you land at the bottom of this.
1365500	1366500	Ouchie, ouchie.
1369340	1371460	The last two stairs slapped you
1372340	1376620	and you land ace first
1377540	1378820	down at the bottom of these stairs
1378820	1381620	of the base of this towering tower,
1381620	1384980	this dark building that was first shown
1384980	1388300	in a Polaroid picture from Julie Maxwell's car
1388300	1390900	way back in episode one.
1390900	1395180	And so you look out onto this battlefield ahead of you
1395180	1398900	and you see just pure fucking nonsense.
1398900	1403220	And right about then, Keith has a flashback.
1403220	1408220	You remember you're on the Beans' estate.
1408500	1410180	The alarms start blaring
1411340	1415740	and these creatures begin falling from the sky
1415740	1418540	and hitting the ground with a thud,
1418540	1420820	but they don't seem to be affected
1420820	1423900	by falling from however far they fell.
1423900	1428900	They're tall, gaunt, translucent, wearing black suits
1429900	1432180	and looking out onto this battlefield,
1432180	1433940	darkness surrounding you,
1433940	1437180	light completely illuminating the land.
1437180	1441060	These same creatures are falling from the sky.
1441060	1446060	That memory reminds Keith of Fergie
1446980	1451740	and Keith just kind of breaks down a little bit
1451740	1456180	and he just starts crying, but it's like an angry cry.
1456180	1459300	Wow, he seems to really be having a moment there, Nick.
1459300	1461060	What do you think about that?
1461060	1463580	It's a great emotional time for all of us here,
1463580	1466020	but we're powering through, buddy, am I right?
1466020	1467540	I don't deserve to live.
1469500	1470860	Now they're both just standing
1470860	1472220	on either side of Keith Vigna.
1472220	1474380	Just holding microphones down on his face.
1476940	1478900	Look at Nick and Mick Nichols
1480640	1483660	with both of their microphones held at my face
1483660	1484720	and I'm crying.
1484720	1486740	I've just yelled, I don't deserve to live.
1486740	1488500	I've been thinking about all the atrocities
1488500	1491340	that I've committed throughout my lifetimes
1492220	1496660	and I just start running at one of the men in black.
1496660	1498380	It's the overseer's turn.
1499580	1504580	Clark, Joe, you are become the overseer
1506140	1511140	in that last round, wherein you literally beamed out
1511580	1516580	this same light from your face that you saw him do first
1517540	1520860	and in that moment, something in your consciousness flickered
1521860	1524860	and there's something strange about it.
1524860	1528500	It's like Clark Bishop is still controlling Clark Bishop
1528500	1531300	and the overseer is still the overseer,
1531300	1536300	but you, Joe Terry, author of your own story,
1536580	1538700	have now taken control.
1538700	1540680	Through becoming the overseer,
1540680	1543700	you have become the overseer.
1547500	1549020	Yeah.
1549020	1550100	Yeah, okay.
1550100	1554260	You are floating about 10 feet above
1554260	1557460	the luminous land liturgy that is weaving in and out
1557460	1559900	of itself in a circle, chanting,
1559900	1562060	Shaak Ti Felicha.
1562060	1563560	This is a little bit of a Nick Pex hack,
1563560	1565820	but I don't think you're using liturgy correctly.
1565820	1567380	I never have.
1567380	1569780	As long as you know.
1572260	1574520	I did it for the alliteration.
1575440	1580440	It's just like, let's give this fucker a quick look up
1580440	1582280	because I don't know what it means.
1582280	1583680	Oh, what a liturgy is?
1583680	1585240	It's just like the service.
1585240	1589680	It's the body and texts and songs of the service,
1589680	1590520	I'm pretty sure.
1590520	1593040	Yeah, a form or formulary according to which
1593040	1596920	public religious worship, especially Christian worship,
1596920	1598040	is conducted.
1598040	1600960	It's the ritual, the service, the ceremony.
1602360	1603200	Yeah, I'm good with that.
1603200	1606360	So this luminous land liturgy is just like weaving,
1606360	1610140	bobbing and weaving in and around in a circle around you.
1610140	1613040	And it's just liturgying all over your liturgy.
1613040	1615860	And you feel the liturgy within your liturgy.
1617440	1618600	You're liturgid.
1621400	1624880	And you feel this immense power that is being given to you,
1624880	1627980	granted to you by this song, by this chant.
1627980	1631200	And it is flowing within you and giving you what you think
1631200	1634440	is an unnatural score of at least 85.
1635420	1636960	No, sorry, 86.
1636960	1638800	Now I'm going to put down 85.
1638800	1640280	That's what I said and that's what I meant.
1640280	1641920	That's what you said and I said sick after it
1641920	1643820	so it's official now.
1643820	1647720	Yes, it's like in a meeting we don't second things.
1647720	1651360	We just say sick and then it's not only seconded,
1651360	1653120	not only voted on, it's finished.
1654040	1656360	Okay, I have a sick, do I have a righteous?
1657800	1659960	I have a righteous, the motion carries.
1659960	1661760	It's like when Jesus was dying on the cross
1661760	1664960	and at the very end he was just like, sick.
1664960	1666120	And then he got to die.
1667880	1669460	Best thing he ever did.
1669460	1671960	Terrible timing but I have to poop
1671960	1674200	and I'll make it very, very quick.
1674200	1676400	But I am going to shit my pants.
1679920	1681840	It was just starting to feel liturgical.
1681840	1684600	Oh man, oh God, he's doing it.
1684600	1687560	Oh, he's pooping right, oh Thomas.
1687560	1689800	Stop staring right into the camera.
1690520	1693360	You're gonna regret this man, you're gonna regret this.
1693360	1695760	Oh no, he's showing it to us now.
1695760	1697640	No, I don't wanna see it.
1697640	1700280	That's what his asshole looks like, huh?
1700280	1703280	He is in the living room showing me his butt right now.
1704640	1707200	Why is he pooping into a mesh strainer?
1708920	1710800	What the fuck is wrong with him?
1710800	1715160	Oh, he's wiping it on his face and on the walls now, what?
1715160	1718800	He's holding up a sign that says Luke made me do this?
1718800	1720760	I didn't make him do it, stop.
1720760	1723840	Guy's holding up a newspaper but it's from 10 years ago.
1726720	1728020	What is he telling us?
1732040	1735600	Wait, what is he writing with his own feces on the wall?
1735600	1738760	Oh, Sirhan Sirhan should get probation?
1738760	1739580	That's weird.
1741280	1744860	All right, so now that Thomas has silently cleaned up
1744860	1747120	all of his mess that he made on the floor.
1747120	1748400	Yeah, that was disgusting.
1748400	1750360	I don't understand what just happened.
1750360	1752840	Thomas, what was the point of the newspaper?
1752840	1755320	I thought that was pretty self-explanatory
1755320	1757920	but if you don't get it, I mean,
1757920	1761240	not everybody's, I guess, as sophisticated as I am.
1761240	1762480	A man of culture.
1762480	1765660	Obviously, I still have the shit all over my face.
1765660	1766500	Right.
1766500	1767960	That's right.
1767960	1770000	My glorious war paint and...
1773000	1774840	Oh no, you can't taint it.
1774840	1776680	That's not subtly that moment.
1777240	1779200	You can't taint it like that.
1779200	1782000	That was the coolest thing we've done in the show so far.
1783560	1785300	Well, now the coolest thing we've done
1785300	1788060	is one of the hosts smeared shit all over his face
1788060	1791680	to gain a psychological advantage over all of the others.
1793240	1796680	Cause you're all wondering what's going on
1796680	1798160	in this guy's mind right now.
1799660	1802400	And to give Joe a good amount of time
1802400	1806880	to think about what he's gonna do as the overseer.
1806880	1809400	That would have been a smart thing for Joe to do, for sure.
1809400	1810240	Oh!
1810240	1812400	Yeah, it would have been.
1812400	1814960	For sure, for sure, for sure.
1814960	1816000	Oh, you made me laugh
1816000	1818080	while I was still adjusting the microphone.
1819120	1822580	I do have an idea, kinda, but I wanna ask,
1822580	1824360	now that my reality is shifting
1824360	1827580	and I'm getting some insight into the overseer's head,
1827580	1830400	can I dig around in there a little bit and see what I know?
1830400	1832180	Hondo P, baby.
1832180	1833440	Oh, what are you looking for?
1833440	1835840	Well, in the immediate, he was gonna look for some spells.
1835840	1838820	And my goal, since I now have a Clark Gold,
1838820	1841360	I have an overseer, and I've also got a Clark
1841360	1842640	who has just recently proven
1842640	1845540	that he can handle some level of skill.
1845540	1847540	I wanna see if there are extra spells
1847540	1849380	rattling around in overseer's head
1849380	1853180	that he can pass along to me Clark, Clark Current.
1853180	1854220	Clark me.
1854220	1855580	And divide forces.
1855580	1857840	If me Clark needs to go be working on something
1857840	1860300	while overseer's working on something else,
1860340	1863540	I feel like Clark Gold has the tactical command here
1863540	1865340	and he needs to delegate.
1865340	1867220	He's obviously had an end goal in mind.
1867220	1869140	Let's make that happen.
1869140	1872900	So you know that he is scared, which is weird,
1872900	1875540	because the same time you feel all of this power,
1875540	1878220	you feel an immense amount of fear,
1878220	1882460	and it is all directed at this creature.
1882460	1885100	Whatever you want to do,
1885100	1887060	whatever you want to impart
1887060	1891020	onto this younger version of yourself,
1891020	1895380	you feel good about being able to do that.
1895380	1896720	So yeah, that's kind of what I was gonna say.
1896720	1899780	I wanted to make sure that he has a chance to right now
1899780	1902900	with this moment of noticing, oh shit, my Clark,
1902900	1905180	my younger Clark is capable.
1905180	1908220	I wanna use this time to tell him what he needs to do.
1908220	1910980	You as Clark Bishop, which he would have seen,
1910980	1912400	you just had this conversation
1912400	1916460	with the only tall, gaunt creature last time,
1916740	1920400	and you both agreed the Lumbering Beast was the issue,
1920400	1924140	and now a bunch of those things have just appeared,
1924140	1926580	you would assume to help.
1926580	1929300	You can think about the abilities that they've used, right?
1929300	1930140	So.
1930140	1931940	Freeze a person in place.
1931940	1932780	Yeah.
1932780	1933940	Yep, and wipe a mind.
1933940	1938420	So you think that if they can hold this thing in place,
1938420	1941460	then you guys can probably eliminate it.
1941460	1946460	Also, you do see 12 fucking goopy skeletons
1946460	1949940	are coming down, and those need to be addressed this round.
1949940	1951540	Okay, this round, I don't know.
1951540	1953900	I was gonna say, my thought was,
1953900	1956980	with the paralyzing power of those,
1956980	1958380	of our Marvin creatures,
1958380	1961260	that they could stop those skeletons in their tracks.
1961260	1963060	I assume that the Overseer knows
1963060	1965560	that he needs people around him to keep this power level up,
1965560	1967340	so he wants to make sure that those skeletons
1967340	1968500	can't take any more people.
1968500	1970180	So maybe that's what this Overseer
1970180	1973060	is going to focus on, is those skeletons.
1973980	1976480	Overseer's gonna stop those things in their tracks.
1981120	1982360	Or he's gonna try.
1987360	1989020	No, he doesn't.
1989020	1990740	Holy shit. It's a 93.
1990740	1991860	I rolled a 93.
1991860	1994100	Oh my God.
1994100	1996660	Clark Bishop, you've just looked over
1996660	1999940	and seen the Overseer reach out,
1999940	2004940	attempt something against these falling, lost bones,
2005620	2009820	these rattling bones that are just dripping with ooze
2009820	2012120	as they're falling down toward you,
2012980	2017780	and it does not work, and you see his face drop.
2017780	2018780	Yeah.
2018780	2020260	This is your moment.
2023160	2024340	It's Clark Bishop's turn.
2024340	2028380	This Clark is aware of this mind split,
2028380	2033380	and he feels what the Overseer was trying to do,
2033380	2035100	and so he's gonna try it himself.
2035100	2037180	He's gonna take up the mantle of,
2037180	2038340	all right, I see what you were doing.
2038340	2039220	I see what you were doing.
2039220	2041140	All right, okay, here we go.
2041140	2046140	That is a 20 on a 63 is what this Clark's Unnatural is.
2046140	2046980	Hell yeah, dude.
2046980	2050420	He's gonna just channel everything he was feeling
2050420	2053820	from the Overseer and just tweak it.
2054180	2055340	He saw where he messed up.
2055340	2056620	It was right there,
2056620	2059740	and he just tweaks the thing in his mind,
2059740	2061620	and that's the, oh shit,
2061620	2062820	that's where the Overseer fucked up.
2062820	2064220	Here we go, click.
2064220	2068060	And part of your mind just fucking breaks in that moment.
2068060	2069060	Roll sanity.
2071020	2076020	As you analyze the Unnatural nature of the universe
2078080	2080820	in which your mind currently exists.
2080820	2082140	Do not pass.
2082180	2084660	It's a 82 on a five.
2085580	2087820	Lose one sanity.
2087820	2089100	You know what that does, boy.
2089100	2090300	Yeah, that's a breaking point.
2090300	2091140	Showing up.
2092460	2094240	So you're gonna lose one sanity
2094240	2098620	as you handle this situation,
2098620	2100200	and handle it you do,
2100200	2103340	because the losing of the sanity is knowing
2103340	2106740	that you are fucking in control now.
2106740	2110220	You don't have a lot left of your humanity,
2110220	2115220	but you're the most powerful fucker on the field, so.
2117100	2117940	Dope.
2119100	2122140	All right, go ahead and roll three D100 rolls, Joe,
2122140	2126740	and holler what you roll.
2126740	2127580	A 34.
2131220	2132620	A 75.
2136380	2137500	And a 12.
2137540	2142340	34 is dermatillomania compulsion
2142340	2144580	for picking at one's skin.
2144580	2145900	Nasty.
2145900	2147260	I could see ways to use that
2147260	2148980	now that he's like split his body.
2150500	2151340	Oh, God.
2151340	2156340	75 is onomatomania irresistible desire
2159640	2161740	to repeat certain words.
2161740	2163460	Ooh, that's interesting.
2163460	2164940	Now that I'm casting spells.
2165260	2166100	Yep.
2166980	2168940	And 12.
2168940	2173940	12 is aminomania irrational cheerfulness.
2177500	2180900	I love all three of these.
2180900	2181940	Oh, shit.
2181940	2184740	So aminomania is what I live with.
2186900	2188760	I can role play that one real easy.
2188760	2189620	I kind of want to do that.
2189620	2190860	I kind of think it'd be funny for him
2190860	2192380	to be the most optimistic person
2192380	2196760	in this total hellscape of a grim scenario.
2197980	2199620	I completely agree.
2199620	2200460	Yeah, let's do it.
2200460	2201300	Let's do that one.
2201300	2202260	Aminomania.
2202260	2203100	That's perfect.
2203100	2205220	So Joe, what does Clark Bishop do
2207100	2212100	to stave off the invasion of these falling bungee jumping
2212420	2216700	frog into the frog tongue skeletons?
2218420	2219740	I was kind of hoping you'd tell me.
2219740	2222020	I know that the overseer was last seen.
2222540	2223380	You said he extended his hand.
2223380	2225420	So I think Clark's starting with that.
2225420	2227540	He's got a big smile on his face
2227540	2228500	because he's figured it out.
2228500	2231340	He knows what's going on and it's all going to be fine.
2231340	2232960	And he does it.
2232960	2233800	I don't know.
2233800	2235940	Did you picture some of these powers?
2235940	2236860	How strong is this?
2236860	2240180	Can they start shattering
2240180	2242660	or are they just decommissioned shortly?
2242660	2244220	You can do whatever you want.
2244220	2248660	There's dripping skeletons that are coming down.
2248660	2249620	He wants to shatter them.
2250020	2253620	He wants them to pop as though those couple of myriads
2253620	2255060	he did, but these are bones.
2255060	2258300	So he knows that this is more of a break and less of a pop,
2258300	2260300	but he wants them to shatter and crumble.
2260300	2261860	Okay.
2261860	2263460	Fucking cool.
2263460	2267060	And let's go ahead and roll 2D12
2267060	2270660	to see how many of these guys you can get.
2272260	2273440	First one's a two.
2274340	2275180	Uh-oh.
2275180	2278580	Second one is a motherfucking one.
2278580	2279540	I shit you not.
2280420	2281780	Oh my God.
2281780	2283100	I rolled a two and a one.
2283100	2284860	Let's just pretend if we were rolling three,
2284860	2286000	it would have been a 10.
2286000	2286840	So.
2286840	2291840	So three of these skeletons.
2293820	2294900	God damn it.
2294900	2295800	It makes sense.
2295800	2298640	This was young Clark who shot the spell off.
2298640	2301100	That's why it was only three.
2302180	2303140	Yeah.
2303140	2304700	He's just blossoming.
2304700	2306180	He's just blooming.
2306180	2307220	Figuring out his powers.
2307220	2309060	He's going to get the hang of it.
2309500	2310340	This is a good start.
2310340	2312260	These things completely disintegrate
2312260	2315180	and their bones as they turn into dust
2315180	2318460	kind of meld with the residue that's around them.
2318460	2321980	And it turns into like residue mud.
2321980	2325780	It's like the liquid of the ooze and the muck
2325780	2328980	with the sand now, like bone sand
2328980	2331660	just kind of forms together in this.
2331660	2332500	Gritty.
2332500	2333720	Yeah.
2333720	2334560	Yeah.
2334560	2335380	He's there too.
2335380	2338020	Is it like when you throw sand on diarrhea?
2338900	2339740	Thomas.
2342820	2343660	Yes.
2343660	2346460	It's like throwing sand on diarrhea
2346460	2348660	while holding up a newspaper from 10 years ago.
2348660	2352820	And with that, the other skeletons are still coming down.
2352820	2354840	Don D. Pettymore.
2354840	2355820	It's your turn.
2355820	2360500	You're in conversation with John Lee Pettymore III.
2360500	2364660	He's given me a mild embrace with his tendrils.
2364660	2365580	That's right.
2365580	2367820	Just a pat on the back to reassure you.
2368500	2369660	I kind of like grab it
2369660	2371260	like you would like someone's hand
2371260	2373660	and I'm like kind of like affectionately
2373660	2374580	like grabbing it.
2374580	2375420	Yeah, grabbing.
2375420	2376580	Yeah, you're doing it.
2376580	2380380	Like grabbing the hand on my, the hand,
2380380	2383340	the metal tendril as though it was John's.
2383340	2384540	Yeah, he's patting your shoulder
2384540	2385620	with his metal tendrils
2385620	2387780	and you put your hand on the metal tendrils
2387780	2389260	and kind of pat back.
2389260	2391220	Tell me what I need to do, John.
2391220	2393580	Tell me what I can do to help make things right.
2394540	2398260	You feel the tendril slip into your spine.
2398260	2399380	Oh, shit.
2402380	2403220	Yes.
2406580	2409140	Oh, shit.
2409140	2412780	And the ball comes out of John Lee Pettymore.
2412780	2415140	He's kind of hanging limp
2415140	2417780	and there's just a silver ball floating
2417780	2419900	a few feet above him.
2419900	2421860	And it all feels right though.
2421900	2425060	As you feel more and more tendrils
2425060	2428020	moving down your spine
2428020	2430900	and experiencing your nerves
2430900	2434260	and suddenly you and your nephew
2434260	2438500	are kind of the same thing.
2443780	2445100	Holy shit.
2445100	2446940	Sorry.
2446940	2449980	Did you take his spine out first?
2449980	2450820	No, no, no.
2450820	2453020	Just attach yourself to it.
2453020	2456260	He's just been attached to the John of Fortune
2456260	2458260	and he's part of that wheel of fate now.
2459660	2462340	So we can also nix all that.
2462340	2466340	I want Don to still be a character,
2466340	2468580	but essentially he and John
2468580	2470700	might just be talking heads.
2470700	2472060	I don't want to take away all of John.
2472060	2473300	I just literally took away
2473300	2475460	all of Justin's character's agency,
2475460	2476420	which we can.
2477420	2480260	86 right off the bat.
2481260	2483580	I just thought it might be wicked cool.
2483580	2484500	Justin, how do you feel?
2484500	2485340	Yeah, how do you feel, Justin?
2485340	2487820	I don't mind at all about you taking away my agency.
2487820	2488740	That's totally fine.
2488740	2493380	I'm just curious of your motivation for wanting my body.
2493380	2495380	Okay, that's what I don't know.
2495380	2496620	That's what I don't know.
2498620	2501020	But I kind of imagined John and Don
2501020	2503580	as a second Nick and Mick
2503580	2505340	and they're just heads.
2505340	2506180	Oh no.
2507340	2508380	That are literally like,
2508380	2510700	okay, so imagine the tiny ball
2510700	2514900	and then thick stocks of tendrils coming down
2514900	2519220	forming essentially two legs with Don and John
2519220	2521620	and it's just running around like an at-at.
2522780	2525540	Oh my God, I love that so much
2525540	2527100	and we'll see what comes of that.
2527100	2527940	You look next to you
2527940	2531780	and you see the body of John Lee Pettymore
2531780	2536780	kind of hanging limply from this massive stock of tendrils
2536900	2539860	that has started to come down from this very tiny ball
2539860	2542900	and he kind of looks over at you expectantly
2542900	2545020	and with a smile.
2545020	2549380	He says, Don, I know in your life you were mostly an outlaw
2549380	2552780	but I was a law man and that means I'm here to help.
2552780	2554220	So that's what we're gonna do here today
2554220	2555660	and I need your help with that
2555660	2558380	which is why I've taken your body from you
2558380	2562260	but I still respect your criminal mind.
2564300	2566900	So I've left you that.
2567940	2570620	You'll see here if you kind of look up
2570620	2573460	and look around at what's going on here.
2573460	2576060	I've taken over your central nervous system
2576060	2580460	and now you're a part of a John and Don.
2580460	2582140	It's kind of like an at-at.
2582140	2583780	You like Star Wars, Uncle Don?
2583780	2585640	Love Star Wars, boy.
2585640	2587020	Where are the legs of a little,
2587020	2589740	oh, I said at-at, it's actually an AT-ST.
2589740	2591260	The scout trooper, right?
2591260	2592900	What does AT-AT stand for?
2592900	2593980	Attack, attack.
2597260	2599020	The AT-STs are the small one.
2599020	2602140	Yeah, AT-AT is the four legs, AT-ST is two.
2602140	2604260	Scout transport.
2604260	2605980	Listen, Uncle Don.
2605980	2610020	What we are is a swift, highly mobile ball
2610020	2614260	with the minds of two wily Pettymores, chicken walker.
2615140	2617260	We're gonna get out there on that battlefield
2617260	2621100	and we're gonna be where we're needed and help who we can.
2621100	2622740	Does that sound amenable to you?
2622740	2626060	Don has like kind of like tears running down his eyes
2626060	2628160	when this starts happening,
2628160	2632260	as he's like finally able to like let go of all the stress
2632260	2633960	now that he's no longer in control.
2633960	2636800	And he's like, it sounds wonderful.
2638420	2639740	Fuck yeah.
2639740	2642580	John's head like gives a little nod
2642620	2646020	and then you get wicked whiplash
2646020	2649440	as this thing runs off towards the skeletons.
2653780	2655700	Real fast, will you describe the image of it
2655700	2657020	one more time for me?
2657020	2658100	What's the setup?
2658100	2663100	Imagine, imagine a tiny ball with the legs of an AT-ST.
2664380	2665860	So these tendrils have come out
2665860	2670860	and they formed into thick, powerful leg trunks.
2671460	2674700	Like you might find on an AT-ST
2674700	2678740	and where their shins and feet would be,
2678740	2682200	that's the, those are the bodies of John and Don
2682200	2685380	with their heads at like the kneecaps.
2685380	2687300	Gotcha, gotcha.
2687300	2689940	They're like Pacific Rim mind melded together.
2689940	2693740	Yeah, they're kind of just like crucified on this thing.
2693740	2695380	Yeah, but they look cheerful.
2695380	2696980	Crying kneecaps.
2696980	2700360	Yeah, cheerfully, cheerfully crying kneecap.
2701060	2702060	Don Deep anymore.
2704220	2705060	This is great.
2705060	2709420	Okay, that was Don's turn somehow.
2715120	2716340	Great turn, great turn.
2717340	2718840	Good job, good job.
2720860	2721940	That's good.
2721940	2726700	It is John's turn and it is not this ball John's turn,
2726700	2730820	but rather it is the ball John that has been repelled
2731780	2736580	like a magnet away from the ball of Rosemary, M-A-R-Y.
2736580	2739520	Basically John Ball is taken aback
2739520	2743440	by being repulsed from Ballmary.
2744700	2746340	He's floating there for a second
2747220	2750220	and then he sees her starting to open like the portal.
2750220	2751120	Starting.
2752300	2753880	He sees her starting to open the portal
2753880	2757920	and very quickly long spindly like tendrils
2757920	2759760	shoot out of him.
2759760	2762760	He's trying to move the material of the world back,
2762760	2765120	like fill it back in where she's opening the portal.
2765120	2767120	Nice, hell yeah.
2767120	2767960	I dig it.
2767960	2769920	It's frantically like a kid in a sandbox.
2769920	2773360	He's just like trying to scoop the world into her hole.
2774640	2775480	Yeah.
2778280	2780280	Like a kid in a sandbox.
2781200	2782040	Yeah.
2784880	2786360	All right.
2786360	2788560	She just failed her unnatural role
2788560	2792220	and so if you can pass yours, then this happens.
2796160	2798000	43 on a 67.
2798000	2798840	Well done.
2805640	2806480	Moving on.
2809000	2811360	I pour the world into her hole.
2811360	2815520	Yeah, and now it is the Sky Sea Keith.
2815520	2816720	Keith has just
2819280	2822160	filled up a worm's mouth
2823840	2828240	with this liquid nitrogen, this frozen material
2828240	2832440	completely creating an ice luge
2832440	2835720	like a water slide down there at Splashylvania
2835720	2839440	but in winter time as if the entire encasement tube
2839480	2843840	has been frozen and feet first he goes right on in there
2843840	2845600	and Keith, let me tell you,
2845600	2849840	the things that you see blow your fucking mind
2849840	2854680	because you are now just surrounded in this ice world.
2854680	2857080	It is cold as fuck in here
2857080	2862080	and you see almost like a translucent ice barrier
2862400	2864920	surrounding you all around you
2864920	2869280	and on the other side of it are just dazzling shapes
2870000	2875000	and colors, large shadows, just all of these movements
2875920	2880440	like you're at an aquarium, like a psychedelic aquarium
2880440	2884600	but the entire pane of glass has been frosted over.
2884600	2889480	How big am I like, what am I trying to ask?
2889480	2890840	You've got elbow room.
2890840	2893800	Okay, I'm not like completely sucked in
2893800	2896520	like to the esophagus or whatever.
2896520	2898080	You got two elbows room.
2898080	2900160	Two elbows room, okay, tight.
2901080	2904880	Keith looks around and he's amazed.
2904880	2906400	He's kind of like entranced
2906400	2908400	and he's just kind of staring off
2908400	2911320	and looking at the shapes and the shadows and everything
2911320	2915720	and then he snaps out of it and he remembers why he's here
2915720	2918840	and he tries to just punch through,
2918840	2923840	basically punch his way out of this frozen worm's stomach
2924040	2927000	or whatever part of the body I'm in.
2927000	2928400	Sure, yeah, go ahead and roll.
2928400	2931840	Okay, it's a 36.
2931840	2935120	I feel like that's gonna be good, but let's find out.
2935120	2936000	What?
2936000	2939440	40%, so I pass with 36.
2939440	2941360	Excellent. Nice.
2941360	2945400	Also, remember I have these pneumatic arm things too
2945400	2948440	so my punch is extra strong.
2950600	2953120	Yes, and with that, you are going to be able
2953120	2956040	to shatter this worm from the inside.
2956080	2958160	As this thing shatters,
2958160	2962240	cold water begins pouring in all around you.
2962240	2964680	You swim up to the top.
2964680	2968080	You can grab onto one of these frozen insides,
2968080	2972040	pieces of this thing to kind of raft you,
2972040	2974680	help you hold on to the top of this water
2974680	2978200	as waves are unnaturally coming at you from left, right,
2978200	2979600	from front, from back.
2979600	2980760	They're going past you.
2980760	2982160	They're coming from within you.
2982160	2986080	Like it's just, the water is not reacting like normal water
2986080	2987520	and as you're looking up over the top
2987520	2989080	of any of these cresting waves,
2989080	2993960	you see worm after worm coming up, diving back in.
2993960	2996920	You look down, you can't see anything.
2996920	2997960	You can't see your body.
2997960	2998880	You can't see your feet.
2998880	3002080	The water is completely dark and looking above you,
3003120	3007080	your sky is a luminous ground
3007080	3010760	that this fight is being fought on
3010760	3012960	and that is your ceiling.
3012960	3014240	How many worms are there?
3014240	3016080	I was under the impression there were two,
3016080	3019080	but are there just a bunch swimming around in here?
3019080	3020560	Yeah, there's more than two.
3022560	3024000	Well, that's not good.
3024000	3026040	Why did you think there was two?
3027120	3027960	I don't know.
3027960	3030240	I thought there were just two for some reason.
3030240	3031840	And Keith immediately thinks to himself,
3031840	3034960	fuck, I should not have done this.
3034960	3038320	That's exactly what Keith thinks.
3038320	3043320	Yeah, he finds a door-sized frozen piece of worm
3045040	3047880	and he climbs on top of it and he looks
3047880	3051840	and he sees a worm come up like a dolphin would
3051840	3052680	or something.
3054680	3056520	It winks at you.
3056520	3060960	And it winks at me and Keith thinks,
3062600	3065160	I'm gonna have to do a lot of this.
3065160	3068720	And he lunges at the worm that's near him.
3069760	3070600	Hell yeah.
3070600	3072560	From on top of the frozen piece of worm.
3075600	3077640	That's so bad ass.
3077640	3079320	Also, I'm glad you're up in the sky,
3079320	3080920	but now it makes a lot more sense
3080920	3083080	why you went there if you thought like,
3083080	3084760	after you got to that first worm,
3084760	3087160	like halfway done, there's only one more.
3088840	3090680	Upon realizing his mistake,
3090680	3092800	Keith is like, well, I'm here anyway,
3092840	3095520	so might as well just get to it.
3097360	3098960	Hell yeah.
3098960	3100080	Doers get it done.
3100080	3101280	Planet Juggernaut.
3101280	3106280	Planet Juggernaut had been eerily still last turn
3106560	3108520	and you heard whirring inside of him.
3108520	3110080	How many turns did that take?
3110080	3111080	One.
3111080	3112400	Oh, cool.
3112400	3115360	Planet Juggernaut starts rolling
3115360	3117080	almost imperceptibly at first,
3117080	3120440	but then it's faster than you can really imagine.
3120440	3123800	And he's heading towards those fucking skeletons
3123800	3125240	like they're bowling pins.
3126120	3126960	Yeah.
3126960	3129240	They're coming down from the sky
3129240	3130640	and Planet Juggernaut,
3131960	3134360	I mean, this thing is spinning, spinning, spinning,
3134360	3135200	spinning, spinning,
3135200	3137840	and then all of a sudden it launches itself
3137840	3140640	up into the air and is going to take out
3140640	3144800	and fitting their nine bowling pin skeletons
3144800	3145680	left in the air,
3145680	3146880	which is how many are left
3146880	3149480	after I have thrown one bowling ball.
3151120	3153200	Cause it's like I only hit one.
3153200	3154040	Yeah.
3154040	3155520	It's wild that you can only hit one
3155520	3157040	with the bumpers even.
3160320	3162440	Yeah, we put the bumpers on and played golf rules.
3162440	3163720	Exactly, lowest score.
3165960	3167320	That actually sounds really game.
3167320	3169080	Yeah, that sounds doable.
3169080	3170480	It sounds like you created something here
3170480	3171760	that we got to give a try.
3173280	3174320	Don't put this episode out.
3174320	3175560	We got to patent this.
3175560	3176400	Yeah.
3177400	3180720	Bowling golf is going to make us a million bucks.
3180720	3182680	It's going to be huge.
3182680	3185360	From the creators of the fuck barrel.
3185360	3186680	Yeah, what's your company do?
3186680	3188840	Oh, we're a podcast company
3188840	3189680	who makes the fuck barrel.
3189680	3191800	We're a multimedia conglomerate
3191800	3195640	that puts out some audio entertainment,
3196560	3198760	at home leisure projects,
3198760	3201960	and we also run a professional sporting enterprise.
3203840	3206080	At home leisure projects.
3206600	3208000	Products, you know.
3208000	3208840	Products.
3208840	3209680	Personal.
3209680	3210640	Roll bowling.
3210640	3211800	Look on your foot sheet.
3211800	3213120	Should I just roll a D10?
3213120	3215240	No, go ahead and roll two D12.
3215240	3216080	Two D12.
3217320	3219800	It's the one that looks like a D20, but isn't.
3219800	3222400	I had to remind myself when I was searching for it.
3223240	3224080	Okay.
3227240	3229040	15 and 11 and a four.
3229040	3230360	Do you know what that'll do?
3230360	3231840	Take out all nine skeletons?
3231840	3233160	That'll take out all nine skeletons.
3233160	3234000	Hell yeah.
3236400	3238320	Can I describe what happens?
3238320	3241240	Can you leave one so that I can describe how cool it is
3241240	3242920	when it grabs Drew Andrews
3242920	3246000	and rips him back into the mouth of a giantum rapithecus?
3246000	3247080	Yeah, you can leave one.
3247080	3247920	That's fine.
3247920	3249240	No.
3249240	3252200	No, you're not going to do that to our baby boy.
3252200	3253040	Would have been cool.
3253040	3254360	Would have been the body of Drew or Drew?
3254360	3258240	Oh, when you say Drew Andrews, you mean Drew pages?
3258240	3260040	I mean, when I say Drew Andrews,
3260040	3262320	I mean the body of Councilwoman Kerry pages,
3262320	3265800	but yeah, let's move on to a description from Thomas
3266400	3267240	about how fucking cool this is.
3267240	3268080	Right.
3268080	3271200	So you mentioned that they're flying down from the air.
3271200	3274800	So Planet Juggernaut has flown up to meet him,
3274800	3277720	almost like he hit a ridge in the world
3277720	3279280	as he was rolling or something.
3279280	3283440	And maybe you even see one appear before him just briefly,
3283440	3284640	but you can't be sure.
3284640	3286320	Something strange happens.
3286320	3289040	As Planet Juggernaut is rising up into the air,
3289040	3291360	heading towards these skeletons,
3291360	3295200	he kind of blocks your view of them for a second.
3295480	3297280	He rises up to where they were.
3297280	3299160	And as you come down,
3299160	3303840	you see just like a string of ichor shooting back up
3303840	3305360	into this thing's mouth.
3305360	3307240	And where Planet Juggernaut hits the ground
3307240	3309040	and starts rolling again,
3309040	3313880	you see like black chewing gum just stuck to the side
3315920	3317760	of his like chassis.
3317760	3321440	And you see like some rib cages and shit sticking out.
3322280	3325560	But these things are just like completely waffled on him.
3325560	3327960	This is how it feels to chew five gum.
3333240	3336320	And because you rolled so high above the nine,
3337480	3341920	think about an AT-AT and think about Luke Skywalker
3341920	3344760	and think about this Gigantumbropithecus
3344760	3346920	and think about how you've got its tongue.
3346920	3349160	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3353440	3355080	Those are Joe's vinegar strokes.
3359360	3362120	So Planet Juggernaut, as his turn ends,
3362120	3365200	you just see him starting to take a long, graceful turn
3365200	3367720	around the feet of the Gigantumbropithecus.
3368560	3369400	Yes.
3369400	3370240	Awesome.
3370240	3371080	Yes.
3372760	3377280	Oh, and as Planet Juggernaut picks up that spare,
3377280	3381440	we've gone through another round of combat here, Nick Nichols.
3381440	3382920	That's absolutely amazing.
3382920	3385880	I think we owe our lives to our one true god,
3385880	3387200	Planet Juggernaut.
3387200	3388880	Praise be to the Juggernaut.
3388880	3390560	Praise be to the Juggernaut.
3390560	3392000	Now, did you think, Nick,
3392000	3394600	that it was going to be one episode
3394600	3396640	per one round of combat here?
3397560	3401120	You know, I wanted to say no, but that's just it.
3401120	3402680	It happened.
3402680	3404000	We had all hoped not.
3407840	3410080	What I specifically hated about D&D
3410080	3414280	was waiting for everyone else to take their turn forever.
3415280	3418920	And instead, I just took three 30-minute turns this game.
3422920	3424560	One of which was Justin's.
3424560	3427400	Right?
3454560	3463560	What kind of world are you living in?
3463560	3473560	What kind of world are you living in?
3473560	3483560	What kind of world are you living in?
3483560	3491560	What kind of world are you living in?
3491560	3499560	What kind of world are you living in?
