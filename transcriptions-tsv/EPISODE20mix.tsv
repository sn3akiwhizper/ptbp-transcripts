0	8880	Greetings my sheeple, it's your shepherd, wolf the dog, and I'm here to shear all your
8880	13120	wooly little coats so y'all can be a little more comfortable today.
13120	18040	And when I say shear your coats, I really mean give y'all some updates on what's really
18040	25000	going down here in contention from 694.2 PTBP my babies.
25000	29540	This week on Howlin' with Wolf, your best buddy wolf is gonna read one of those fine
29540	36540	5 star reviews from iTunes because it makes wolf feel oh so nice and makes him feel like
36540	42740	he's part of a community instead of just isolated in this basement studio here in dreary old
42740	43740	contention.
43740	53540	Emma Mara was kind enough to write a 5 star review titled Horror, Jokes, and Mystery!
53540	59460	The review reads, A really great listen if you love D&D podcasts that have a strong narrative
59540	60740	focus.
60740	65100	Really fun for those of us that care more about the mystery than about the mechanics
65100	66700	of dice rolls.
66700	71300	This one has a mix of good humor and a pretty chilling story line.
71300	73300	Hell yeah, Emma.
73300	78700	Your buddy wolf loves a set of mechanics that don't interfere with the story telling.
78700	81820	Last time the story was getting wild.
81820	83620	It's the news y'all.
83620	88820	A vocal group of the contention population are protesting and letting these officers
88820	90740	know how they feel.
90740	96820	Drew apologized to the officers for not passing along critical information like calls about
96820	102620	missing persons, animals in the ponds and creeks, and a voicemail from the feds.
102620	109540	Doug, Dr. Marie Jacobs' husband who is currently inhabiting the body of the cat Salem, showed
109540	114740	the officers the animals are hiding in the water because the oily substance cannot get
114740	117260	them in the ponds and creeks.
117260	124700	Randy Angst, dentist, estate salesman, and historical society member reveal some interesting
124700	130700	information to the officers about the picture from the odd camera John found in Julie Maxwell's
130700	134740	car as well as about Cole's orphanage.
134740	141660	In James the mill worker's house, they found a cache of guns hidden under the coffee table,
141660	147260	a bunch of cleaning supplies and random materials and a small enclave behind an oil painting
147260	153500	of a rose, a few loose tiles in the kitchen where something buried has been dragged out,
153500	159900	and a 12 foot deep pit under a trap door with two corpses and an officer Clark Bishop at
159900	160900	the bottom.
160900	166220	A heavy artillery weapon is being fired into the house from the front yard.
166220	168340	This shit is intense y'all.
168340	169780	You know what though?
169780	174720	This calls for the premiere of a brand new song here on PTPP.
174720	179060	This is Kudzu with No Backbone.
199780	215380	Okay, so Clark is stuck in the bottom of a viscerally foul smelling 12 foot deep pit
215380	221460	next to two corpses looking up at Keith and John who is lowering down one pant leg of
221460	225140	Randy Angst's shit spoiled slacks.
225140	231060	Just then, a brutally loud noise erupts from outside in the front yard and items in the
231060	233580	house begin shattering.
233580	238980	You are being fired on by some large artillery weapon.
238980	244540	Your ears are shot and your vision clouds as dust billows about the room.
244540	250900	The drywall is ripped to shreds, letting cold air and moonlight into the house.
250900	255260	I need you to roll dodge in order to run or die for cover.
255260	259740	Clark, you're actually in cover right now.
259740	261220	What's going on up there?
261220	262220	I got a...
262220	263220	I don't pass.
263220	264340	39 out of 30.
264340	266060	I do pass 42 out of 50.
266060	270180	I don't remember putting points into dodge, but I'm really happy I did.
270180	271180	Okay.
271180	274260	Success is going to gain you one D6 of cover.
274260	277460	So what are you hiding behind after you roll?
277460	278460	We'll find out.
278460	279460	Okay, yeah.
279460	280460	I got a five.
281020	286940	I'm on my way to get those shit pants, so I tumble into the bathroom and take Randy
286940	288620	Anx with me into the tub.
288620	289620	Awesome.
289620	290620	Fucking baller, dog.
290620	291620	Pantsless Randy.
291620	292620	Pantsless Randy.
292620	297860	These extremely large rounds are still going to fly through the house, so I need you both
297860	300980	to roll luck to see if you get hit.
300980	304620	15 on a 55.
304620	305620	Two on a 65.
305620	307260	Way to roll good, boy.
307260	309860	We are some lucky boys.
310260	311260	You lucky sons of guns.
311260	312260	All right.
312260	313260	I need...
313260	314260	Call my mom a bitch.
314260	315260	I need all of you to roll.
315260	316260	Take that out.
316260	317260	Take that out.
317260	318260	I love my mom.
318260	324020	Call my mom a bitch.
324020	328580	My parents were humans and not firearms.
328580	331980	I need you all to roll sanity for me.
331980	332980	Just a zero one.
332980	334980	Oh, what's my sanity at?
334980	335980	Oh, I pass.
335980	336980	Including me.
336980	338980	Including you for the fire.
338980	340980	Oh, I pass.
340980	342980	13 on a 29.
342980	345980	I got a 50 on a 20, so I don't pass.
345980	346980	Oh, no.
346980	347980	50 on a 29.
347980	348980	So I still don't pass.
348980	350660	John, you just lose one.
350660	351980	The other boys don't lose any.
351980	354540	Keith, you're going to be the only one who can see this.
354540	356180	I would tell them anyway.
356180	362540	The front door of the house flies back into the foyer like a playing card being thrown.
362540	366420	A staggering figure walks slowly through the doorway.
366460	372660	He is a looming, overweight man wearing an all-black combat uniform, and he has a large
372660	375080	scar over his right eye.
375080	380680	He holds up his left hand and you see his arm is cut off at his wrist, but there is
380680	382940	a wire attached to the nub.
382940	389100	You hear a zzzzip as the wire begins retracting into his arm and you see the front door whip
389100	390740	back into his possession.
390740	393620	He holds it up like a shield as he faces you.
393620	394620	Roll Sanity.
394620	397140	They just gave us a D&D boss.
397140	399700	We just got into Resident Evil.
399700	402620	I pass again on a 10 on a 26.
402620	406820	Okay, Keith, you just let out a shriek as you lose one sanity.
406820	411220	That was really good.
411220	413660	You take direction really well.
413660	417820	If only we had equipped ourselves with all these weapons and body armor.
417820	421700	I was just supposed to say, did we officially put them in the car?
421700	423300	We did nothing with them.
423300	425660	So they're still just on that table, right?
425660	428860	And I'm like very close to that table, right?
428860	430860	Tell me when it's my turn.
430860	431860	Keith, it's your turn.
431860	432860	What do you do?
432860	433860	I forgot what we were doing.
433860	436500	Like how far away is the table full of guns?
436500	438540	It's a move action away.
438540	439540	Okay.
439540	441180	Let me ask you this.
441180	446180	Can I pull my sidearm and shoot at him while I move to that table?
446180	447180	Yes.
447180	448180	In one move.
448180	450660	You will take a negative 20 percent.
450660	451660	On my firearms?
451660	452660	Yes.
453020	455020	I rolled a five.
455020	456020	Hell yeah.
456020	457020	Fuck yeah, dude.
457020	458020	Is it too late?
458020	460860	I guess I already rolled, so it's too late for me to do like a called shot.
460860	461860	Yeah.
461860	462860	Okay.
462860	463860	Okay.
463860	464860	Then I just shoot at him.
464860	468740	You move toward the flipped over coffee table full of guns and body armor and such as you
468740	471500	fire at this giant man.
471500	472500	Quick question.
472500	475740	I don't know if we said we should put that on or if I said I...
475740	476740	Should.
476740	477740	Okay.
477740	480740	So go ahead and roll a d10 for damage.
480740	481740	10.
481740	482740	Holy shit.
482740	483740	No, it's a...
483740	484740	It's a one.
484740	485740	Fuck.
485740	486740	It was a one.
486740	487740	God damn it.
487740	488740	Oh, wait.
488740	489740	But that was a...
489740	490740	Yeah.
490740	491740	I'll re...
491740	492740	Yeah.
492740	493740	It was a one.
493740	494740	Okay.
494740	500740	So you were firing center mass at this guy, but as you're running away...
500740	502700	Am I running away or towards him?
502700	505060	You're running away from him toward the table.
505060	506060	Okay.
506060	507060	I was thinking that it was...
507060	508060	So it's not in between us.
508060	509060	No.
509060	510060	Okay.
510380	514700	As you're running toward the coffee table, you are firing at him and you clip his arms
514700	521060	and you hear one ricochet off, but you hear another one go in, but it's not a through
521060	524160	and through and you just hear this like, okay.
524160	527220	So it's like the bullet is lodged into one of his arms.
527220	528220	Yeah.
528220	530020	As I'm running and shooting in between...
530020	531260	How many shots do I fire?
531260	532260	Three.
532260	536780	In between shots, I'm screaming mainly at John, but also to Clark.
536780	538380	Hey guys, we got company.
538380	539380	I need help.
539380	540380	John, what do you do?
540380	542180	I say, Randy, you stay right here.
542180	544740	Are there two stories or one story in this house?
544740	545740	One.
545740	546740	Okay.
546740	548380	How close is the bathroom to the back door?
548380	549380	Halfway.
549380	553540	Hey, just remember the sniper rifle is in the bathroom with you.
553540	557140	I just remembered that the sniper rifle was in the bathroom with me.
557140	558140	Sorry.
558140	562740	Randy rolls over in the bathtub and he was like laying on it.
562740	563740	Randy.
563740	566340	Randy, do you know how to use a pistol?
566340	568260	Oh yes, of course.
568260	569260	Really?
569260	570260	Did you just stay here?
570260	572540	I should probably just stay here.
572540	573540	Okay.
573540	574820	All right.
574820	576460	You stay put, buddy.
576460	578380	Contention PDs on this.
578380	583100	And I bust out the door with my pistol in one hand and like sniper rifle at my hip.
583100	586020	You're immediately looking down a hallway that looks into the foyer.
586020	587600	The foyer is the room this is all happening in?
587600	589540	The foyer is the room where this man is, yeah.
589540	590540	Can I see him?
590540	591540	Oh yeah.
591540	592540	Okay.
592540	595220	He's on the other side of the hole in the ground where Clark resides.
595220	596220	Okay.
596220	601260	So I take some cover behind the bathroom door, temporarily holster my pistol, and I'm going
601260	603060	to take a sniper rifle shot.
603060	605660	Like I'm going to line it up and try to plunk this guy in the head.
605660	609340	I don't know if that's a called shot, but I want to use the best ... I'm just going
609340	610340	to shoot him with a sniper rifle.
610340	611340	Okay.
611340	612340	Sounds good.
612340	613340	Yeah.
613340	614340	Just straight up and down.
614340	615340	Firearms roll.
615340	616340	98 on a 60.
616340	617340	98 on a 60.
617340	619700	Could have been worse.
619700	622740	You accidentally shoot yourself in the head with a firearm.
622740	627180	You shoot out the window in the front of the house that looks out on the street.
627180	628680	Clark, it's your turn.
628680	630300	How deep is this hole that I'm in?
630300	631300	12 feet.
631300	633300	How deep is this hole that I'm in?
633300	634300	How tall are you?
634300	635300	Probably six foot something.
635300	636300	Yeah.
636300	638660	Is the hole perfectly square?
638660	640460	Am I in an enclosed space?
640460	641460	Yes.
641460	642460	What are the dimensions?
642460	643460	Five by five.
643460	644460	By?
644460	645460	Five.
645460	646460	So it's-
646460	647460	No.
647460	648460	Five by five by 12.
648460	649460	Yeah.
649460	655300	He's just standing there, his head's broken up.
655300	656300	Totally exposed.
656300	657300	Guys.
657300	658300	Guys, help me.
658300	659300	He's like standing-
659300	662740	The giant guy just kicks Clark's head off.
662740	664300	Five by five by 12.
664300	668900	I got nothing, so I'm going to look through the pockets of these people down here.
668900	673060	He's just kidding.
673060	675020	Clark is becoming one of us.
675020	676020	Police work.
676020	677020	I got nothing.
677020	678780	Police work never sleeps.
678780	683100	Rifling through the pockets of these corpses, you find-
683100	684100	A ladder.
684100	685100	Sweet.
685100	688700	Go, go gadget ladder.
688700	696740	You find a piece of paper that has a circle on it, a filled in circle, and that circle
696740	700460	is surrounded by six circles.
700460	701460	I remember that.
701460	702660	I remember that too.
702660	703900	And it's hand drawn.
703900	706500	Hey, they like the faux place, just like us.
706500	707500	Fuh?
707500	708500	Yeah.
709380	711360	What is the Fuh place called?
711360	712360	The Daily Fuh.
712360	713480	The Daily Fuh.
713480	719900	This giant man in the all black combat uniform with the large scar over his right eye steps
719900	727020	forward and looks down into the pit at Clark Bishop.
727020	731740	And he holds out his other hand and he aims it at you.
731740	733580	I need you to roll dodge.
733580	737020	Is his other hand a wire thing too?
737020	739660	So far it looks like a hand with a glove on it.
739660	741220	I do not pass.
741220	743020	97 on a 50.
743020	746420	He does.
746420	750840	So he shoots straight down at you and you try to dodge out of the way and you lose five
750840	758820	damage as his hand reaches completely into your shoulder and grips.
758820	761420	Wait, did his arm stretch?
761420	768580	His fist shot off of his arm down into the pit at you and then grabbed onto your shoulder
768580	774720	where your collarbone is and then gripped into your skin and his fingers are inside
774720	778900	you as he's holding onto your shoulder.
778900	780860	His hand is still attached to his arm though?
780860	782560	Yeah, by a wire.
782560	789660	So I need you to roll unarmed combat against his in order to get this out of your shoulder.
789660	797580	His is definitely armed combat.
797580	798580	It doesn't work twice.
798580	799580	I pass.
799580	800580	25.
800580	802860	25 on a 70.
802860	804860	You're 70 unarmed combat?
804860	805860	Mm-hmm.
805860	807860	He's 72 though, right?
807860	808860	And you're rolling against him?
808860	816900	He's 70 so he has to roll higher than a 25 but under a 70 and the suspense is great as
816900	820540	Zach fiddles around the floor to find the dice that he dropped.
820540	821540	Zach.
821540	822940	Ripping his earphones out.
822940	824500	Zach, would you like some dice?
824500	825500	No!
825500	827180	Where did it go?
827180	829420	Daddy would you like some sausage?
829420	831260	Daddy would you like some sausages?
831260	833180	Joe, what did you roll?
833180	834980	25 on a 70.
834980	836860	It is staying in there.
836860	844700	The fist is locked into place and it is actually his turn again.
844700	845700	How?
845700	847820	He's got crazy decks or something.
847820	848820	Oh, I'm sorry.
848820	849820	No, it's not.
849820	850820	It's Keith's turn.
850820	851820	That's what I fucking thought.
851820	858060	Is it going to take a whole like move to grab a gun or can I grab a gun and shoot at him?
858060	859620	You can grab a gun and shoot at him.
859620	860620	Okay.
860620	861620	What's my options here?
861620	867020	You got a couple assault rifles and some heavy pistols, some light pistols.
867020	868260	Actually here's what I want to do.
868260	869260	I want to grab.
869260	873540	Is it just body armor like a bulletproof vest or tell me if I can do this.
873540	877260	I'm going to grab a bulletproof vest and a gun and hide behind the table.
877260	878580	Yeah, you can definitely do that.
878580	879580	What do I need to roll?
879580	880580	Nothing.
880580	881580	That's what I do.
881580	882580	Okay.
882580	883700	Wait, so what are my gun options here?
883700	884700	Assault rifles.
884700	886020	I don't know anything about guns.
886020	887020	Okay.
887020	888500	Grab the bulletproof vest, throw it on.
888500	894560	I grab a fully automatic assault rifle and then I duck behind the, you know, flipped
894560	896540	over table or you know, whatever it is.
896540	897540	John, what do you do?
897540	900620	I take another shot at him from behind the bathroom door.
900620	902620	Fire away.
902620	903940	91.
903940	908060	You miss opposite like you overcorrect and shoot out the window on the other side of
908060	909060	the door.
909060	910060	Getting close.
910060	911060	Clark, it's your turn.
911060	916660	I want to take my hand and do a quick wrap around the cord and use that as my repel cord
916660	918460	and walk up the wall.
918460	919460	Hell yeah.
919460	920460	Yes.
920460	925820	Legit, that's the coolest thing any of us have done in any campaign.
925820	930420	And the reason that you don't have to roll is as such.
931420	934780	That's so badass.
934780	937860	What do you do when you're teetering on the edge at the top?
937860	940920	When you say teetering, am I out of the hole?
940920	945540	I'm saying as you get, as you come out of the hole, I'm going to let you do one thing.
945540	946540	Uh, yeah.
946540	947540	I'm just going to shoot at him.
947540	948540	Describe it.
948540	949540	Uh, well, hang on.
949540	950540	Roll and then we'll, uh.
950540	951540	Hang on.
951540	952540	Yeah.
952540	953540	Hang on.
953540	954540	There's the combat ones over there too.
954540	955540	I know.
955540	956540	I know.
956540	957540	You can't roll and then do the minus 40.
957540	958540	Right.
958540	959780	Cause that's what I would have done when I got a five.
960140	964060	I'm going to do a, uh, I'm going to do a fuck.
964060	965060	I'm just going to shoot at him.
965060	971000	Um, I I'm hoping that I, he should have his, uh, yeah, I'm just shooting at him.
971000	974000	Just shooting at him full on shooting at him.
974000	977520	And I am not hitting him with a 98 on an 80.
977520	978980	The wire is slack.
978980	985600	Uh, as you make it up to the top, as he, you are firing at him, he literally just grabs
985600	990580	onto your hand and moves it away from you actually hitting him.
990580	994680	And so you're firing up at the ceiling and it's his turn.
994680	998400	I need you to roll against unarmed combat.
998400	1003480	I was going to say maybe he has some different dice.
1003480	1005420	Pass but not a great pass.
1005420	1007240	It's 21 on a 70.
1007240	1008240	That's a pretty good pass.
1008240	1009240	Okay.
1009240	1014040	Uh, he passed with a 22 on a 70.
1014040	1015040	Fuck.
1015480	1019480	Critical success.
1019480	1027280	So you actually, oh, I'm just realizing what happens now.
1027280	1036160	He retracts his hand and the wire begins zipping back into his wrist nub.
1036160	1044280	And as it does, I need you to roll a constitution, a very important constitution check.
1044280	1046860	Pass 52 on a 65.
1046860	1053680	The wire cuts through your skin as it retracts back as it's wrapped around your forearm.
1053680	1059020	It cuts all the way into your skin, but it doesn't go all the way through.
1059020	1065420	You can actually feel this wire rubbing up against your nerves on one side and your bone
1065420	1066840	on the other.
1066840	1074520	And a unfathomable pain is coursing through your entire body and you become lightheaded
1074520	1081200	as he brings you in and punches you directly in the mouth for 11 damage.
1081200	1084120	Oh man.
1084120	1085460	Your mouth was so purdy.
1085460	1088800	I'm glad I didn't touch the suit of armor.
1088800	1093840	I'm at seven hit points.
1093840	1101520	My mouth and arm.
1101520	1111040	Yeah, that's, so you are, he, he lets go of you and retracts fully, but you are on the
1111040	1112040	ground.
1112040	1113380	Keith, it is your turn.
1113380	1116360	You are hiding as this is happening to officer Bishop.
1116360	1121120	You are hiding a tactical.
1121120	1122720	I have nothing against it.
1122720	1124600	Okay, so I got a question.
1124600	1129880	Forty if partially behind cover or minus 40 I am at that point or can I stand up and like
1129880	1132640	not be, Oh yeah, that's for the opponent.
1132640	1133800	Oh, perfect.
1133800	1134800	Okay.
1134800	1136200	I need this described to me.
1136200	1140160	He's got one hand has the door as a shield.
1140160	1141240	Yep.
1141240	1142800	Clark is on the ground.
1142800	1143800	He's on the ground.
1143800	1144800	He's not being held up.
1144800	1150200	So if I do a cold shot to like just shoot at, shoot at the guy, but not, I don't necessarily
1150200	1151200	want to do a headshot.
1151200	1153160	I just want to shoot and not hit the door.
1153160	1154160	Oh yeah.
1154160	1155160	That would be a called shot.
1155160	1156160	Minus 20.
1156160	1157160	Yeah.
1157160	1158160	Fuck.
1158160	1159160	That sucks.
1159160	1161160	Cause you, you would have hit him.
1161160	1162160	I would have hit him.
1162160	1163160	Oh, that sucks.
1163160	1168680	Uh, so you are firing at him and he holds up the door and I'm also how far away from
1168680	1169680	him am I?
1169680	1170680	That's cool though.
1170680	1172480	Well, you're in the living room and he's in the foyer.
1172480	1175760	The coffee table is in the living room and you hit on the other side of it.
1175760	1178760	So you're at least 25 feet away from him.
1178760	1179760	Okay.
1180320	1181640	So I'm going to take this into consideration.
1181640	1187440	I have a fully automatic rifle and I'm shooting through a presumably wooden door.
1187440	1188440	Oh yes.
1188440	1190760	The uh, the door gets, uh, so what'd you roll?
1190760	1199640	So I rolled a 64 on a 70 minus 20 minus 20, but you cut the door in half and he is like
1199640	1201240	crouched behind it.
1201240	1207680	And as the door falls, you see him pop his head with the scar over his right eye above
1207680	1209560	the door and just stare at you.
1209560	1210840	John, what do you do?
1210840	1216040	I am aiming this turn, which will give me 20% to hit on the next turn.
1216040	1217040	Awesome.
1217040	1219440	I wish I'd read that card a turn ago.
1219440	1221360	Clark, what are you doing?
1221360	1223520	Scrambling as far away as I can.
1223520	1224520	Okay.
1224520	1228240	Probably toward John toward getting deeper into the house.
1228240	1231640	Is there anything in this game since I'm not taking a combat action that I can go even
1231640	1233280	further than I normally would be able to?
1233280	1234280	Yeah.
1234280	1235520	I would like to get really fucking far into the house.
1235520	1236520	Where do you want to go?
1236520	1237520	Maybe back.
1237520	1238520	Behind the bathroom.
1238520	1239520	Behind me.
1239520	1240520	Behind John.
1240520	1241520	Crawling like through the kitchen door.
1241520	1242520	Yeah.
1242520	1243520	Cool.
1243520	1245280	I'm still aiming, but I do like with one hand, I like help reel him in.
1245280	1246280	Nice.
1246280	1247280	Cool.
1247280	1253400	This massive dude throws down the half door that Keith just shot through and begins running
1253400	1261760	toward Keith at full speed while reaching behind him and pulling out a giant metal crowbar
1261760	1263740	from off of his back.
1263740	1271720	And he jumps and he is going to try to bring it down on Keith over through the coffee table
1271720	1273540	on the other side of it where you're hiding.
1273540	1281160	So he has a 50%, you're going to roll dodge, but you get to add 20% on it for being behind
1281160	1282160	cover.
1282160	1283160	Okay.
1283160	1284160	That gives me 60.
1284160	1285160	Fuck.
1285160	1289160	It's a crit fail.
1289560	1292560	66 on a 60.
1292560	1298320	Oh, Keith, that's a, that's a pretty big bummer.
1298320	1299320	Yeah.
1299320	1301240	Uh, it is a big bummer.
1301240	1304040	Oh my God.
1304040	1312160	Keith, this dude, you just hear this like as the floor is moving, as this giant dude
1312160	1321360	comes running toward you and then you hear quiet as a giant metal crowbar just slams
1321360	1327920	into your side and it doesn't, it doesn't poke you, but he straight up just like baseball
1327920	1332820	bat swings it into your rib cage that doing 11 damage.
1332820	1335820	That puts me at nine.
1335820	1341180	He turns his head and looks away from you and Keith, it appears that this man's face
1341200	1342700	is a mask.
1342700	1348660	You can actually, as he's been jostling himself about, you can see the glinting metal shine
1348660	1356020	from beneath as his skin sloughs off of its current placement.
1356020	1364700	So does this whole like the head skin fall off or does his face?
1364700	1367780	His whole head skin is just slightly askew.
1367780	1368780	Okay.
1368780	1370620	It's loud to one side.
1370620	1371620	Yes.
1371620	1378960	I don't know if it's realistic after taking a hit like that for you to be able to do anything
1378960	1380260	besides like get away.
1380260	1381740	Oh, it's not realistic.
1381740	1382740	It's your turn though.
1382740	1383740	And you can do anything.
1383740	1384740	Yeah.
1384740	1385740	Get this.
1385740	1386740	Get this fucker.
1386740	1392860	I mean, he used a door as a defense mechanism, so I think that he could be, you know what
1392860	1398500	I, what I do is I, so he's like standing what, like a foot away from me.
1398500	1399500	Yeah.
1399500	1400500	Don't be afraid to get creative guys.
1400500	1401500	Okay.
1401500	1403220	So what I'm going to do, can I, can I stand up?
1403220	1404460	Have we tried talking to him?
1404460	1407300	I got creative and lost an arm.
1407300	1409300	I want to stand up.
1409300	1411300	Tell me, tell me what I can do from this.
1411300	1415780	It might change my mind of what I want to do, but I want to stand up, jump on his back
1415780	1422580	since he's not facing me and use my lock picking skills to try to like, he's a, I think he's
1422580	1423580	a robot.
1423580	1426060	So I want to like unlock his head from his body.
1426060	1427420	That's fucking awesome.
1427420	1428420	Yeah.
1428420	1430100	You got creative.
1430100	1435880	So I'm going to have to have you pass two tests in order to accomplish this.
1435880	1440780	The first will be anything against his strength.
1440780	1445080	So whatever you think you're going to use to hold on or stay put is his strength on
1445080	1446080	top of him.
1446080	1447080	Can I know that or not?
1447080	1448820	I mean, no.
1448820	1449820	It's high.
1449820	1450820	Okay.
1450820	1452980	So this guy's a nerd.
1452980	1455260	You can do anything that like would make sense against that.
1455260	1456260	I guess.
1456260	1457260	Yeah.
1457260	1459820	So I mean athletics, strength, strength is my highest.
1459820	1460820	Dexterity.
1460820	1461820	I don't know.
1461820	1462820	Yes.
1462820	1463820	Okay.
1463820	1464820	I'll use decks, which is 60.
1464820	1465820	Okay.
1465820	1466820	So you're going to bear or even dodge.
1466820	1467820	Like you just got to be like six.
1467820	1469540	He's going to be my highest.
1469540	1475900	So the dice don't like us tonight.
1475900	1476900	Yeah.
1476900	1477900	You should stop using those two.
1477900	1478900	Yeah.
1478900	1483780	I'm going to do you jump onto his back and he immediately just grabbed the like grabs
1483780	1487220	you and throws you over him into the wall.
1487220	1492140	So you go flying over his back into the wall, like upside down.
1492140	1493740	You hit flat, right?
1493740	1499020	You're back against the wall and then you slide down the wall and you take four damage
1499020	1500020	guys.
1500020	1501020	I'm very close to dying.
1501020	1502020	These are good boys.
1502020	1503020	Roll with these.
1503020	1504020	John's your turn.
1504020	1505020	I want to try a couple of things.
1505020	1508300	Let me know if I can do this with my move, but I am, I'm going to move on a look real
1508300	1509300	quick clock.
1509300	1512740	You get, I give him a weary thumbs up and start to get up back to my feet.
1512740	1513820	You're just looking at your arm.
1513820	1515060	It's fucking cheese.
1515060	1516060	Okay.
1516060	1517060	I'm looking at his chair.
1517900	1518900	I'm trying not to look at his cheese arm.
1518900	1519900	Yeah.
1519900	1520900	Uh, but I see that he's okay.
1520900	1525660	I am going to run down the hallway, peek around the corner through the door that apparently
1525660	1527460	would look into the foyer and the living room.
1527460	1528460	Right.
1528460	1531300	So I'm going to level my gun at him, but I'm going to, I am going to try something we haven't
1531300	1532300	tried yet.
1532300	1533300	I'm going to shout.
1533300	1534300	Freeze.
1534300	1535300	Contention PD.
1535300	1536300	Great.
1536300	1540580	And I would like to roll a persuade.
1540580	1542180	No, I don't have to.
1542180	1543180	That's not going to work.
1543180	1544820	I mean, don't say that.
1544820	1547380	Just do it.
1547380	1550300	Go ahead and roll persuade if that's what you want to do.
1550300	1551300	No.
1551300	1552620	What I want to do is shoot him with the sniper rifle.
1552620	1553620	So yeah.
1553620	1555020	I mean, what do you want to do?
1555020	1558280	Uh, does he still get a plus 20 aim or no?
1558280	1560860	He did spend a whole turn doing it.
1560860	1561860	Boy.
1561860	1562860	That's hard.
1562860	1563860	Yeah.
1563860	1564860	That is hard.
1564860	1565860	I don't see me getting a bonus here.
1565860	1566860	Yeah.
1566860	1567860	Exactly.
1567860	1568860	I was, I was aiming.
1568860	1569860	He moved.
1569860	1570860	We would want the same courtesy to us.
1570860	1571860	Yeah.
1571860	1572860	Exactly.
1572860	1573860	Exactly.
1573900	1579540	Like if Zach was like, well, actually the MPC kid chucked up in a, and so you fucked.
1579540	1580540	We would hate that.
1580540	1585180	So yeah, I'm just going to move to where I can see him shout, freeze, contention PD.
1585180	1589340	And then before I wait for response, uh, I'm going to just blast him.
1589340	1590340	Okay.
1590340	1591540	Actually, how about trying to blast him?
1591540	1593760	He freezes.
1593760	1597900	If you pass a persuade, I will give you a plus 20 on your shot.
1597900	1598900	Ooh.
1598900	1599900	I like it.
1599900	1600900	Like I confuse them enough.
1600900	1601900	Exactly.
1601900	1602900	86.
1602940	1603940	86.
1603940	1604940	Fuck.
1604940	1605940	On a 60.
1605940	1608580	You guys remember earlier when I said we were rolling good, boys.
1608580	1609580	Sorry.
1609580	1610580	Yeah.
1610580	1611580	That stopped.
1611580	1612580	All right.
1612580	1613580	Roll that firearm straight up and down.
1613580	1615580	25 on a 60.
1615580	1616580	All right.
1616580	1618300	Two D 10 for damage.
1618300	1619300	Two D 10.
1619300	1620300	Fuck yeah.
1620300	1621300	Eight.
1621300	1622300	Eight.
1622300	1623300	Or 35.
1623300	1625300	Depending on what you want to get.
1625300	1626300	Describe it.
1626300	1627540	I see him just on instinct.
1627540	1630740	I shout that idiot shit, which obviously isn't going to stop a robot.
1630780	1632940	I'm like, freeze contention PD.
1632940	1634620	And I'm just, I'm shooting from the hip.
1634620	1640460	Like I've just got a high powered rifle in pretty close quarters and I just take a shot.
1640460	1641460	Where does it hit?
1641460	1642460	Right in his gut.
1642460	1643460	Okay.
1643460	1644460	Yeah.
1644460	1650660	And you hear this like, that satisfies John Lee Pennymore.
1650660	1651660	Clark, it's your turn.
1651660	1655060	I want to make my way to behind John again.
1655060	1656700	Can I use my good arm to shoot my pistol?
1656700	1657700	Yeah.
1657700	1662660	I want to shoot my pistol at the robot at the thing that's buzzing at this point.
1662660	1664820	Some kind of beautiful mechanical man.
1664820	1665820	Yeah.
1665820	1668100	This is the first time you guys have noticed anything weird.
1668100	1671460	I mean, outside of the arms flying off of him, that actually might've been the biggest
1671460	1672460	tip off.
1672460	1673460	Now they think about it.
1673460	1674460	The hands flying off.
1674460	1675460	Yeah.
1675460	1676460	Yeah.
1676460	1677460	And then maybe the fact that yeah, bullets didn't go through him earlier.
1677460	1678460	Okay.
1678460	1679460	So you knew he was a robot.
1679460	1680800	Also, I met a robot earlier in this campaign.
1680800	1681800	Did you?
1681800	1682800	Yeah.
1682800	1686340	Well, I met a wizard who passed me binary and I assumed he was a robot.
1686340	1691020	I'm going to pull around, get up behind John and I've got a clear sight on the...
1691020	1692020	You do indeed.
1692020	1694780	And I'm going to take a shot at the boy with my good arm.
1694780	1700780	Roll firearms and yeah.
1700780	1701780	Just roll.
1701780	1702780	I pass.
1702780	1703780	Crit pass.
1703780	1704780	Crit pass.
1704780	1707780	33 on an 80.
1707780	1708780	Okay.
1708780	1709780	Describe it.
1709780	1710780	You do 10 damage.
1710780	1711780	Hang on real fast, Keith.
1711780	1712780	You got thrown off him, right?
1712780	1713780	You're not on him anymore?
1713780	1714780	Correct.
1714780	1715780	I'm shooting at his head.
1716220	1717220	I'm on John's shoulder to steady it.
1717220	1718220	Yes.
1718220	1719220	Hell yeah.
1719220	1723420	And that gives me a real perfect line of sight on the guy's head and I pop, pop, pop, pop.
1723420	1728180	You fire your weapon into this guy's head and what happens is really fucking weird.
1728180	1733540	So each shot makes his neck snap back as his head recoils from the bullets.
1733540	1739020	His entire torso reclines fully like he's prepping to do the limbo, but his bottom half
1739020	1741660	stays completely still.
1741660	1746860	And like a spring, his body snaps back into an upright position and you see the skin drooped
1746860	1750420	over his face is covered in bullet holes.
1750420	1756940	The skin is all loose and off kilter and you can see a shiny metal where this thing's skull
1756940	1757940	should be.
1757940	1760820	Guys, we didn't ever consider it if this was a Terminator.
1760820	1761820	So send your help us.
1761820	1765260	No, I was going to make like a John Connor joke, Sarah Connor joke.
1765260	1766260	Go for it.
1766260	1767260	There's a John Connor, right?
1767260	1768260	That's your son.
1768260	1769260	Yeah, he's the other one.
1769420	1772140	Like a Schwarzenegger impression for us.
1772140	1773140	Yeah.
1773140	1779180	Hello, my name, oh boy, dude.
1779180	1780180	What was it about?
1780180	1785740	Like the, like the eighties that was like, yeah, we like buff Eastern European actors.
1785740	1789780	Well, that's just where all the buffest act, see, we as a people have always loved our
1789780	1794060	buff actors, but yeah, but like used to, it was like the buffest dudes were, and also
1794060	1795940	Austria is not Eastern European.
1795940	1798220	That is as Western European as it gets.
1798220	1801780	Well, it's on the border between the two, but it's like, so fucking German.
1801780	1805900	Well, they once ruled an empire with Hungary, which is very Eastern.
1805900	1810500	See, that was only 15 seconds of stuff that'll get edited out.
1810500	1815500	What the fucking fans come back for time and time again is these neat little tidbits that
1815500	1816580	we give them.
1816580	1824340	So the, see the thing about the Austro-Hungarian empire, so Franz Ferdinand, you take me out.
1828220	1834820	We good?
1834820	1835820	Let's keep going.
1835820	1836820	Yeah.
1836820	1842620	So you begin singing, take me out as this robot man snaps back into place and it is
1842620	1845360	now his turn.
1845360	1850900	This giant being turns and looks at Keith Vigna who is on the ground and he moves his
1850900	1855500	torso like he's going to approach Keith, but his bottom half isn't functioning.
1855500	1860420	His head begins whirring and popping little crackles and short stunted movements.
1860420	1865700	With a look of realization, the metal skull turns its attention to the two officers on
1865700	1867780	the other side of the room.
1867780	1869740	You see one of its eyes is dead.
1869740	1875780	You put a bullet right through it, but the other eye stares directly at Clark and John.
1875780	1880660	He holds out both arms and shoots his fist at the two of you.
1880660	1883100	So I need both of you to roll dodge.
1883100	1885980	18 on a 50.
1885980	1888820	64 on a 50.
1888820	1889820	I do not pass.
1889820	1892700	John Lee Pettymore didn't know what dodge meant in the skill chart.
1892700	1895780	He rolled a 50 on a 50 against John Lee Pettymore.
1895780	1898500	Oh, that means he hits me, right?
1898500	1903680	Okay, so he rolled a 50 against John Lee Pettymore and a 47 against Clark Bishop.
1903680	1909300	And so these come at you, they're coming in real hot.
1909300	1913180	Nine damage on John, three damage on Clark.
1913180	1914500	I'm at four hit points.
1914500	1915500	I'm at five.
1915500	1919740	I don't think we're going to make it to the mill today, boys.
1919740	1930400	You say as this fist completely rips into your rib cage, the fist goes right into John's
1930400	1937180	rib cage and holds on tight and you can actually feel the fist clench down and grab two of
1937180	1940220	your ribs and bring them closer together.
1940220	1941780	Oh my god.
1941780	1946100	Yeah, I would like to spend 10 points of luck to avoid that.
1946100	1947100	Oh, cool.
1947100	1950920	This is the first luck spend of the entire campaign.
1950920	1952820	What does that rule say on luck?
1952820	1957860	Spend 10 points to avoid major damage that reduces damage by 1d6.
1957860	1962640	If I get six more hit points, that would be insanely helpful to me, but even one is very
1962640	1963640	handy at this point.
1963640	1971160	All right, so John spends 10 luck putting his luck down at 45, roll that d6 to get six
1971160	1972160	hit points back.
1972160	1973160	Four.
1973160	1974160	Oh, pretty good.
1974160	1976760	He gets four hit points back, putting him at nine.
1976760	1985160	As the fist tries to reach completely in, its fingers only actually go skin deep.
1985160	1989680	It actually gets caught on a screw that was put in there from my sprint racing days and
1989680	1993080	jammed and it can't bring my ribs together like it wants to.
1994080	2002640	And the claw actually grabs onto the forearm that had been recently shredded on Clark.
2002640	2008480	Just pushing that nerve right up against the bone and the two are rubbing against each
2008480	2009480	other.
2009480	2011480	Uh, go ahead and nevermind.
2011480	2012480	Nevermind.
2012480	2013480	You're dead.
2013480	2014480	You're dead.
2014480	2015480	Fuck you.
2015480	2016480	You're dead.
2016600	2023920	So now I need you guys to both roll against his unarmed combat to try to get out of this
2023920	2024920	grapple.
2024920	2029680	Okay, the baseline unarmed combat status, 40% if you don't modify it at all, which I
2029680	2030680	have not.
2030680	2031680	58.
2031680	2032680	I don't pass.
2032680	2036920	67 on a 70.
2036920	2038320	That's a great fucking roll.
2038320	2039320	Hell yeah, dude.
2039320	2040320	It is indeed.
2040320	2043200	And you actually win your roll.
2043200	2044200	Fuck yeah.
2044200	2046040	He passed against Clark with an eight.
2046040	2049440	So John, your fist is staying in.
2049440	2052080	It's hooked on that screw.
2052080	2058000	And Clark, describe how you get this, uh, this inspector gadget go-go fist off of your
2058000	2059000	forearm.
2059000	2061840	I use my gun to pry off the fingers.
2061840	2063840	Tink, tink, tink.
2063840	2064840	Ooh, badass.
2064840	2068560	Yeah, that's very cool.
2068560	2070040	And it is Keith's turn.
2070040	2076160	Is there any way I could roll luck to see if this body armor that I put on might have
2076160	2077680	a knife in it?
2077680	2079480	You have a knife on you already.
2079480	2082120	Oh yeah, can I see if there was a bazooka in my pants?
2082120	2083120	Wait.
2083120	2084120	Well, no, I don't.
2084120	2085120	Well, I do have a knife on me already.
2085120	2087280	I would imagine that you have a knife.
2087280	2089960	You live in the country, you're a police officer, I'd imagine you have a knife on you.
2089960	2092320	Okay, so can I describe the knife I have on me?
2092320	2095480	You can describe a pretty common knife that you would have on you.
2095480	2097040	I want to describe like a...
2097040	2098800	That Gipu being a knife guy.
2098800	2103600	I've got a four foot long knife.
2103600	2106160	I mean, some people might call it a sword, but yeah.
2106160	2107840	I'm not going to go that far, but hold on.
2107840	2115280	I take the broadsword off my back and with both hands more like a scythe, I take my spear.
2115280	2116520	I know what I want to do.
2116520	2118520	Let me describe it.
2118520	2124880	So I pull out, it's like a pocket knife in the sense that it folds into itself, but I
2124880	2127400	pull it out and it's like a four inch blade.
2127400	2135080	I want to get up off of the ground and run with my knife and just chop the wires that
2135080	2141680	are connecting his hands to these people and just cut the wires and then just like run
2141680	2142680	through.
2142680	2143680	Okay, awesome.
2143680	2148980	If you're going to do it to both of them, I'm going to do a negative 20 on both rolls.
2148980	2152480	Not to be super selfish, but he is only embedded in me right now.
2152480	2154040	So if you did one of them.
2154040	2155040	Well, that's true.
2155500	2160080	Would you give me a negative 20 on the second one and a regular one on the first one?
2160080	2162100	I'll give you a negative 40 on the second one.
2162100	2163320	And a regular on the first one?
2163320	2164320	I like that.
2164320	2165320	Yeah.
2165320	2166800	So what's the first one is connected.
2166800	2168920	Did you know you can barter with your...
2168920	2170400	Who's connected?
2170400	2171400	You?
2171400	2172400	Yeah.
2172400	2175800	I mean, honestly there's only one wire like connected the other wire.
2175800	2176800	Okay.
2176800	2177800	Then I'll just do the only taught wire.
2177800	2178800	Yeah.
2178800	2179800	Okay.
2179800	2180800	Let's take this back.
2180800	2181800	Yeah.
2181800	2182800	Hold on.
2182800	2183800	So I pull out my knife.
2183800	2188600	I'm going to use my orange blade pocket knife and I'm going to run and just try to cut the
2188600	2190680	wire that's connected to John.
2190680	2191680	Okay.
2191680	2192680	And that's going to be a strength roll.
2192680	2193680	Roll a strength roll.
2193680	2197680	That's a crit success.
2197680	2199840	11 on a 50 fuck.
2199840	2201360	Fuck yes.
2201360	2203680	This makes me very happy.
2203680	2204680	And I'll tell you why.
2204680	2205680	Oh no.
2205680	2206680	No.
2206680	2209680	Not for any devious reasons.
2209680	2210680	Anytime.
2210680	2211680	Zach is happy.
2211680	2219200	No, it is because I was going to have to be a stick in the mud DM who is like, actually
2219200	2223000	that wire is made from a very strong.
2223000	2227720	So only a critical success could actually cut through it, which you did.
2227720	2232000	Are we peeking hard?
2232000	2233000	Yeah.
2233000	2234000	Oh yeah.
2234000	2235000	Every time we cheer.
2235000	2236000	So how do we fix that?
2236000	2237000	Let's cheer away.
2237000	2241120	All clear.
2241120	2242120	John is no longer grappled.
2242120	2244160	Let me fucking describe it, dude.
2244160	2245160	Oh, sorry.
2245160	2246640	Do it.
2246640	2249080	So I get up off the ground.
2249080	2250760	I like collect myself.
2250760	2254240	My back hurts really bad and I look and see what just happened.
2254240	2260000	I pull this pocket knife that you could barely call a pocket knife out of my back pocket.
2260000	2267680	I flipped the blade up and it's like three inches wide, four inches tall.
2267680	2274480	And I hold it with both of my fists out in front of me.
2274480	2281240	And I run as fast as I can, arms wide out in front of me and just run into this wire.
2281240	2289240	You just run straight and use it like a lightsaber or a simple machine.
2289240	2292360	And I run through it and it cuts through it like butter.
2292360	2301400	And as I do it, I look into the one eye of this monster and I flip it off.
2301400	2307120	And then I, as soon as I hit the wire, obviously like tension comes and it kind of like throws
2307120	2308120	me off.
2308120	2309120	It cuts through the wire.
2309120	2315560	I fall down and roll and I roll and I get back up and just two fingers, two middle fingers
2315560	2316840	up to this robot.
2316840	2317840	Hell yeah.
2317840	2318840	John turn.
2318840	2319840	John turn.
2319840	2320840	John, it's your turn.
2320840	2321840	John turn.
2322320	2328080	Can you imagine as I get released from this thing's clutches that I probably in pain,
2328080	2331480	like at least fall on a knee to the ground?
2331480	2332480	Absolutely.
2332480	2335800	Uh, because it did pull you forward as the tension.
2335800	2336800	Okay.
2336800	2339080	So I'm in the foyer now a little bit.
2339080	2340080	A little bit.
2340080	2341080	Yeah.
2341080	2342920	Uh, he's still in the living room.
2342920	2344440	He is indeed.
2344440	2350300	And the fist is still clenched around my, okay.
2350300	2351300	In your body.
2351780	2352780	Ouchies.
2352780	2353780	Ouchie mama.
2353780	2356700	Well, I don't have time to worry about that.
2356700	2360700	I am going to, I'm just going to try to shoot from the hip with a sniper rifle again.
2360700	2362920	That does do more damage than my sidearm, right?
2362920	2363920	It does indeed.
2363920	2369260	And it doesn't even matter cause it's the same, but yeah, uh, same firearms go 37.
2369260	2370500	I finally pass.
2370500	2374380	Roll two D 10 for damage, uh, eight.
2374380	2375380	Cobains.
2375380	2376380	Describe it.
2376380	2377960	So I fall into my knees.
2377960	2381920	I guess he's still in front of me because he shot at us from inside that room.
2381920	2382920	So I'm in pain.
2382920	2387760	I'm clutching at my side, but I bring the sniper rifle up from the hip and I just try
2387760	2390080	to shoot him kind of in the gut again.
2390080	2391080	Awesome.
2391080	2399560	Firing through his, his midsection, you get two shots just right through his gut.
2399560	2400560	That's the sound of sniper.
2400560	2401560	That's a good one.
2401560	2402560	That's good.
2402560	2403560	And a foyer.
2403560	2414160	It's like
2414160	2418000	as like the inside of him is just going crazy.
2418000	2423600	There are wires flying out of his midsection and his head is just kind of like shaking
2423600	2427500	back and forth and it's really weird.
2427500	2435820	You probably wouldn't notice it if you weren't peeking so fucking hard on Coke right now,
2435820	2445500	but you actually see this guy, his face grimace and his teeth clench.
2445500	2448220	I shout, Hey guys, it can feel pain.
2448220	2451860	And then I also say, take that weird science.
2451860	2452860	Perfect.
2452860	2455460	Clark, it's your turn.
2455460	2456460	Finish him.
2457420	2458420	I want to shoot.
2458420	2459420	I want to shoot at it.
2459420	2460420	Do it.
2460420	2461420	Nope.
2461420	2464420	I do not pass.
2464420	2466420	98 on an 80.
2466420	2467420	98?
2467420	2468420	A couple 98s.
2468420	2469420	Yeah.
2469420	2470420	We might need some different stones.
2470420	2471420	Hey, try those.
2471420	2472420	Try those.
2472420	2473420	They spit hot fire.
2473420	2474420	Oh, darn.
2474420	2475420	I got to go buy more dice.
2475420	2476420	Oh shit.
2476420	2477420	Do you want to buy dice tomorrow?
2477420	2480860	Cause it's been a minute for me.
2480860	2482420	Maybe you need different stats.
2482420	2483420	Oh,
2484380	2488380	Fucking burn dude.
2488380	2490380	Come on man.
2490380	2491380	Fucking burn.
2491380	2492380	What the fuck dude.
2492380	2500020	Maybe before you buy a new dice you should check your decks.
2500020	2505940	It is the shiny headed robot man's turn and he sets his sights on the meat boy that just
2505940	2508020	cut off one of his hand wires.
2508020	2513300	So I need a strength roll from Keith or an unarmed combat check, whichever one's higher.
2514180	2515180	I did strength, which is 55.
2515180	2516180	I got a 34.
2516180	2518660	You were doing 55 in the 34.
2518660	2531060	You lose the opposed contest that you were in with this man as you lose the torso of
2531060	2547780	this being becomes unattached from the legs beneath it and a small jet pack begins shooting
2547780	2556340	flames, begins shooting flames from the bottom of the torso as it runs, as it runs, as it
2556340	2564220	flies towards Keith, it reaches down, zips back into one decent hand, grabbing you by
2564220	2573180	the throat and flying you out the window of the living room into the front yard.
2573180	2580160	I need you to roll an extremely important strength or unarmed combat contest.
2580160	2586040	As you fly through the window, you have a chance to break free from this robot.
2586040	2592680	19 out of 55, but also that's a competition, so maybe not so good.
2592680	2593680	That sucks.
2593680	2594680	I hate that.
2594680	2595680	I'll roll it in front of you guys.
2595680	2598960	He has a 70.
2598960	2599960	He fails.
2599960	2604080	You just cartoonishly clutch.
2604080	2605680	You rolled a 94.
2605680	2607160	94 on a 70.
2607160	2608320	He grabs you by the throat.
2608320	2611620	He grabs you by the throat and as you bust through the window.
2611620	2616640	I bite into his mechanical hand.
2616640	2617640	Shatter your teeth.
2617640	2620520	Two of my teeth break off.
2620520	2621520	Which two?
2621520	2622520	Now you're from contention.
2622520	2623520	These two right here.
2623520	2624520	Okay, cool.
2624520	2625520	Describe them.
2625520	2626520	It's an audio podcast.
2626520	2631820	My canine and the one next to it going to the middle, I don't know what that one's called,
2631820	2638560	break off and I realize, oh, I can't bite a machine and so I just poke my finger into
2638560	2643460	his one good eye.
2643460	2650420	As you do that, the robot man releases you and you fall into the front yard as the robot
2650420	2656220	flies up towards the sky and explodes in a firework-like explosion.
2656220	2658620	Holy shit, good work guys.
2658620	2661060	You just had to poke it in the eye the whole time.
2661900	2663300	Let's try that with all the enemies from now on.
2663300	2669460	I land on my back, breath gets knocked out of me, but I look up as he's exploding and
2669460	2678020	I put my hand up to my forehead and I salute and I go, skyrockets in flight, baby.
2691060	2710980	How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
