0	4300	Welcome. Please enter my future listeners.
4300	15900	It's your new obsession, Wolf the Dog, and I'm crawling deeper and deeper into your ear holes from 694.2 PTBP,
15900	23900	the newest, best, and only radio station in a very real town called Contention.
23900	27400	Tune in to our hit show, Pretended to be People,
27400	30700	to hear three bumbling police officers.
30700	31800	Keith Vigna,
31800	35300	I'm not a bad cop, I'm just a bad cop.
35300	37400	John Lee Pettymore IV,
37400	39300	I fire my pistol into the air.
39300	41000	and Clark Bishop,
41000	43200	Can we call the president?
43200	51400	as they struggle against their own incompetence in a futile attempt to save their small town from an ineffable threat.
51400	64500	The limp bodies, after sliding into a pool of their own blood, are picked up and slammed into the ground repeatedly and at an absurd rate by some unseen force.
64500	70300	And then, as if they were never there at all, both bodies are gone.
70300	74300	All while navigating some unique citizens.
74300	76800	A cold chill runs down Clark's spine.
76800	78400	It's a fucking cat man!
78400	80600	Surreal horror.
80600	83800	It was somebody who knew I watched Wheel of Fortune every night.
83800	86700	And gruesome crime scenes.
86700	89900	The skin on her back was branded with the phrase,
89900	91600	This is a fool.
91600	94600	And the cause of death was blunt trauma.
94600	95800	Hell yeah, dude.
98700	106500	Keep in mind, Pretending to be People is available wherever you listen to podcasts.
106500	109100	So come on down to Contention.
109100	120700	Join your new grown-ass man-pet-friend-narrator DJ Wolf the Dog in this greasy dumpster filled with deliciously wet nibbles.
120700	124200	And enjoy Pretending to be People.
139100	144000	Thanks for watching!
