0	7000	Welcome, my slimy babies, to the greasiest radio show ever howled out of jowls.
7000	12500	It's your big-time, crime-loving, slime-daddy wolf, the dog.
12500	22000	I like to cover myself in my own saliva constantly to protect myself from the powers of other dimensional beings.
22000	25300	And cause I think it smells just right,
25300	42800	I am slipping and sliding at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the slimiest, grimiest, bad-rimeiest radio station this side of the Great Atlantic Salt Lake.
42800	47800	Did y'all know that there's a thing this old wolfie would love for you to do right now?
47800	53300	Well, there is. Write a five-star review of this show on Apple Podcasts.
53300	57300	Ah, are you on a computer or an an-deroid?
57300	62800	Before you boo-hoo, look around you. Someone is using an iPhone.
62800	67800	Ask if you can review the show on their phone, if they ask why I tell them.
67800	76300	And maybe I'll read your review, like I'm about to read this one here from D-Town Pods entitled, only about halfway through.
76300	78300	D-Town Pods writes,
107300	112800	The only phone I know how to operate is the old-timey rotary ones.
112800	116800	I like sticking my finger in them and never pulling out.
116800	119300	Hard to reach folks that way, though.
119300	124800	I just rely on the way that my voice can penetrate all dimensions and times.
124800	126800	Can't everyone do that, too?
126800	129800	But, uh, thanks for the compliment, D-Town.
129800	135800	But I'd appreciate it if more of these reviews talked a little bit more about little old me.
135800	138300	I'm starting to feel unloved.
138300	141300	Well, there's time for love-making.
141300	143300	Then there's time for news-making.
143300	145300	It is the news right now.
145300	154800	Last time, Pastor Adam Kane showed up on the four-wheeler with the radio and Agent Trent Chad in the body of Salem the Cat.
154800	157300	Fucking sick, am I right?
157300	166800	Also, Casey Kristoff was, and still is, holding Carrie Page's hostage with a pistol aimed at the back of her head.
166800	168300	She hollered out,
168300	175300	Bubblegum tree to the boys, confirming their identity as the beautiful soul of Drew Andrews.
175300	184300	Unfortunately for these boys, though, Keith Vigna tripped and slid face-first down into the muddy basin that was once Bean's Pond.
184300	190800	Though he did pop up in time to shatter one of the glass tubes on the odd-looking radio.
190800	200300	However, that was the last move taken before Pastor Adam Kane smashed a residue-filled fish onto his strange helmet.
200300	207300	Greenlighting the greenlight and sending the three PCs into a reality of their deepest regrets.
207300	216300	When they came to, Agent Trent Cat had disarmed John Lee Pettymore, Clark Bishop was about to trip into the mud bowl,
216300	224300	and Keith Vigna was being dragged by Daddy Kane toward the impassable metal plate, which began to slide open.
224300	232300	I swear to me, we better find out what's behind this fucking door before I premiere next week's brand new track,
232300	238300	which most assuredly will not be Kudzu With No Backbone.
262300	276300	Luke's internet sucks, the world sucks, the world's always sucks, but what doesn't sucks, what doesn't sucks is hanging out with my friends and playing like we're other people.
276300	277300	It doesn't sucks.
277300	278300	It's nice, actually.
278300	281300	Let's get right into it. Clark Bishop, it's your turn, what do you do?
281300	284300	Hold on, let me, uh, can I share my screen real quick?
284300	286300	Jesus fucking Christ.
286300	292300	That is not what I expected to happen.
292300	296300	But it should have been.
296300	301300	Do you have the ability to? I guess is a question I should ask. Have I given you the ability to?
301300	303300	Host disabled participant screen sharing.
303300	306300	Oh, actually Joe Terry is the host, because I love Joe Terry.
306300	307300	Oh, right.
307300	311300	So we ain't gonna see shit.
311300	318300	Alright, Clark Bishop, it's your turn, what do you do?
318300	320300	That's really not that important, so.
320300	321300	We didn't think it was.
321300	329300	No shit.
329300	335300	I know you were excited to see what it was and probably learn something, but.
335300	338300	I think, I think it's open now.
338300	339300	Okay, good.
339300	343300	I swear to God, if it's a top list, if it's a top ten list from classicrock.com.
343300	347300	Nope, it's just lots of this.
347300	349300	Is it normal to pee and poop at the same time?
349300	351300	It's so much worse than I-
351300	354300	Well, no, what he Googled was poopy.
354300	357300	No, I Googled pee and poop at the same time.
357300	358300	Oh, okay, gotcha.
358300	360300	Pee and poop at the same time.
360300	361300	Yeah.
361300	362300	Is what we're getting here.
362300	366300	Hey, you have four messages in your Reddit inbox, why don't you go look at those?
366300	369300	It's all like trending on.
369300	371300	Why don't you look at those right now?
371300	372300	This is very slow.
372300	375300	Yeah, we might be tempting fate by having you loaded.
375300	376300	Yeah, let's just get back to it.
376300	377300	It's so true, why are we doing this?
377300	378300	Oh, yeah.
378300	379300	Yeah.
379300	382300	Loop's internet has been crabbing out for the past, what, hour and 45 minutes while
382300	384300	we've been trying to record?
384300	385300	Yeah.
385300	386300	Yeah, like three months.
386300	387300	Oh, guys.
387300	389300	Yeah, yeah, ever since.
389300	390300	Forever.
390300	391300	Oh, boy.
391300	392300	Okay.
393300	397300	More fun than this was recording in person and hanging out with friends.
397300	400300	Dude, I wish we could do that.
400300	402300	All right, Clark Bishop, it is your turn.
402300	403300	What do you do?
403300	405300	Do you remember what happened to me last time?
405300	406300	Of course I do.
406300	407300	I was running the game.
407300	411300	You came back to reality and you were looking across this.
411300	412300	Oh, there goes gravity.
412300	413300	Oh, there goes gravity.
413300	418300	He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy is what Casey Kristoff seems to be saying
418300	421300	with the gun that's still pointed in the back of Perry Page's head.
421300	426300	There's spaghetti nowhere, as far as you can tell, but the muddy basin that was Bean's
426300	431300	Pond does kind of look like a spaghetti bowl that has been finished, but the sauce is still
431300	437300	kind of hanging out in the bottom of the bowl as it is filled with a liquid soil.
437300	438300	So.
438300	439300	Mud.
439300	440300	Did we get there?
440300	446300	And then also, Agent Shrink Cat is on the ground next to John Lee Pettymore the Thirth
446300	453300	with the gun that John was just holding and the clip is like out the magazine.
453300	456300	Did I roll to contest that?
456300	457300	Trying to get it out.
457300	458300	Well, no.
458300	461300	See, you weren't in this reality for two rounds.
461300	466300	In the first round, the cat made it up the hill and then the second round rolled an ought
466300	467300	one.
467300	468300	Smart move, cat.
468300	469300	Yeah.
469300	471300	That was that ought one was for last time.
471300	475300	You should stop using your one dice.
475300	477300	It's true.
477300	480300	It hardly seems fair.
480300	484300	It's just a ping pong ball with the one written on it.
484300	487300	This is it.
487300	494300	Oh, and also, Keith Bigna is being dragged in a half nelson toward the impassable metal
494300	500300	plate on the ground in the middle of this muddy basin and that metal plate, aka the
500300	506300	door at Bean's Pond that you've been making your way toward, basically, this entire arc,
506300	510300	is opening as he approaches.
510300	515300	I was mostly getting at during my secret time, I rolled over my power, so I had to physically
515300	517300	move to go do something.
517300	519300	Did I end up somewhere different in this world?
519300	520300	Oh, yeah, that's fun.
520300	523300	Roll a dexterity check right off the bat.
523300	528300	You're still going to have to act out what you were doing there, but if you fail this
528300	532300	dexterity roll, you will fall down into the muddy basin.
532300	533300	I pass.
533300	540300	Okay, then you are teetering on the edge, and your toes curl over within the shoes,
540300	547300	and the mud slips out from underneath you, but you can gain enough balance to stay atop
547300	551300	on the edge of this, what would you call that?
551300	552300	Precipice.
552300	553300	Oh!
553300	554300	Nice.
554300	556300	Precipice and poo at the same time.
556300	559300	Clark Bishop, what do you do?
559300	562300	I guess I'm keeping the intro.
562300	565300	Keith is being dragged into the now open door.
565300	568300	Do I still have my shot lined up on Adam?
568300	573300	You wouldn't get the plus 20 bonus because you were looking at a different world.
573300	574300	Okay.
574300	576300	And Adam is the one showing me a Ryan Gosling movie?
576300	577300	That is correct.
577300	580300	He's your teacher in an inner-city school.
580300	583300	Sweet.
583300	585300	I think I want to take a shot at him.
585300	586300	Okay.
586300	587300	Don't hit me, please.
587300	589300	That's my only debate.
589300	591300	Do I maybe say something first?
591300	597300	We all watched Hamilton this weekend, so we know you're not going to miss your shot.
597300	601300	All right, so are you going to throw away your shot, or are you going to take a shot?
601300	604300	I'm not going to throw away my shot.
604300	605300	I'm taking a shot at Adam.
605300	609300	I knew I was getting it wrong.
609300	611300	I was going to let it happen, but then I decided not to.
611300	617300	You're at a negative 20 for firearms in order to not hit Keith Vigna unless you want to roll at a normal,
617300	621300	and then I'll roll a chance that you hit him.
621300	623300	Did that make any sense?
623300	624300	I don't know.
624300	626300	That didn't make sense to me, so I'll start over.
626300	629300	I'm just like my country. I'm young, friendly, and horny.
629300	636300	That's right, right?
636300	638300	And I'm not going to throw away my shot.
638300	646300	I'm young, friendly, and full of cum.
646300	649300	That was the first draft.
649300	651300	He revised that one.
651300	654300	He's playing it. Lin-Manuel's playing it for the Obamas.
654300	657300	So what do you think?
657300	661300	Michelle's like, I have one note.
661300	667300	All right, I'm taking a negative 20. That puts my firearms at 60. Here we go.
667300	670300	I do not pass. It's a 91.
670300	671300	Shoot.
671300	680300	As soon as you fire, it releases a held action, which means that in combat someone can decide during their turn
680300	688300	that as soon as this thing happens, I will take my action, and you immediately hear a gunshot ring out.
689300	694300	And you see the gun at the back of Kerry Page's head.
694300	695300	No.
695300	707300	And the hand holding that gun fucking explodes, and there's just a nub on the end of this forearm of Casey Kristoff
707300	711300	as he screams like, oh, hey, dude, not me. Oh, shit, man.
711300	712300	Holy shit.
712300	719300	As the man falls to the ground, Drew Kerry, Kerry Page's inside out, whatever the fuck you want to call Kerry Andrews,
719300	724300	gets up and just fucking elbows him right in the face and grabs the gun.
724300	726300	Bubble gum tree.
726300	727300	Yes, dude.
727300	728300	Bubble gum tree.
728300	729300	Bubble gum tree.
729300	734300	You do not know where this shot was fired from, and it is John Lee Pettymore the third's turn.
734300	735300	Oh, my God.
735300	740300	Yeah, I'd like to overpower the cat to get my ammo back.
740300	747300	John, when you look down at this cat, it is looking at you with both fear and necessity and want.
747300	751300	Since it's an FBI agent in a cat's body, can I persuade it?
751300	752300	Absolutely.
752300	757300	It's just trying to get this clip away from you, and so it's with its mouth, and then with its paw,
757300	761300	it's trying to move your gun through the mud.
761300	765300	I hold my hand out palm first. Hold on there.
765300	768300	Listen, you're in law enforcement.
768300	773300	I was what I once was once might have been considered law enforcement.
773300	778300	Now, Adam Kane over there probably told you he could get your body back.
778300	784300	But really, he just wants to open a portal to the past and fuck everything else and, like, take it for himself.
784300	786300	The whole world.
786300	787300	That's my working theory.
787300	794300	So if you give me that ammo back, I can stop them and I can help you get your body, which totally still exists.
795300	796300	Roll persuade.
796300	798300	Does his body exist?
798300	799300	I don't remember.
799300	800300	Totally.
801300	804300	I mean, depending on the time of day, it might still be around.
804300	805300	Fuck!
805300	807300	Oh, that's a really good point.
807300	808300	73 on a 60.
808300	811300	What happened to his body? I don't remember.
811300	813300	He was killed in the fish tank room.
813300	815300	Oh, okay. That's right.
815300	817300	Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad.
817300	818300	Yeah.
818300	827300	This cat continues to back away from you and immediately with one of its paws begins filling the bottom of your pistol with mud.
827300	832300	So where the magazine would normally go, it's throwing dirt and mud and rocks in there.
832300	835300	This guy doesn't know anything about guns. Bullets go there.
839300	843300	I thought you were talking about me and I was like, oh, could he still fire like that?
843300	845300	I don't believe so.
846300	848300	It's just mud bullets then, yeah.
848300	852300	You can shoot anything out of a gun if you put it in the bottom of it.
854300	861300	Keith Vigna, you're being dragged backwards through the mud by Pastor Adam Kane in a Ryan Gosling film.
861300	862300	Hold.
862300	867300	Okay, quick question. So one of my arms is up like this, I guess?
867300	871300	He's got you underneath your arms with his palms on the back of your neck.
871300	873300	That'd be a full Nelson, right?
873300	874300	Oh, sorry.
874300	877300	Then twice a Ryan Gosling.
877300	879300	Okay, so it is a full Nelson.
879300	880300	Yeah, he's got you in a full Nelson.
880300	885300	I'm just going to try to drop dead weight and try to flip him over me.
885300	892300	Okay, sounds good. Roll unarmed combat against Pastor Adam Kane who succeeds with a 37 on a 40.
892300	893300	God damn it.
893300	898300	He is grabbing his camera and he is showing us an 88.
902300	903300	Yay.
904300	926300	You drop dead weight and a strength that only comes from a man who is getting revenge for the death of his entire family comes through Pastor Adam Kane as he lifts you completely up off the ground and gripping somehow through this mud, he just dives backwards into the square hole.
926300	927300	Oh, no.
927300	928300	Oh, fuck.
928300	940300	Into whatever is past this door and Keith, you see a square of light ahead of you as you fall.
940300	944300	You guys hear, this won't bring your family back.
944300	949300	And then you all hear a thump and the door begins closing.
949300	963300	And when I say the door is closing, it is this metal plate that has slid completely parallel to the ground, horizontal if you will, and it is now sliding back the other way shut.
963300	965300	Indiana Jones, this shit.
965300	967300	That might be the only way.
967300	974300	And with that is Pastor Adam Kane's turn and I need Thomas and Joe to take their headphones off.
974300	976300	Don't kill me.
979300	993300	Luke, you see this light above you as you land with a thud on top of Pastor Adam Kane.
993300	1000300	Your back lands on him and he hits his head and gets knocked out.
1000300	1001300	Straight up.
1001300	1003300	Yes.
1003300	1006300	Is it lit other than the light from the hole?
1006300	1009300	The only thing is the light from above.
1009300	1014300	And you're just in there, it's basically concrete, four concrete walls with a concrete floor.
1014300	1024300	And on one of the walls, you see that there is a circle that is made of like the same metal that the door was made out of.
1024300	1025300	Just a circle.
1025300	1026300	Yep, just a circle.
1026300	1028300	Just like there was a square above you.
1028300	1029300	Oh, okay.
1029300	1034300	Yeah, it looks like an impassable metal plate, but it's a big circle instead of a big square.
1034300	1036300	Go first, take two damage from the fall.
1036300	1037300	How many hit points did you have?
1037300	1041300	I have ten and, well, I had ten, now I have eight.
1041300	1042300	Oh shit, dude.
1042300	1043300	Yeah.
1043300	1047300	Okay, I see that he's knocked out.
1047300	1049300	Can I search him for any weapons?
1049300	1053300	Yeah, he doesn't have any weapons on him, he just is wearing this helmet.
1053300	1060300	And when you're kind of like searching all over him, he really, he didn't have a weapon on him.
1060300	1068300	But this helmet, the light is neither red nor green, and you see that the back, there's some glass.
1068300	1069300	And it's shattered.
1069300	1072300	The tubes have shattered as he fell.
1072300	1076300	Okay, I want to take that off of him and put it on myself.
1076300	1078300	I want to approach the circle.
1078300	1080300	There's nothing on it, no writing or anything?
1080300	1081300	No writing, no nothing.
1081300	1083300	I just want to put my hand on it.
1091300	1096300	Casey Kristoff screams, oh man, oh no.
1096300	1104300	And immediately gets on his knees and puts his one hand and one forearm up in the air.
1104300	1107300	And Kerry Pages gets behind him.
1107300	1112300	Okay, now that the roles have been reversed, you will do the same as I did, which was nothing.
1112300	1113300	Please do not move.
1113300	1115300	Clark Bishop, it is your turn.
1115300	1122300	I want to be running toward the door, but scanning the perimeter for the other shooter.
1122300	1127300	Okay, so do first a dexterity or athletics at a negative 20?
1129300	1133300	I'm doing decks and I fail.
1133300	1134300	Yeah, I fail.
1134300	1140300	As you're like running down the hill, there's just too much bounce in trying to like keep your balance.
1140300	1146300	You're not going to be able to roll search or alertness to try to see where the shot was coming from.
1146300	1154300	And as you're going down, you trip on a rock and you kind of slip, do one of those banana peel slips,
1154300	1162300	and you fall right on your ass and mud begins piling up as you're sliding down in your crotch area.
1163300	1166300	Do you know how mud might do that?
1166300	1169300	This is the worst time to look so uncool.
1169300	1172300	I know, you look very silly.
1173300	1178300	And you got brown crotch, it's just all muddy down there.
1181300	1182300	Yeah, okay.
1182300	1183300	Good turn.
1183300	1184300	John Lee Pettymore, what do you do?
1184300	1185300	That's great.
1189300	1191300	And you shit your pants and you pee a little.
1192300	1196300	Everybody starts screaming at you, holy shit Clark, did you shit your pants?
1197300	1200300	The whole town of contention is somehow back alive and watching.
1201300	1203300	They're all holding hands.
1203300	1206300	This wasn't the actual reality, they're all watching you.
1206300	1210300	You see your parents standing before you and they were pointing.
1211300	1213300	Hands around Bean's pond.
1213300	1220300	So John is being a good midwesterner and he's both averting his eyes from Clark,
1220300	1224300	but also just mouthing like, oh my God.
1226300	1228300	As he's just running for the door.
1229300	1230300	Okay.
1230300	1232300	Give me a dexterity or athletics.
1233300	1235300	50 on a 55 dex.
1235300	1236300	Nice.
1236300	1238300	50 on a 55 dex.
1238300	1239300	Anything else?
1239300	1243300	No, he's really trying not to look at Clark.
1246300	1248300	Thanks for not looking at me, John.
1250300	1257300	You make it to the metal door as it completes its closure.
1257300	1264300	And as soon as you get there, you slide up in this mud to once again an impassable metal plate.
1264300	1267300	A metal door buried in the ground.
1267300	1269300	A critical success would have gotten you there.
1269300	1275300	That or trying to put something in it to Indiana Jones it were your only options.
1275300	1278300	That's the kind of game do you want to play here, Zach?
1280300	1282300	I have it written in my notes.
1283300	1287300	That we can only critical success or Indiana Jones it?
1288300	1291300	It literally says it slides into a metal door.
1291300	1292300	Indiana Jones it?
1292300	1298300	It literally says it slides shut during that round and they have to crit or do something cool to get in.
1298300	1299300	Nice.
1299300	1300300	So essentially, yeah.
1300300	1302300	I did something cool. I helped out a friend.
1306300	1308300	I was modest, dammit.
1310300	1311300	Okay.
1311300	1314300	Can I start pawing at this door in front of me?
1314300	1315300	Yeah, you can.
1315300	1327300	And then pawing at the mud behind you is Agent Trent Catt, which has followed you down into the basin and is now at the radio and is on top of it.
1327300	1333300	I slam my fist on the door in the mud and say, why, Keith, why?
1337300	1338300	Okay, so you're?
1338300	1342300	I'm pounding on the door and I'm screaming Adrian and not looking at Joe.
1345300	1353300	Hey, look, a bar.
1353300	1354300	Hello.
1354300	1355300	Hello.
1355300	1362300	I was reading about Seth Putnam as soon as I don't know who that is.
1362300	1365300	He's the lead singer of Anal Cunt.
1365300	1366300	Okay.
1366300	1379300	So as you're in this room, you put your hand up against this circular metal plate on the wall and the door above you finishes closing.
1379300	1388300	And then as soon as it's finished closing, you hear banging from above and you hear John Lee Pettymore the Thirth screaming.
1388300	1390300	Why, Keith, why?
1390300	1395300	Dammit, Keith, I'm sorry, we couldn't get to you or something like that.
1395300	1403300	I wish that I could have helped aid you on your role that you failed, I assume.
1403300	1405300	Or you could have tried harder.
1405300	1407300	Yes, he could have tried harder is what I.
1407300	1409300	Would he be able to hear me if I talked?
1409300	1420300	Yeah, but as soon as that door closes and you hear this noise, the circular plate right ahead of you that you have your hand on begins opening from the middle.
1420300	1424300	It's doing that cool like.
1424300	1425300	Oh, where it's like.
1425300	1426300	Spiral.
1426300	1427300	Spirally like.
1427300	1428300	Yeah, it's cool.
1428300	1429300	Neat.
1429300	1430300	Yeah, it's very neat.
1430300	1431300	I'm gonna yell up.
1431300	1435300	Hey, there's a door.
1435300	1437300	Door's opening up down here.
1437300	1438300	Can you hear me?
1438300	1439300	You motherfucker.
1439300	1450300	Okay.
1450300	1455300	John, as you're banging on this door, you hear a voice from the other side.
1455300	1457300	Hey, can you hear me?
1457300	1459300	Is that the ghost of my friend?
1459300	1460300	I'm alive.
1460300	1462300	Lay still, restless spirit.
1462300	1464300	I'm alive still.
1464300	1468300	John, I landed on the pastor.
1468300	1470300	He's knocked out.
1470300	1471300	I'm good.
1471300	1473300	You didn't get sent back in time.
1473300	1475300	No, but there's a door.
1475300	1477300	The pastor's not Silas Cole.
1477300	1486300	He broke my fall with his body and head and the helmet got a little smashed.
1486300	1487300	Well.
1487300	1492300	So there's no light on and one of the tubes is broken, but I am wearing it.
1492300	1494300	Nothing's happened yet.
1494300	1496300	Oh, well, maybe take that off.
1496300	1500300	Let's just count our blessings that he's knocked out and it's broken.
1500300	1503300	I've avoided one head trauma already.
1503300	1507300	I'd like to avoid any in the future, so I'm gonna keep it on.
1507300	1513300	Do you think after all the modifications to that thing, it still functions for its original intended, like, safety purposes?
1513300	1514300	I don't know.
1514300	1520300	Hopefully I don't need to find out, but the tube's broken, so I don't think it's gonna be working anyway.
1520300	1521300	There's a door down there?
1521300	1526300	Yeah, just as soon as that one that you're on shut, this one opened up.
1526300	1528300	It's like a circle.
1528300	1529300	I'm about to go in it.
1529300	1534300	I just wanted you guys to let you guys know that I'm safe.
1534300	1535300	As safe as I can be again.
1535300	1536300	Wait, wait, wait for us!
1536300	1538300	I don't know.
1538300	1543300	Let me survey my surroundings and see how many feet I think down I am from you.
1543300	1544300	You're a beans, right?
1544300	1550300	I'm about, I would say, ten feet from that door and I don't know how to open it up.
1550300	1552300	Are you a beans or are you not a beans?
1552300	1555300	I'm a freakin' Keith Beans, baby.
1555300	1558300	Well then think real hard about this door and open it for us.
1558300	1563300	Is the room I'm in small enough to, like, do this up, you know?
1563300	1569300	He is currently trying, he's doing what a person who can't swim thinks swimming is.
1569300	1572300	I think it's what he's doing with his arms currently.
1572300	1576300	Like, I wanna, like, press my arms and legs up against the wall and try to climb up it.
1576300	1580300	Yeah, it's a little bit, it's about six feet across.
1580300	1583300	Yeah, I'd probably hurt myself doing that anyway, so good.
1583300	1584300	That'd be really difficult.
1584300	1585300	You can try if you want.
1585300	1586300	I think I'm stuck down here.
1586300	1587300	Wish me luck, I guess.
1587300	1590300	Should I, what do you think I should do with Adam?
1590300	1591300	He's passed out.
1591300	1593300	Should I just leave him here?
1593300	1595300	Ask him how he opened the door.
1595300	1601300	Well, he's unconscious right now and I, like, kinda nudge him with my foot.
1601300	1602300	Is there any reaction?
1602300	1604300	I'm not telling you.
1604300	1606300	He does not seem to be awake.
1606300	1609300	Yeah, no, there's no reaction.
1609300	1613300	I think he's out cold.
1613300	1616300	I'm gonna leave him here unless you think I should kill him.
1616300	1618300	Oh, you should kill him!
1618300	1619300	No!
1619300	1620300	Is Clark there?
1620300	1621300	Keith!
1621300	1622300	Keith!
1622300	1623300	Kill him!
1623300	1624300	Now!
1624300	1625300	Kill him!
1625300	1628300	Well, what if we need information from him?
1628300	1630300	Uh-uh, no.
1630300	1631300	Who cares?
1631300	1634300	Clark, Clark, can you hear me?
1634300	1639300	I mean, I, I, I'm, lest be left, I'm way far away.
1639300	1642300	I think at this point you've, you've at least watched.
1642300	1646300	You've seen me screaming at the door.
1646300	1651300	Clark, as you, as you finally decide to stand, uh, you're well aware of the stain on your
1651300	1657300	pants, but you're looking over and you can see that, uh, this cat is on top of the radio
1657300	1663300	and is violently pointing one paw at the broken tube and pointing the other paw at John Lee
1663300	1665300	Pettymore, the Thirth.
1665300	1669300	But John is, you know, on top of this metal plate, either banging on it or yelling through
1669300	1670300	it, so.
1670300	1671300	Clark!
1671300	1674300	Keith, Keith, are you, are you down there?
1674300	1675300	You, you all right?
1675300	1676300	Clark, Keith's down there.
1676300	1680300	He landed on top of Pastor Adam Kane and he's got him knocked out silly and he wants to
1680300	1684300	know if he should just leave him before he moves on to the next door or if she should
1684300	1685300	kill him.
1685300	1686300	I said kill him, right?
1686300	1688300	Do you have your gun on you down there?
1688300	1689300	I look around.
1689300	1691300	Is my gun down here with me?
1691300	1698300	At this moment, Clark Bishop, you hear a whoa and looking at the stump at the end of one
1698300	1704300	of the forearms, Casey Kristoff, enough blood has splattered up out of this forearm that
1704300	1709300	his eyes just kind of go wobbly and then the rest of his body weebles, wobbles, but it
1709300	1714300	definitely falls down and he just kind of like passes out on his side and Kerry pages
1714300	1717300	looks at you guys and does a shrug.
1717300	1720300	I mean, we weren't paying attention to him anyways.
1720300	1722300	I'm just saying.
1722300	1724300	That's what the listeners see, asshole.
1724300	1726300	Do I have my gun on me down here?
1726300	1727300	Uh, yeah.
1727300	1734300	I was thinking about, uh, you know, just leaving him out, knocked out, but if he comes
1734300	1736300	to, I don't want him to attack me.
1736300	1737300	John thinks I should kill him.
1737300	1738300	What do you think?
1738300	1742300	I don't know about killing him because I'd like to know what he knows about all this.
1742300	1743300	What was his plan?
1743300	1747300	I'm going to like shoot him in the foot so he can't chase me.
1747300	1748300	How about that?
1748300	1751300	He can probably heal with his dark lord.
1751300	1752300	Kill him.
1752300	1754300	Fuck what he knows.
1754300	1757300	We can ask his fucking wife what he knew.
1757300	1764300	Oh, we can ask his second in command what he knew.
1764300	1765300	You know what I mean?
1765300	1767300	Kill that fool.
1767300	1772300	I'm going to like do this with my shoulders to cover my ears and like, what'd you do?
1772300	1775300	I'm going to do this with one ear and then the other one, I'm going to do that.
1775300	1780300	He's currently, he's sticking one, shoot him in the foot and then he's covering his
1780300	1786300	other ear with a shoulder while holding the gun with the shoulder covered arm.
1786300	1788300	And then one finger in my ear.
1788300	1789300	All right.
1789300	1790300	And where are you shooting him?
1790300	1791300	In the foot.
1796300	1797300	Ker-pow.
1797300	1799300	Damn it, Keith, at least take both feet.
1799300	1801300	Do I hit him?
1801300	1804300	We hear the gunshot from up top.
1804300	1807300	Keith, did you, did you, did you kill him?
1807300	1812300	No, I, I shot him in the foot cause if he comes through then he won't chase me.
1812300	1815300	He'll, or at least not, uh, well.
1815300	1816300	Not, not speedily.
1816300	1817300	Yeah, exactly.
1817300	1818300	Shoot him in both feet.
1818300	1820300	I shoot him in the other foot.
1825300	1827300	He's got a decent chance now of bleeding out.
1829300	1831300	This is what we call an elegant compromise, gentlemen.
1834300	1835300	All right, let me roll some dice.
1835300	1836300	This is, this is, uh.
1838300	1843300	Also after I shoot him in the other foot, I want to like put his feet up on the wall
1843300	1845300	so they're elevated so they don't bleed as much.
1846300	1847300	What the fuck?
1848300	1849300	God damn it.
1849300	1850300	Guys.
1850300	1851300	That's incredible.
1851300	1852300	I have to kill him.
1853300	1854300	Okay.
1854300	1857300	Do you think anything he knows is going to help us save the town?
1858300	1859300	I don't know.
1859300	1862300	I don't want one more body on my conscious.
1862300	1867300	I really, I'm, I'm kind of hoping that Adam is on the right track and we can use it for
1867300	1869300	our purposes and not bad ones.
1869300	1870300	Yeah.
1870300	1873300	Well, not his bad ones.
1876300	1877300	All right.
1877300	1878300	Keith, what are you doing?
1878300	1879300	I'm going through that hole.
1879300	1894300	I step over the threshold into where, is it dark or can I see, what do I see?
1894300	1904300	As soon as this one opens, there's light coming from down and on the other side of this circular
1904300	1913300	entrance, there are metal ladder rungs that are going down and there's light coming from
1913300	1914300	down.
1914300	1915300	Okay.
1915300	1918300	I peek my head back through the hole and I say, sleep tight.
1918300	1920300	And then I go down the ladder.
1921300	1922300	Okay.
1922300	1931300	And when you make it down the ladder rungs, you are standing on top of a metal mining
1931300	1936300	elevator and it's got a door on the top that swings open that you can jump down into the
1936300	1937300	elevator.
1937300	1940300	I swing it open and I jumped down into the elevator.
1940300	1946300	And you, there's a button there that you can control like a power strip looking thing that
1946300	1947300	hangs from the ceiling.
1948300	1950300	I press down on it.
1950300	1951300	And you start.
1959300	1960300	Is this good?
1961300	1972300	And you stop basically this whole way down.
1972300	1979300	It was just a rock was around you and where there would be one of the metal cage walls,
1979300	1981300	there just was opening to the rock.
1981300	1983300	So you could reach out and touch the rock.
1983300	1985300	Whereas the other three walls were metal cage.
1985300	1986300	Okay.
1986300	1994300	But at the very bottom, instead of rock where it is open to you, there is a blast door.
1994300	1995300	There's a what?
1995300	1996300	A blast door.
1996300	1997300	Okay.
1997300	2005300	So it's like round on the top and there's a big like circular window all fogged up and
2005300	2007300	old and musty.
2007300	2014300	And then there's a big wheel and then there's a large arm that is latched locking this door
2014300	2015300	shut.
2015300	2016300	Okay.
2016300	2021300	I want to try to unlatch it and use the wheel for whatever it does.
2021300	2022300	Yeah.
2022300	2027300	So you unlatch this big metal locking mechanism essentially.
2027300	2034300	And then you as the wheel, it's like it's been a while since this cold metal.
2034300	2036300	I spit on it a little bit.
2036300	2037300	Yeah.
2037300	2038300	It gets it.
2038300	2042300	Oh, and it gets it going.
2042300	2043300	I like that.
2043300	2052300	And so you open up this door and it opens and you feel the room almost pressurize as
2052300	2053300	it's just been so long.
2053300	2054300	Yeah.
2054300	2055300	You got to pop my ears.
2055300	2063300	It's like I'm on an airplane in the earth and it opens up into the bottom of the earth
2063300	2069300	and it opens up in the astronaut movie where they drill, which I forget what that one was
2069300	2071300	called or Armageddon.
2071300	2072300	I don't remember.
2072300	2073300	Definitely Armageddon.
2073300	2082300	So I go in behind this heavy metal blast door is a cavernous laboratory.
2082300	2089300	It smells musty earthy with a tinge of mold and the air is thick and humid.
2089300	2095300	The floor is poorly laid concrete, rough and uneven and concrete covers about six feet
2096300	2103300	up the walls before the rock of the cave structure takes over to form 10 more feet of wall that
2103300	2110300	slowly becomes a cathedral ceiling complete with stalactites dripping fruitlessly on the
2110300	2113300	concrete floor below.
2113300	2119300	Lining the right side of the room are these massive copper vats with all sorts of gauges
2119300	2120300	and tubing on them.
2120300	2126300	The left side is an absolute mess of tables and shelves with papers and folders strewn
2126300	2131300	about haphazardly over this workstation in total disarray.
2131300	2139300	And finally on the far side of the subterranean chamber there is another metal blast door.
2139300	2146300	The lever and wheel to open this thick threshold are on your side and again there is a round
2146300	2150300	window looking into whatever is on the other side.
2150300	2157300	I want to go over to the tables and kind of like look at the papers and see what they're
2157300	2158300	all about.
2158300	2166300	You find blueprints for a gun, a radio, a helmet, and a camera.
2166300	2167300	Hell yeah.
2167300	2171300	These things are clearly made with this math.
2171300	2176300	There's math all over these pages and looking at it doesn't make a whole lot of sense
2176300	2180300	to you but you didn't go to school for mathematics so I'm assuming you don't have a math
2180300	2182300	skill on your character sheet?
2182300	2183300	No.
2183300	2184300	Go ahead and roll intelligence for me.
2184300	2186300	It's my lowest.
2186300	2187300	Imagine that.
2187300	2190300	42 on a 50.
2190300	2198300	Okay so you know just by looking at these that certain equations don't quote unquote
2198300	2199300	add up.
2200300	2207300	Something about this math is incorrect to you but it seems to be working on the page.
2207300	2215300	He's making or she whatever is making these blueprints based on this science.
2215300	2220300	However there's a whole other set of papers that seem to be devoted.
2220300	2222300	It's like this one notebook.
2222300	2230300	It's trying to come up with some sort of word combination that will grant eternal life
2230300	2232300	is what it says.
2232300	2240300	However there are notes on each page of each time this has been used and the complications
2240300	2245300	and the complications are brutal.
2245300	2254300	The first is like thinning of skin and the second one says removal of nails and the third
2254300	2267300	one is like hair has begun falling out and the final one says humanity seems to be gone.
2267300	2269300	Fuck.
2269300	2272300	You find this giant folder.
2272300	2283300	It's working on something called manipulating activator robot A and it is a picture of a
2283300	2293300	one inch in diameter circular ball and there are 24 of them and each one A B C they're
2293300	2295300	all crossed out.
2295300	2296300	All of them.
2296300	2308300	Until the final page the 25th one that says manipulating activator colon robot Y codename
2308300	2310300	Mary.
2310300	2312300	Mary.
2312300	2315300	Mary and Mary Cole.
2315300	2318300	I wonder if it's Mary Cole.
2318300	2320300	Is she a robot?
2320300	2323300	Is there anything else written on the piece of paper?
2323300	2328300	At the bottom it says host found.
2328300	2331300	Ooh.
2331300	2333300	Ooh.
2333300	2343300	Ooh.
2343300	2345300	Did you die in other world Luke?
2345300	2348300	I'm in the basement of Bean's Pond.
2348300	2351300	I'm still alive as far as I know.
2351300	2353300	You still in a hole?
2353300	2355300	I'm in a hole.
2355300	2357300	I'm deep in a hole.
2357300	2359300	That's boring.
2359300	2361300	What I did is not boring.
2361300	2363300	No it didn't look like it.
2363300	2364300	Okay bye bye.
2364300	2365300	Goodbye.
2365300	2366300	Goodbye.
2366300	2371300	You guys hear another door inside of wherever Keith Figna has disappeared to another door
2371300	2376300	inside you kind of hear it go and then there's just silence.
2376300	2381300	Carrie Pages begins walking cautiously down the muddy hillside.
2381300	2383300	Bubblegum tree.
2383300	2385300	Bubblegum tree.
2385300	2391300	Pointing at her own body and saying I don't even know.
2391300	2392300	Drew we know.
2392300	2393300	We know Drew.
2393300	2394300	We know it's you.
2394300	2396300	We've been calling you Drew Carey.
2396300	2397300	Am I now?
2397300	2399300	Can I just be Drew then please?
2399300	2404300	I don't know it's kind of funny when you talk.
2404300	2408300	Do you know do you know where my body is?
2408300	2410300	Last we left it it was in the sewer.
2410300	2411300	What?
2411300	2412300	What?
2412300	2413300	It's in a safe place.
2413300	2416300	Okay then not just in the sewer waters.
2416300	2421300	No no no not just like floating down there it's in Harry and Gary are with it actually.
2421300	2426300	Well that's much better than what I thought when you said my body is in the sewers.
2426300	2428300	It's so good to see you guys.
2428300	2429300	Did you get eyes on that shooter?
2429300	2431300	Did you see where that shot came from?
2431300	2439300	When you all look over you see there's a slight opening like a walkway in this floating moat
2439300	2452300	this water and walking right through it is...
2452300	2454300	You bastard.
2454300	2456300	He's gotta roll a character.
2457300	2463300	Hold on let me just find a Patreon character real quick.
2463300	2471300	It's a woman wearing an emerald green smoking jacket with a black silk bow tie and she is
2471300	2480300	smiling a cold vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes and you recognize
2480300	2483300	her immediately as Karen.
2483300	2484300	And love.
2484300	2488300	Two different people you recognize her as two different people.
2488300	2490300	Oh is Karen not the smile lady?
2490300	2492300	No 100% you got it right.
2492300	2494300	Gotcha.
2494300	2501300	And she is holding this like badass looking rifle got a super long barrel on it but it
2501300	2507300	clearly she's like folding the stock up into the gun to where it literally becomes just
2507300	2513300	like a handheld thing but it's still got this long barrel on it that she then turns
2513300	2517300	and then makes that shorter as well and turns it back into just like a handgun.
2517300	2522300	She holsters it on her side and holds up both of her hands.
2522300	2528300	I am just as confused as the both of you.
2528300	2529300	Clark pulls his gun on her.
2529300	2535300	No that is understandable I'm sure but you know it's been a while so I think now that
2535300	2540300	we're both circle of knowledge members maybe we can let bygones be bygones.
2540300	2542300	Bygones be bygones?
2542300	2546300	It's my parents and you killed my fucking parents.
2546300	2552300	Yeah I know I know I know it's my bad it's my bad it's my bad but it was my job I was
2552300	2559300	looking for the book you know Jim sent me to look for the book it's not my issue I was
2559300	2561300	given you know orders.
2561300	2563300	Clark is going to kind of approach her with the gun.
2564300	2565300	She's pointing at Kevin.
2565300	2573300	Kevin you know what I'm talking about also what the fuck it's good to see you it's been
2573300	2576300	so long what the where have you been?
2576300	2581300	Some aliens took me remind me where we were the last remind me what happened the last
2581300	2586300	time that kind of fuzzed my memory what was the last time I saw you?
2586300	2592300	Shit let's see Clark could you put that down for I mean just like aim it not at me I guess
2592300	2596300	for now although I've heard you've got the hell of a trigger finger anyway don't aim
2596300	2597300	it at me please.
2597300	2600300	I don't think I will and I keep it pointed at her.
2600300	2601300	Also fair.
2601300	2605300	Oh shit Kevin did you like lose your memory or some shit?
2605300	2607300	Yeah that's what happened.
2607300	2609300	That is such a bummer.
2609300	2610300	Because of the aliens.
2610300	2612300	Oh what did they look like?
2612300	2614300	Classic little gray men.
2614300	2616300	All those kooks were right.
2616300	2617300	I've never seen those.
2617300	2621300	I've seen the tall ones the lanky fellas.
2621300	2622300	Mine were little.
2622300	2623300	Huh.
2623300	2629300	Okay so I guess last time we were going through with that whole deal to fuck over Marvin Glass
2629300	2630300	right?
2630300	2633300	And then you just disappeared you and Kyle I never saw you again.
2633300	2635300	How were we gonna fuck over Marvin Glass?
2635300	2639300	Well we stole all this cocaine and all that weapon shit man you remember that?
2639300	2643300	We were gonna sell it but then after you guys got caught I just dipped out I got the fuck
2643300	2644300	out of there.
2644300	2648300	Sure sure and did you leave it in our green box?
2648300	2649300	Yeah.
2649300	2652300	Good thinking good thinking Karen good job good work.
2652300	2656300	Yeah along with all the other shit I mean wait did you end up getting the rest of the
2656300	2657300	vectors?
2657300	2661300	Because I couldn't find any ever and then I ended up just going a whole other direction.
2661300	2665300	Jim recruited me to this thing that Clark and I are now in Circle of Knowledge.
2665300	2668300	Kevin Clark have you told Kevin about Circle of Knowledge?
2668300	2669300	I've mentioned it.
2669300	2670300	We call it cock.
2670300	2678300	I've never thought about that I love cock.
2678300	2683300	The stuff we're doing there is great like K cell was one thing but like this shit is
2683300	2687300	legitimately staving off the end of the world swear to god.
2687300	2690300	You mentioned Kyle who was Kyle?
2690300	2693300	Kevin do you want to take this do you know what happened to Kyle?
2693300	2694300	Tell him Karen.
2694300	2699300	Wait hold on I but you guys disappeared the same day you guys were out what are you doing?
2699300	2702300	You were running to Apples Beans to go get coffee?
2702300	2707300	Apples Beans I did enjoy Apples Beans I've got to tell you Karen.
2708300	2712300	Since the abduction it's just a blur.
2712300	2714300	Yeah that makes sense.
2714300	2716300	Oh shit who's this one?
2716300	2718300	And she points at Drew.
2718300	2721300	That's the city councilwoman she doesn't know about any of this.
2721300	2724300	Oh well then we should probably fucking kill her.
2724300	2725300	No no no I mean.
2725300	2729300	No offense sorry you just shouldn't have this information and continue to live but then
2729300	2732300	again I guess this whole town's gonna have to die.
2732300	2735300	She doesn't know what we're talking about none of this town has to die.
2735300	2740300	Look around you and you all see that you're still in this you know the pond's not in
2740300	2744300	the pond but it is you know around you in a big wall.
2744300	2745300	What's your point?
2745300	2749300	Well it's just that you know it's kind of our job to make sure that normal people no
2749300	2753300	offense don't have this kind of knowledge.
2753300	2758300	Alright listen Karen I didn't know if I could trust you but she's a familiar.
2758300	2759300	She's a what?
2759300	2760300	A friendly.
2760300	2762300	Oh okay I thought you meant like a witch's cat.
2762300	2764300	Yeah I said the wrong thing first didn't I?
2764300	2768300	You saved her why'd you why'd you why'd you save the councilwoman here?
2768300	2774300	Oh I was listening in on this whole situation and it seemed like you guys were on her side
2774300	2779300	and so I figured I'd take out the fucking hillbilly.
2779300	2784300	That was a good read we are on our side she's one of our good friends and she's a friendly.
2784300	2790300	And why is this cat an actual seeming familiar pointing with its paws so intelligently?
2791300	2796300	That is a an FBI agent that you know what if we'd done things your way Karen we should
2796300	2802300	have just killed him right away but instead we needed his body to have the alright see
2802300	2809300	first this guy named Doug got he got put in the body of that cat right?
2809300	2811300	Sure I'm I'm following.
2811300	2817300	His mind was in there his mind was in that cat and we we like Doug Doug was working with
2817300	2824300	us and there was this FBI agent that we didn't like he was not working with us so we you
2824300	2833300	know we did a little mind switcheroo and we put Doug cat into FBI agents body and now
2833300	2837300	the FBI agent is in the his mind is in the body of the cat and he really wants out and
2837300	2838300	he hates us.
2838300	2842300	Wait is that the FBI agent that was sent to deal with you guys?
2842300	2844300	Clark you were sent to take care of him right?
2844300	2846300	Yeah that's how we did it.
2846300	2851300	Oh yeah no he's not FBI I mean he you know he's kind of FBI but he's mostly working for
2851300	2855300	the asylum it's good that he's actually in a cat body that's perfect.
2855300	2857300	Well what's the asylum?
2857300	2862300	Well that's the okay Kevin you remember we were working K cell stuff eliminating the
2862300	2867300	vectors after that whole debacle in the woods and we were getting close to finishing when
2867300	2872300	we fast and furious that semi to steal Marvin Glass's shipment well right around that time
2872300	2878300	you and Kyle disappeared and Jim told me the asylum was shifting into a more bureaucratic
2878300	2883300	machine focusing more on obtaining technology rather than thwarting world ending vectors
2883300	2886300	so that's when he brought me into the circle of knowledge.
2886300	2888300	Do you know how long he'd been with the circle?
2888300	2889300	Jim?
2889300	2890300	Yeah.
2890300	2896300	Fuck as long as we've known him but yeah no this this little cat here was sent to actually
2896300	2903300	collect any sort of unnatural technology so likely looking for the book like we all
2903300	2911300	were but then certainly that black bag and the camera and what was it the radio?
2911300	2913300	How do you know all this?
2913300	2916300	Well I mean Clark told Leon about all that stuff.
2916300	2919300	McKinley and Harrison are they the asylum also?
2919300	2923300	McKinley and Harrison I get it that's cute.
2923300	2926300	You know they kind of helped us in the end.
2926300	2930300	Oh yeah no they're extremely helpful I'm it's just everybody's you know kind of doing the
2930300	2932300	same thing in different ways.
2932300	2936300	I guess that makes sense.
2936300	2941300	That could be like yeah the final line of the podcast.
2941300	2952300	I guess that makes sense.
2952300	2957300	Keith gets really excited and like tons of thoughts are running through his head but
2957300	2960300	he doesn't really know what to do with the information yet.
2960300	2966300	I'm like I really wish that those guys could get down here but also and then I pick up
2966300	2975300	the sheet of paper that has like the eternal life thing and I look at it and I'm I like
2975300	2981300	touch my bullet hole in my hip and then I look down at my ribs and I've got blood all
2981300	2989300	over my hand and I look at it and I say I hope my penis doesn't fall off and then I
2989300	2991300	say the words.
2991300	2995300	Oh my god dude.
2995300	2998300	Yes.
2998300	2999300	Oh fuck yeah.
2999300	3001300	Okay the last ones.
3001300	3002300	What do you mean?
3002300	3004300	There were multiple they were tribal in error.
3004300	3008300	I'll do the one that I'll say the one that you lose your nails.
3008300	3012300	Okay.
3012300	3016300	Al-hai-a-oob-dee.
3016300	3017300	Does anything happen?
3017300	3018300	Nothing happens.
3018300	3019300	Al-hai-a-oob-dee.
3019300	3020300	Al-hai-a-oob-dee.
3020300	3021300	Al-hai-a-oob-dee.
3021300	3022300	Al-hai-a-oob-dee.
3022300	3032300	Your bones begin to vibrate underneath your muscles and tendons your skeleton is shivering
3032300	3039300	and every single one of your fingernails and toenails feel like they are being pulled
3039300	3047300	up from the tips but instead of lifting from your nail beds the pain buzzes and the buzzing
3047300	3056300	grows and then your nails begin snapping off like popcorn popping and when the last kernel
3056300	3065300	of a nail has dissected itself from your being you hear a foreboding thud as something
3065300	3074300	slams into the other side of the blast door on the far end of this underground lab.
3074300	3076300	Oh fuck yeah.
3086300	3114300	How am I the only one trying to pull over?
3114300	3124300	How can you have enough drowning out all the notes?
3124300	3137300	With no mind at all, no mind at all.
