0	3800	Welcome to the cream zone, my lactose-filled babies.
3800	6780	I'm here to whip you up into a frothy beverage
6780	8800	for all to consume.
8800	13720	It's me, your warm milk-filled uncle Wolf the dog.
13720	16480	And as always, we are fermenting y'all
16480	19600	into some kind of weird sour milk cream
19600	23720	live from 694.2 PTBP.
23720	27240	So far, all of you beautiful, generous folks
27240	33440	have raised $6,372 for the bail project.
33440	34480	Wowza.
34480	37020	Remember, screenshot your donations
37020	40560	and send them to pretendinpod at gmail.com.
40560	45280	And for every $5 donated, you'll receive an entry for a chance
45280	50080	to win one of the first ever PTBP t-shirts.
50080	53960	This week's winner is Marie Lupin.
53960	58480	Congratulations, Marie, and keep on donating, y'all.
58480	61120	We have three more shirts to give away
61120	63920	to you charitable motherfuckers.
63920	67040	The link to donate is in the show notes.
67040	70680	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from a very sweet listener
70680	72120	called Chris.
72120	76480	He writes, a buddy of mine recommended PTBP to me
76480	79000	a while back, but I didn't think I would ever
79000	83240	be into an actual play podcast, let alone one
83280	85800	that features a game I've never heard of.
85800	88320	He kept nagging me, though, and I finally
88320	92120	gave in and listened to episode one a couple of months ago,
92120	94520	just so I could get it over with.
94520	97600	Since then, I've binged every episode,
97600	102600	became a patron, convinced two other friends and my brother
102600	105680	not only to start listening to PTBP,
105680	109080	but also to start playing Delta Green.
109080	112400	I've converted my wife as well, and we are now
112440	116880	relistening to old episodes in between new episodes
116880	118680	just to get our fix.
118680	122120	Then contention boys, the gravelly baritone
122120	126800	of the Mighty Wolf, and the manic brilliance of Zack
126800	130040	have been a source of so much joy during what has been
130040	132680	an incredibly hectic couple of months.
132680	135080	I cannot thank you guys enough.
135080	139840	Shout outs to my friends, Ruben, Alex, and Jesse,
139840	143040	my brother Michael, and my wife Maria,
143040	145360	all of whom are loyal listeners.
145360	149120	Lots of love from the Netherlands, Chris.
149120	152920	Wow, Chris, I know you said a bunch of other shit,
152920	156160	but acknowledging my baritone tones,
156160	159360	the gravel in my gullet, that's enough
159360	162160	to bring tears to my eyes, baby.
162160	165240	Maybe I'll take a little interdimensional trip
165240	167760	to the Netherlands you speak of.
167760	171480	Pay you and yours a little visit, you'll never see me,
171480	175760	but I'll definitely see and smell y'all.
175760	179440	Have you ever thought to yourself, wow,
179440	182720	I like this pretending to be people show very much.
182720	186120	I wonder if there's something easy I could do to help him.
186120	189320	The answer is very fucking much a yes.

209840	214640	Is there an echo in here, or is it just the news?
214640	219200	News, news, news, news, news.
219200	223080	Last time, our valiant heroes forced Terrence Liquor
223080	225240	into the home of Randy Angst,
225880	228000	where the old man was on the ground
228000	230720	in desperate need of medical attention.
230720	233040	Seeing they were about to get boxed in
233040	235480	on this residential street by a truck
235480	238160	with a hot tub instead of a truck bed,
238160	242120	as well as a Chevy Impala with a doorless refrigerator
242120	244600	on its side strapped to the roof.
244600	248120	They stole T Liquor's truck and hoofed it back
248120	253120	to the hidden Mitsubishi Eclipse to grab Drew Carey
253320	256040	without first losing their tail.
256040	259000	Clark grabbed Drew's body and tossed him
259000	261240	into the stolen truck's waterbed
261240	264880	as the refrigerator Impala and hot tub truck
264880	266720	pulled up to the scene.
266720	269440	There wasn't much of a standoff though,
269440	272240	due to hot tub truck immediately losing
272240	277240	its three team members to a massive wave of ooze.
277280	280520	The refrigerator Impala, owned and operated
280520	285040	by Asher and Avery Little, nope the fuck outta there,
285040	287640	leaving our waterbed truck crew
287640	292600	as this oozy upsurges only a remaining target.
292600	294920	John Lee Pettymore the 3rd,
294920	298840	perhaps still wet from his time in the bed of his truck,
298840	301840	critically failed a drive check,
301840	304640	taking us now to the aftermath.
304640	307440	It's a brand new track that rocks,
307440	312440	like sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous,
312600	315760	and rolls like a stolen truck
315760	318800	into a sign for a local tire shop.
318800	322320	It's kudzu with no backbone.
322320	323160	And now.
339040	343120	If a little rat dick left his seed in you,
343120	348120	wouldn't you fucking demand every goddamn cent
349480	351320	he had for that child? Welcome to Pretending to Be People.
351320	355920	That was the perfect introduction to episode.
355920	359240	No, I don't want to make an enemy of David Spade.
361720	363600	Welcome to Pretending to Be People.
363600	367600	That was a really good introduction to episode 82.
367600	369080	It works if you just blink out,
369080	372440	if you beep out the name of the celebrity.
375600	377040	Only the first time though.
382320	386920	She was discovered by radio superstar Howard Stern.
386920	388640	Her mother sent Stern pictures
388640	389880	and a letter about her daughter.
389880	392720	Stern had her in and sent her pictures to Playboy
392720	394040	and she was accepted.
394040	397480	Oh, that's an American like, thanks mom, dream.
398920	400880	I believe in you, honey.
400880	403480	Here, send your nude pictures to Howard Stern.
403480	404600	Her mom got to tell her
404600	406440	as soon as she got off the school bus.
406440	407280	Yeah.
411040	412360	Would you rather have to have sex
412360	414480	with a Howard Stern or David Spade?
420320	421720	Oh my God.
421720	424000	What a terrible, would you rather?
425480	427360	I guess both.
427360	429200	I'd probably go with David Spade.
429200	430560	I don't know enough about either of them.
430560	432200	So the romance wouldn't be there.
432200	433040	Either way.
434040	436400	Now I'm looking up ugly David Spade
436400	437800	and ugly Howard Stern
437800	440040	to see who has a worst picture on the internet.
443200	444040	Probably David Spade.
444040	446080	You can go to at pretending pod
446080	450560	to get a side by side of those on Instagram
450560	451440	or on Twitter.
451440	455560	We'll be tagging David Spade's family members.
455560	456960	He's cute when he's younger.
456960	459160	Yeah, if we're talking like Tommy boy years,
459160	460680	then it's David Spade all day.
460680	463080	But if we're talking about old, both of them,
463080	465000	then I think I have to go for Stern.
465000	466840	Stern's not bad looking.
466840	468000	Well, it would just be a freaky
468000	471080	kind of like Bourdain-ish experience.
471080	472600	We could probably get more viewers
472600	474520	if we were on Stern's show
474520	476920	than anything David Spade did.
476920	479400	Well, that's not happening after this.
481480	482320	After what?
482320	483800	After we said we want to fuck him?
485240	487520	Sounds to me like we're playing all our cards right.
487520	489480	I don't know anything about him,
489520	492200	but I think that's kind of his whole show, right?
494200	497480	Howard Stern kind of looks like if I was a dinosaur.
498920	499920	Like a raptor.
501040	502320	He's got the same hair.
503320	505120	You should grow yours out long like his.
505120	506440	Have it go down your back.
506440	510320	I mean, I don't plan on getting it cut anytime soon.
510320	511880	It's getting long, baby.
511880	514200	So last time John was driving the truck,
514200	516160	Crit failed to avoid the crane
516160	518080	and flipped it, freeze frame.
518120	519960	The truck is turned sideways,
519960	521480	hits a little rock or something.
521480	525040	Tires are bald as fuck and begins turning over.
525040	528640	In this moment, I have you guys all roll for constitution.
528640	530920	John critically succeeds.
530920	532440	Keith passes.
532440	534320	Clark critically succeeds.
534320	537520	As the truck is flying over, everyone is fine.
537520	541160	Seemingly, except for Keith lands on top of Jimmy Sanders.
541160	542600	Gonna roll for him right now.
544440	545560	Rolled to 98.
545560	546760	He's not doing great.
546760	551520	He's gonna lose four hit points and stays conscious
551520	553440	as Keith lands on top of him.
554320	556520	Critically succeeding his constitution check
556520	559040	to stay conscious because he's low on hit points
559040	560960	leading up to this point.
560960	564440	And Clark literally crits with a 69.
564440	567560	So as the truck rolls, the water's flying out behind him
567560	570680	as he just keeps his legs moving and keeps running
570680	572160	and the truck just avoids
572160	575080	and the truck moves, rolls, rolls, rolls
575200	580200	and explodes into a sign for owls, tires and tigers.
583440	584640	Oh yeah.
584640	589560	The issue being Drew's body with Kerry pages inside
589560	594360	lays motionless in an extremely shallow puddle
594360	596800	of stinky, stinky water.
596800	601800	And Gary Bailey from hanging halfway up out of a sewage drain
605240	606080	What are those called?
606080	607480	Just the like long thin ones
607480	609960	that the Kleinfella comes out of?
609960	610800	Sorry, storm drain?
610800	611640	Yes.
611640	613240	So what's a culvert?
613240	615440	Okay, can you actually not mention it?
615440	618080	Cause I was gonna make a dope it joke.
618080	620800	Okay, but I'm leaving that in for sure.
620800	621760	Cause that's funny.
625160	627760	So a storm drain, like a cauldron.
627760	629840	Is a cauldron like a witch?
629840	633320	I said culvert, which I think is an open drain.
633320	634880	Or maybe a culvert, right?
635560	637160	Is a big round one maybe
637160	639320	that comes out of like the side of a hill.
639320	640240	Joe's right.
640240	641400	Yeah, so we're all right.
641400	646400	And so it's a storm train on the side of the road
647520	650000	and Gary Daley is like half out of it.
650000	653920	Hands, elbows on the concrete and he's hollering at you.
653920	656320	Officer Bishop, Officer Vigna.
656320	658380	Oh, Keith, you need to get down here.
658380	659220	What are y'all doing?
659220	662960	And looking behind you, you see this ooze,
662960	666800	this massive grouping of ooze.
666800	669640	You've never seen this much all in one place before.
669640	672040	It is coming toward you slowly.
672040	674760	The back end of it coming up over the top
674760	677200	like waves breaking.
677200	678620	And as I'm doing this with my arms,
678620	680100	you can see my pit stains.
680100	682600	They are deep, wide.
682600	684680	Like the Lord's love.
684680	687800	And it is just flowing, flowing toward you.
689400	692120	And we are in combat order.
692120	693200	Clark Bishop, what do you do?
693200	694520	I want to try and run.
694520	695920	Am I near Drew's body?
695920	697200	If I'm still standing and running,
697200	699280	I would keep running toward it if I am.
699280	700520	Yeah, absolutely.
700520	702900	I want to run toward it and grab it and pick it up
702900	705060	and carry it with me toward Gary.
705060	706200	Okay, done.
706200	708280	You're definitely strong enough to pick up
708280	709720	a little Drew Andrews.
709720	713480	He's, you know, I believe he's got a fair amount of pudge,
713480	716360	but you can definitely throw him up over.
716360	719360	How are you carrying him as you're in?
719360	721440	Remember, as you pick him up,
721440	724720	you're picking up a wet Drew Andrews who's unconscious,
724720	727120	but you know it's not Drew inside.
727120	727960	Sure.
727960	730400	I just want to, if he's laying on the ground,
730400	734200	I want to grab his arms and like drape them over my back.
734200	737120	So his whole body's on my shoulders,
737120	739600	behind my neck on my shoulders.
739600	741480	So I think, is that a fireman's carry?
741480	742600	I think that's a fireman's carry.
742600	743720	I'm doing that.
743720	746820	And not only are you saving him from the fires
746820	749160	of wherever he might, no, there's no.
749800	750640	Hell.
750640	753040	You don't need a fire to have a fireman's carry.
753040	755560	Oh shit, Thomas, thank you so much.
755560	757040	I think legally you do.
757040	760120	I think that this might be an illegal maneuver
760120	761000	performing here.
761000	763280	Well, it's yeah, and it's not like a big thing.
763280	766080	It's just like a, you can't call it champagne thing.
767720	768560	Right, right.
770760	772400	Unjust laws should not be laws.
772400	773760	Keith Vigno, what are you doing?
773760	775560	Well, now hold on, hold on, hold on.
775560	778020	That protects the valor, like the growers
778020	779740	of the champagne region.
780740	781900	Yeah.
781900	783780	No, it's unjust, it's bullshit.
783780	784620	I don't think so.
784620	785440	Shouldn't exist.
785440	786660	I'm with the farmers.
786660	789060	I stand with the farmers of Champagne, France.
789060	790060	I don't think we've looked into it at all.
790060	792020	They're probably like huge landowners
792020	792940	who don't give a fuck.
792940	794780	Yeah, actually fuck them, you're right.
794780	796020	Yeah, fuck champagne.
797100	798620	Also, it makes my tummy hurt.
798620	800020	Keith Vigno, what are you doing?
800020	802060	Keith is kind of disoriented,
802060	806940	but just is running away from the explosion of the truck.
807780	809660	Well, you landed directly on Jimmy Sanders.
809660	810500	Oh, yeah.
810500	812420	Landed directly on him, and he's like,
812420	814700	number four, just get on top of me with the,
814700	815700	yeah, it's not even.
815700	817700	I stand up and I look at him,
817700	820600	and since I know he's conscious or whatever,
820600	822300	I kind of help him up,
822300	824780	and then I start running towards Gary.
824780	827300	Okay, so as you reach for his hand,
827300	830140	he's only looking past you and behind you
830140	832380	at the ooze that is chasing you.
832380	834340	So you can't run if you want to help him up.
834340	835580	You can only help him up.
835740	837260	Okay, I help him up then.
837260	838680	Oh, well that's very kind of you.
838680	841060	Can all three of us see the ooze currently?
841060	841940	Currently.
841940	842780	Okay.
842780	844540	If Keith is helping Jimmy up
844540	846980	and trying to get him to Gary,
846980	848660	I would like to do the same thing
848660	850480	and aid him and help that be quicker.
850480	852520	Oh, absolutely, then it is done,
852520	856540	and Tyler is immediately just following Clark Bishop.
858440	861420	Tyler is right on the heels of Clark Bishop,
861420	864940	and you are all running toward Gary Daley,
865180	867860	who has popped his head up out of this storm drain
867860	870820	with a beautiful bright yellow shirt
870820	872400	underneath a denim jacket,
872400	876860	which you can only see him from right above the nips up,
876860	878140	because he's hanging up out of here.
878140	880100	I put my arms out in front of the other two,
880100	881620	and I'm like, hold on, fellas,
881620	883920	we ain't got no way of knowing he ain't an it.
886860	890260	An it, an it, an it, it, from the movie It.
890260	891620	Oh, yeah.
891620	893980	Well, he doesn't look like a clown to me.
894020	896980	Are you Gary Daley, or are you an it?
896980	898460	Hurry up and get on down here.
898460	901440	We got me and Gary, and we got some others,
901440	903460	but we're hiding, and we need to save you.
903460	904980	Obviously, Keith, I mean,
904980	907340	Keith needs to get down here, especially.
907340	908180	Why me?
908180	909580	Everybody wants Keith.
909580	912340	Oh, well, yeah, because he, yeah, they're after you.
913300	915780	Gary, tell us something only Gary would know.
915780	918420	I did a magic spell on you to give you luck.
918420	919620	Come on, hurry up.
919620	921980	Yeah, good, that's what I was looking for, all right.
921980	923740	I run towards it, and I kind of like.
924340	925700	Wait, Keith, even if it is Gary,
925700	927780	we don't know what his intentions are anymore.
927780	928620	We've been gone for a while.
928620	931100	It sounds like everybody in town's with this daddy guy.
931100	933660	As he's saying that, I'm slide tackling
933660	936940	like you would on a soccer field down into the storm train.
936940	939860	Oh, hell yeah, do your shorts like balloon up out,
939860	942900	like give you some drag to slow you down
942900	944260	so you can slip in easy?
944260	945100	Yep.
945100	946180	So you can slip in easy.
946180	949660	And as soon as I'm in, I process what Clark just said,
949660	951820	and I look at Gary, I'm like, ugh.
951820	956140	No, it's cool, we're hiding from the FCFC,
956140	957900	they're scary fuckers.
957900	959820	That cane he's just taking over town,
959820	962340	we gotta hide down here, otherwise they'll find us.
962340	964540	And then immediately is like, oh shit,
964540	966860	and closes his eyes with his hand.
966860	968220	Gary, could you see it?
968220	970100	Well, I didn't wanna see it,
970100	971900	because then it'll come.
971900	973420	It comes to those who have seen it?
973420	974940	If you're looking at it, hold on,
974940	977020	get the fuck down here, get on down.
977020	978820	I'm helping Drew down there, I'm getting down in there,
978820	981140	and when I get down in there, I'm picking Drew back up,
981300	983260	getting him just back on my shoulder so that we're mobile.
983260	985860	And Tyler does that adorable thing that dogs do
985860	988260	when they crawl, because it's so cute.
989160	990900	Their paws just kind of move,
990900	992900	and then just jumps down into it.
992900	995180	And once you guys are all down there,
995180	997180	you got Jimmy Sanders down there as well,
997180	1000780	and he's just not paying attention to anything.
1000780	1003900	He immediately just starts stepping into the sewage water.
1003900	1007780	Basically, I'm seeing it as this tunnel that you're now in.
1007780	1009140	You gotta walk away on the right,
1009140	1010940	you gotta walk away on the far left,
1011580	1016140	you've got a sewage waterway moving slowly
1016140	1017720	in between the two pathways,
1017720	1022180	and then we've got an arched tunnel roof made out of stone
1022180	1024560	that leads off into the darkness ahead,
1024560	1027300	and you can't see where it leads to.
1027300	1031540	And Gary looks at John Lee Pettymore the third,
1031540	1036300	and he's like, you, you're, hi Gary,
1036300	1039500	this is actually John Lee Pettymore the fourth
1039500	1041680	in the body of my daddy.
1042740	1046060	Obviously, that's a lot to take in and a lot to believe,
1046060	1048340	but I feel like you're seeing the goo monster out there,
1048340	1049420	and you know what's going on,
1049420	1053820	so you can probably just move past this, right?
1053820	1055380	And accept that it's happening.
1055380	1058220	I don't like that at all,
1058220	1061700	and I especially don't like that you've, you're dripping.
1061700	1063060	You know you're dripping, right?
1063060	1065580	Well, I was in, yeah, dripping water.
1065580	1067140	No siree.
1067420	1071420	Your nose, your eyes, your ears, your mouth.
1071420	1072940	You got the goo coming out of you,
1072940	1074420	but it doesn't seem to be,
1075460	1077740	it's like small enough to not be at,
1077740	1080180	and he like, he wants to poke at it,
1080180	1081980	but he's not quite poking at it,
1081980	1084260	and he's like, honestly, if I could just not look at you,
1084260	1086780	that would be for the best for me personally,
1086780	1089640	because I am, and he's rubbing his fingers
1089640	1091340	against his other fingers,
1091340	1093380	and he starts looking at his hands,
1093380	1094660	and he's like, yep.
1094660	1096220	All right, you're dripping.
1096260	1098740	Yep, just a little bit, just enough.
1098740	1101500	Yeah, does that allow you to see the goo?
1101500	1102340	Yep.
1102340	1103220	Oh, interesting.
1103220	1104300	I was gonna clarify,
1104300	1105540	when he was talking about the dripping,
1105540	1106540	we didn't see it, right?
1106540	1108900	No, am I the only one you see it coming out of?
1108900	1110540	And he looks at the rest of you,
1110540	1112860	and he really avoids eye contact
1112860	1114860	with John Lee Pettymore III from here on out,
1114860	1116300	and he's like, okay, so,
1116300	1119540	and he kind of puts his hand up over your face,
1119540	1123180	and he's like, okay, so you are the missing
1123180	1128180	John Lee Pettymore III, who inside of you
1128260	1131220	is our John Lee Pettymore, who's been around,
1131220	1134300	and do I have all that right?
1134300	1136060	I nod at him and confirm.
1136060	1137980	More or less, yes.
1137980	1139460	Yeah, Gary, he's telling the truth.
1139460	1141460	But, Clark Bishop, you're not like
1141460	1143460	your parents aren't inside of you?
1143460	1145540	Nope, I'm 100% Clark right now.
1145540	1147740	No, but he does have his own fun thing
1147740	1151080	with vis-a-vis an older, you know,
1151120	1153440	I'm not gonna spoil it, but it's kooky.
1153440	1155180	What's his reaction to that?
1155180	1156480	I have a human of 30.
1156480	1158800	Can I see if I catch anything in his face?
1158800	1160040	Yeah, go ahead and roll.
1161620	1162560	I rolled a six.
1162560	1163920	Oh, shit, yeah.
1163920	1166860	No, giving him that much information
1166860	1170640	about old Clark Bishop, you don't notice anything.
1170640	1172100	Okay.
1172100	1174880	Gary, I'm still me, I'm still Keith.
1175800	1179240	And Drew is actually Kerry Pages.
1179280	1181440	Oh, yeah, when you were asking about that.
1181440	1183240	Fuck, yeah, we forgot to mention that.
1183240	1185420	I'm sorry, what?
1185420	1187600	John Three's actually John Four.
1187600	1190160	Me and Clark are who we are,
1190160	1192840	and Drew is Kerry inside of Drew's body.
1192840	1194080	Yep, he's got it right.
1194080	1196120	And I don't mean to be rude,
1196120	1198040	and he starts petting Tyler,
1198040	1200200	and he's like, who are you, my little fella?
1200200	1203340	This is Kerry Pages' dog, Tyler.
1203340	1206320	And Tyler is being very attentive
1206320	1209760	to the body of Drew Andrews,
1209760	1212200	which is still being held by Clark Bishop.
1212200	1214160	Yeah, see how it's focused on Drew there?
1214160	1215440	I think it's because it's,
1215440	1220440	well, Drew has the soul, or the mind, or presence,
1220940	1222440	however you want to define it,
1222440	1224040	of Councilwoman Kerry Pages,
1224040	1225200	because of the church. Or the baguette.
1225200	1227320	You know, it might be the baguette that he's got,
1227320	1230000	because, you know, it's a long, long baguette,
1230000	1231500	but you gotta cut it in thirds
1231500	1233860	in order to make an eight-inch sandwich,
1233860	1235480	which is what you're gonna wanna get.
1235720	1239080	Yeah, and Jimmy's just, he's not right right now, so.
1240060	1241440	But he is Jimmy.
1241440	1244240	What's going on with the pastor and everything in town?
1244240	1245760	We've just got back to town,
1245760	1247800	already seen some weird shit
1247800	1250280	that I can't make complete sense of yet.
1250280	1251940	What are you doing down here, even?
1251940	1254000	Gary Daley flips a Zippo,
1254000	1259000	and you see his very brightly colored yellow button down.
1259660	1261920	He's got a denim jacket over the top of it,
1261920	1263800	and he's like,
1263800	1267120	I have been hoping that you guys would come back
1268040	1269720	ever since yesterday.
1269720	1271200	What happened yesterday?
1271200	1274660	Everything went to shit.
1275680	1280160	We're down here hiding because that crazy lunatic
1280160	1285160	put up a wall of water and fish around the church,
1285160	1288280	and has taken to calling himself Daddy,
1288280	1290420	and he has held them all convinced
1290420	1292440	that he can go back in time
1292440	1294500	as long as he can get Keith Vick.
1294500	1296800	You guys are looking at me like you already know all this.
1296800	1297960	Well, we've seen the wall.
1297960	1299160	Yeah, we've heard all that.
1299160	1301560	I mean, as soon as that went up,
1301560	1302920	he got a lot of followers,
1302920	1306400	and he's been interpreting people's dreams,
1306400	1308280	and they've just been following him
1308280	1309880	to the end of the earth, basically,
1309880	1311320	and they'll do whatever he wants.
1311320	1313480	Do you know exactly what he wants with me?
1313480	1316800	I just know that he thinks that he needs you
1316800	1318760	to go back in time somehow.
1318760	1320420	Okay.
1320420	1323340	Well, I'm not really trying to help him out.
1323340	1324900	Are you guys on the internet?
1324900	1326780	Just a crazy question,
1326780	1328860	but you don't strike me as people
1328860	1331140	who have a lot of points in computer science.
1331140	1332460	Heh heh heh.
1332460	1335020	Uh, weird way to put it,
1335020	1338480	but I would say I took a class in high school.
1338480	1340740	I have email.
1340740	1342340	I have email.
1342340	1344100	I've got a Facebook.
1344100	1345660	I've got a telephone at the house.
1345660	1347500	I could maybe call somebody.
1347500	1352500	So I found a website, a blog post from Harold Dorsey
1352660	1354860	that got wiped off the internet.
1354860	1355980	Nobody could've found it
1355980	1357940	if you just would've Googled around.
1357940	1358820	It got wiped.
1358820	1360060	Somebody took it off, but...
1360060	1361380	What'd it say?
1361380	1362820	See for yourself.
1362820	1366340	And Gary Daley holds up a phone.
1366340	1370020	He's got a screenshot of this blog.
1370020	1375020	So you can go to what'sbehinddorsey.blogspot.com.
1375220	1376060	Okay.
1377500	1381260	Holy shit.
1381260	1382860	Okay, woo.
1382860	1384200	So for the listeners out there,
1384200	1387940	you can go to what'sbehinddorsey.blogspot.com.
1387940	1389900	Dorsey is D-O-R-S-E-Y,
1389900	1394900	and Harold is and always was H-A-R-R-E-L-L.
1397260	1399420	People were talking like it was Harold.
1399420	1400460	It was never Harold.
1400460	1401860	Yeah, cause that's a name
1403380	1404860	that people are familiar with.
1404860	1405700	Yeah.
1407060	1410820	Zach says it was set up in May, 2017.
1410820	1413900	Did you really register a blogger account
1413900	1415680	three years ago for this campaign?
1415680	1416540	Yeah.
1416540	1417380	That's dope.
1417380	1418220	Wow.
1418220	1420020	Did you just know you wanted to do something like this
1420020	1422500	or did you actually set one up for Harold Dorsey?
1423400	1424780	It was for Harold Dorsey.
1424780	1425620	That's dope.
1425620	1426520	This is dope as fuck.
1427620	1429800	Okay, so for those of you who are driving
1429800	1431020	or doing the dishes
1431020	1433680	or you're wearing AirPods and you're pooping
1433680	1435800	and your phone is in the other room,
1435800	1439000	if you go to what'sbehinddorsey.blogspot.com,
1439000	1441780	you'll find a blog that is entitled
1441780	1443500	What's Behind Dorsey?
1443500	1446920	A True Story in a False City.
1446920	1451920	And there is a single blog posted on Monday, December 3rd,
1451960	1456960	and it is entitled Operation San Ferra Blum
1457000	1460760	and a Rogue Police Chief in Contention.
1460760	1463960	Followers of my story know I am not afraid
1463960	1465440	of rocking the boat.
1465440	1467120	I was fired from the city star
1467120	1469560	for threatening to self-publish my expose
1469560	1471040	on the glass crime family
1471040	1474120	after a blasphemous night of depravity
1474120	1477540	undercover at the glass compound's robot-inclusive
1477540	1480760	fight club called the Scrap Pit.
1480760	1482920	Lots of people know about the Scrap Pit.
1482920	1485680	The real party, for those in the know,
1485680	1488720	is even more indescribably profane,
1488720	1493360	a room filled with city officials, judges, politicians,
1493360	1497640	celebrities lovingly referred to by its patrons
1497640	1500460	as the Den of Sin.
1500460	1504040	The Den of Sin offers more than just bloodsport.
1504040	1505960	It is torture.
1505960	1509720	Malnourished preteens are trapped in a hanging cage,
1509720	1511800	forced to fight to the death
1511800	1516720	as the ceiling lowers to meet the floor slowly but steadily.
1516720	1520600	In one such match, I witness the two gaunt children
1520600	1524460	hold hands in solidarity with each other,
1524460	1527040	accepting their demise.
1527040	1529700	The offended roar of the booing crowd
1529700	1532680	was quickly replaced with lustful cheers
1532680	1536720	as the hanging cage performed its singular trick
1536720	1540240	like a French press or a citrus juicer.
1540240	1542680	The Den of Sin earned its name
1542680	1546200	as the congregation of monsters flocked
1546640	1549800	to the metallic smelling dark red waterfall.
1550920	1553200	Well, I've somehow survived that mess.
1553200	1556380	A target on my back, sure, but that's just business.
1556380	1561000	However, I feel curiously out of my depth on this new case.
1561000	1564120	Most of us don't think about the small town of contention
1564120	1566240	about an hour west of here,
1566240	1569520	but it is recently proven we should pay attention.
1569520	1573440	By now, you may have heard about some of the disappearances
1573440	1575720	and the animal-filled creeks,
1575760	1577440	but what you may not know
1577440	1581440	is the chief of police recently contacted me, quote,
1581440	1586440	to open up the eyes and minds of those who live in the city.
1586920	1591140	She asked if I knew anything about the circle of knowledge,
1591140	1593760	Operation Sanfera Blum,
1593760	1595680	or the flowers that make their home
1595680	1598480	all over our downtown here in the city.
1598480	1601280	She asked if I knew anything about BarCorp,
1601280	1604360	its subsidiaries, or the Shell Corporation,
1604360	1606920	which owns the company, which owns the company,
1606920	1610480	which owns the company, which owns BarCorp.
1610480	1612640	She asked if I knew anything about the mill
1612640	1614720	on the other side of the city,
1614720	1618520	and she asked if I knew her father, Jim Cook.
1618520	1620560	So I began digging,
1620560	1623640	and I began following Jim Cook around the city.
1623640	1625840	That man can spot a tail,
1625840	1627520	but he couldn't spot whoever it was
1627520	1630320	that caught him in an alley two nights ago.
1630320	1632480	I'm worried I am next.
1632480	1634320	I'm even more worried that Maggie Cook
1634320	1637680	is now too spooked to speak on the record.
1637680	1640920	Chief Maggie Cook was passionate,
1640920	1643440	irate, and eager,
1643440	1646320	and then nothing.
1646320	1648880	We were supposed to meet in person last night,
1648880	1651840	December 2nd, no word.
1651840	1653440	I received a message this morning
1653440	1656960	changing the time and location of our meeting.
1656960	1659880	If I don't update the blog by tonight,
1659880	1662360	please begin the search by questioning
1662360	1665720	Contention Chief of Police, Maggie Cook.
1668920	1671240	So you guys' eyes look back up,
1671240	1673160	and Gary Daley's just like,
1674960	1679480	what the fuck does that mean?
1679480	1681480	I read this, and I was like, what?
1681480	1685200	Which part confuses you more,
1685200	1688240	the Denison stuff or the Maggie stuff?
1688240	1692400	Well, I assume that the city gets up to some weird stuff,
1692400	1694200	but here in Contention,
1694200	1696160	to have her connected to all those things
1696160	1699120	that it was talking about in here, I don't know.
1699120	1701680	No, we can pretty much tell you that,
1701680	1706560	yeah, that's all basically true.
1706560	1707920	What Maggie's involved in,
1707920	1711680	it goes way farther than Contention itself.
1711680	1715520	Guys, what is, like with the flowers
1715520	1717880	and all that in his blog post,
1718880	1721920	one of those myriad creatures was hollering at us
1721920	1725120	about that Samfaro Blom, I don't...
1725120	1726680	Keith, you pretended to know what it was,
1726680	1727880	and we didn't know what it was.
1727880	1730600	Clark, you've kind of been in touch with Maggie,
1730600	1731880	haven't you?
1731880	1733080	Yeah, yeah.
1733080	1735400	Has she said anything about her dad, or?
1735400	1737880	I mean, she showed me around her dad's house.
1738760	1740360	I was holding his book when she found me.
1740360	1743000	She asked why I was searching through her daddy's book.
1743000	1743840	I remember that.
1743840	1747160	She hasn't said much about Jim himself,
1747560	1748840	but just the stuff that we found
1748840	1752600	putting dots together in the carkled hole.
1752600	1754440	Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
1755080	1757240	It's just odd that he was following Jim around
1757240	1760440	and that Maggie said to open up the eyes of the city.
1760440	1760840	It just...
1762200	1766360	You know this bit here about Jim dying in an alley
1766360	1767560	two nights before?
1767560	1768060	Yeah.
1768680	1772440	We just found out, I believe it was his birthday,
1772440	1774360	December 1st, and every birthday,
1774360	1776680	he goes to that pie hole in the city.
1776760	1778760	So there's a chance we could figure out
1778760	1781160	if there's footage in the alley back there,
1781160	1784040	we might be able to see who got him.
1784040	1784760	That's true.
1784760	1785560	It's a great lead.
1786280	1789240	Well, I mean, what can we do?
1789240	1791720	Can we do anything with this information right now?
1791720	1794600	So it lines up with everything we've been kind of thinking, right?
1794600	1798200	That Jim Cook, he mentioned in that note
1798200	1799640	that he knew he had a tail.
1799640	1802200	It was a round face man with glasses or something like that,
1802200	1804840	which we all kind of at the time thought it was Harold.
1804840	1805880	So we figured that out.
1807160	1808680	Maggie was turning on Jim.
1808680	1811480	Maggie was spilling secrets to Harold about Jim.
1811480	1813240	That's what we've gathered from this.
1813240	1813640	Yeah.
1813640	1818600	Oh, and it said that she changed the time and location of their meeting.
1818600	1821240	They must have changed it to her house.
1821240	1824040	She changed it to her house from somewhere else, correct?
1825320	1826840	That's where you found Harold, right?
1826840	1829080	Harold was at Maggie's house.
1829080	1830440	And I couldn't save him.
1830440	1832600	He got a text that sent him to Maggie's house
1832600	1835240	instead of some other meeting place that they were going to meet.
1835240	1836680	I don't know what to do with that information,
1836680	1838440	but that's what I'm gathering here now.
1838440	1841320	Well, I mean, before we got down here,
1841320	1843320	we were kind of on our way to Maggie's house.
1843320	1844520	Yeah, we kind of were.
1844520	1847320	Yeah, Maggie's house is right on Bean's pond.
1847320	1850920	Do you think you could get us to the pond through these tunnels?
1850920	1851800	Well, yeah.
1851800	1854280	I can get you anywhere you want, basically.
1854280	1858680	Contingent is a mining town.
1858680	1862760	And they basically, when the mine shored up,
1862760	1864360	they took all the old tunnels
1864360	1866200	that they were using to get around,
1866200	1867720	and they bricked them all up
1867720	1871000	and made a very, very modern sewage system.
1871560	1875320	And so we can get pretty much anywhere we want around here
1875320	1877080	through them tunnels about there.
1877080	1880520	Well, we've been trying to get to the pond for a little while.
1880520	1881640	Like Ninja Turtles.
1882360	1884360	I'm Raphael, obviously.
1885400	1886680	Of course, of course.
1886680	1888760	You're whichever turtle you need to be.
1888760	1892520	So you're walking south through this tunnel for about five minutes
1892520	1895160	before you make it to an underground chamber
1895160	1900040	where Gary Daley and Harry Klinker have set up a makeshift campsite.
1900040	1903640	This room is square and roughly 30 yards across,
1904200	1908920	with four concrete columns placed evenly about 10 yards from each other.
1909480	1911480	The ground is mostly dry,
1911480	1913240	though there are puddles scattered about
1913240	1916120	where the concrete floor has eroded away a bit.
1916120	1919800	There are two tents on opposite ends of the room
1919880	1923320	and a luminous camping lantern lighting your view
1923320	1925000	from the very, very center of the room.
1925640	1929880	There is slight commotion by the far tent as you enter this space.
1930440	1933560	Mildred Mitchell, upon seeing your group,
1933560	1938360	is fleeing into the portable canvas shelter and zipping up the flap.
1938920	1945320	As a woman you do not recognize questions her from outside the outdoor domicile.
1945320	1950520	And you would remember Mildred Mitchell is the grandma of Toby B. Mitchell
1950520	1953160	who lived across from John Peters,
1953160	1958440	who I believe called in to say that John Peters' door was swinging open
1958440	1961400	and his mail was piling up in the first episode.
1962200	1964840	And just to remind listeners,
1964840	1966920	what is the significance of all that,
1966920	1970440	and could you tie any loose ends together there?
1970440	1976440	So you see her hop into this tent and a woman you don't recognize
1976440	1978280	is on the outside kind of questioning her,
1978280	1984600	but closer to you you see a man sitting up against one of the concrete columns reading a book.
1984600	1991160	And you recognize him as Casey Kristoff, the janitor of the First Church of Contention.
1991800	1995320	He has a pencil-thin mustache and a mullet.
1995320	1998360	His beer gut is spilling out of his Van Halen t-shirt
1998440	2000680	and over his cutoff shorts,
2000680	2004840	which has been his outfit of choice for the past 30 years.
2005560	2011080	Thanks to B. Weldon from Salt Lake City for Casey Kristoff.
2011080	2015400	You too can create an NPC in location that might get used in the show
2015400	2021320	if you support us on Patreon at the $10 level of the contention citizens or higher.
2021320	2024600	And then you see Harry Klinker sitting outside the nearest tent.
2025320	2027560	And as soon as you guys walk in there he stands up.
2027640	2029000	He's clearly relieved.
2029000	2032760	He's all over his face when he sees Gary in there with you guys.
2032760	2036520	And you all enter into this underground temporary home.
2036520	2039080	You should disconnect and reconnect.
2039080	2042520	I didn't want to stop your flow, but you're a super robot.
2042520	2044760	Like right as you started that you went super robot.
2045800	2046840	I will give it a go.
2046840	2048600	Okay, so how many tents are there?
2049400	2050040	Just one?
2050040	2051880	I think just one that she ran into.
2052520	2054520	Am I still a robot?
2054520	2055240	You're back!
2055240	2056200	Keep talking.
2056200	2059000	Am I still a robot with my mouth in my words?
2059000	2062360	Because when I talk I don't lightly swerve.
2062360	2064200	I swerve hard to the right.
2064200	2065960	Then I keep that shit up.
2065960	2069000	And I go in circles till I throw up.
2070120	2070620	Nice.
2071320	2073080	You ran up with up, but yeah.
2075480	2077320	Okay, so two tents.
2077320	2080680	One across the room from you where Mildred Mitchell hopped into.
2080680	2082920	And there was a woman standing outside.
2082920	2085960	And the other tent where Harry Klinker is sitting outside of.
2086040	2088280	He stood up to greet you as you walked in.
2088280	2089640	Hey boys, oh my god.
2089640	2091480	It's been a crazy couple days, no see.
2091480	2092280	It's good to see you.
2092280	2094840	Sorry, the other guy's name was Kristoff what?
2094840	2096040	Casey Kristoff.
2096040	2097560	Casey Kristoff, okay, sorry.
2097560	2099240	Oh my god, yes Harry.
2099240	2100360	I found them.
2100360	2101480	They were just, they were out there.
2101480	2104040	They'd wrecked and I mean it was coming for them.
2104040	2105480	Goo was coming for them, you know.
2105480	2108360	And thankfully they're here and we're fine.
2108360	2111000	I showed them the Dorsey block spot.
2111000	2113640	And yeah, we're just, oh boy.
2113640	2117800	So is this your guys' like home base down here or?
2117800	2122280	Yeah, we've been trying to hide from that old Pastor Adam Kane.
2122280	2127880	Really, really is not being very good to the people, you know.
2127880	2133800	Yeah, how many people do you think he's got on his side up there?
2133800	2134760	God, I don't know.
2134760	2137400	Maybe, maybe a hundred.
2137400	2139000	And what about you guys down here?
2139000	2140600	Is this all of us?
2140600	2147400	And Harry and Gary kind of look back at the three individuals down here,
2147400	2148760	one of which is hiding in a tent.
2149320	2151240	Yeah, this is, this is us.
2151880	2156520	I mean for now, we did have, we have a code outside of clinkers, you know.
2157080	2160680	If people can read it, it says tunnels and they can get down here.
2160680	2162120	What sort of code?
2162120	2164280	Well, it's a pretty fun code.
2164280	2167000	I just mean how do you keep bad folks from reading it?
2167000	2171480	They both look at each other and furrow their brows with like a panicked look.
2174120	2176760	So I, I recognize most of you down here.
2176760	2178040	Who, who's that?
2178040	2181880	And I kind of tilt my head at the lady I don't recognize.
2181880	2183080	Oh, that's Clara.
2183080	2184120	She's from the city.
2184120	2189000	How, how'd she get hooked up in this mess?
2189000	2192760	No, I mean you can ask her yourself, but she had some friends in contention.
2192760	2196280	She was hanging out with when all this started and she kind of got stuck here.
2196760	2198920	Where her, where her friends at?
2198920	2203320	Unfortunately, they, they got lost to, you know, Kane's movement.
2203320	2204360	Clara, Clara.
2204360	2213000	This attractive woman in her mid-40s looks over at you guys and she's got large tortoiseshell glasses
2213000	2221080	and as she walks up, you see that she has blood red lipstick and even though it's freezing cold
2221080	2227000	outside, she is wearing a sleeveless shirt and you see a full sleeve tattoo.
2227560	2232680	And the tattoo is of a robed figure holding a ball of light.
2234200	2241000	Clara Blankenship was created by Annie Beat, another citizen of contention over on the Patreon.
2241000	2241560	Super cool.
2241560	2242840	Annie, you are okay.
2246280	2249960	When I see her tattoo, I kind of look at the other two officers and
2249960	2251480	like kind of wide-eyed.
2251480	2253240	I, I wide-eyed back.
2253240	2255720	Guys, it's the cover of Led Zeppelin IV.
2257400	2259720	Doesn't that have a guy with sticks on it?
2260280	2262680	Did you guys just call me over here for-
2262680	2263320	Uh, yeah.
2264360	2265560	Hold on, I'm googling that.
2270440	2272920	What's, what's your deal, Clara?
2273720	2276520	That's a real interesting tattoo you got there.
2276520	2278360	Is that from any kind of Zeppelin album?
2278760	2282200	You know that Stairway to Heaven poster with the guy on the road with the light?
2282200	2286040	No, this is, this is based off a dream I had a few years ago.
2286040	2286920	About Zeppelin?
2286920	2289160	You guys have been having these crazy dreams, right?
2289160	2293480	I mean, I've been talking to everyone about him and we all seem to be having these absurd
2293480	2293960	dreams.
2293960	2299480	See, back then, this dream, it was just this, this robed figure with this ball of light
2299480	2304040	and he was walking just a long path and he was carrying this ball of light.
2304040	2308200	But recently, I've been having this dream where he's pulling the ball of light out of
2308200	2309000	a television?
2309560	2314760	It's, it's so weird because before, it was as if there was, you know, it was like all
2314760	2318840	dirt and stuff, so I didn't really expect technology to be a part of these dreams, but
2318840	2322120	you know, some people are having dreams that are in the modern world, some in the future
2322120	2326440	even, and you know, it's, it's just, have you, what are the dreams you, I assume you
2326440	2327320	guys have been having dreams.
2327320	2328520	How long have you been in contingent?
2328520	2331320	Just like out of that, that book, isn't it?
2331320	2331800	The book?
2331800	2332280	Which book?
2332280	2333560	I study a lot of occult books.
2333560	2335080	Is there a specific book you're talking about?
2335080	2336680	Looking at the two officers.
2336680	2338200	It's, it's similar for sure.
2338200	2342040	The, the, the thing we saw though, had the light emitting from a mouth.
2342040	2344120	It wasn't being held like an orb.
2344120	2347160	It's odd, but you've been having dreams about this.
2347160	2349720	I mean, everybody has weird dreams.
2349720	2352520	Harry over there told us you were in town visiting some friends.
2352520	2353400	Who were you visiting?
2353400	2354520	The Dudley's?
2354520	2355720	Just some friends of mine.
2355720	2358920	They were, unfortunately, they were persuaded.
2358920	2364920	They, see, they, they lost their cat to all this mess and unfortunately when, when they
2364920	2370360	were promised an option to, I don't know if you've heard, the pastor is saying he
2370360	2372840	can turn back time if you follow him.
2372840	2376680	So, you know, they, they really want their cat back.
2376680	2377720	They think that's the only way to...
2377720	2381320	Their cat's probably just in the river there with all the other cats and dogs.
2381320	2383960	Have we encountered the Dudley's before or is this new?
2383960	2385800	Uh, you would know, there's just some...
2385800	2387800	But we haven't like ran into them.
2387800	2388920	Not in the podcast, no.
2388920	2390760	They're just contention citizens.
2390760	2392040	Did you tell them to check the river?
2392040	2393960	That's where a lot of them are ending up.
2393960	2399800	Well, see, the issue is, is that yesterday the, the rivers were all emptied.
2399800	2405960	Uh, both the creek, the pond, everything was emptied by the collectors.
2405960	2411720	So they took all the animals back to the FCFC, which is what they're calling this bullshit
2411720	2411960	now.
2411960	2413560	Did they get their cat back then?
2413560	2414040	I don't know.
2414040	2414920	I haven't seen him since.
2414920	2416440	I'm not going behind that fish wall.
2416440	2417640	Are you kidding me?
2417640	2418840	Have you seen that shit?
2418840	2420840	I've got to let Murphy in real quick.
2420840	2422840	He's got to go behind the fish wall to get Murphy.
2423960	2439720	Gary and Harry, I mean, we were, uh, about to go investigate the pond.
2439720	2443880	Uh, I think there might be something at the bottom of it, but Claire, you said that all
2443880	2445240	the water got drained out of it.
2445240	2445960	Is that right?
2445960	2446440	Yeah.
2446440	2447640	I don't know how they did it.
2447640	2454200	I also don't know how there's a floating, like, wall of water surrounding the entire
2454200	2455080	campus of the church.
2455080	2459720	Well, I'm sure there's a solid explanation for it, and that's kind of what we're trying
2459720	2459880	to get to the bottom of.
2459880	2466120	I'm the head archivist and director of the City County Historical Commission, and I've
2466120	2471080	worked there for about 18 years, and I don't know if you've studied much history, but I
2471080	2473480	certainly, sorry, this kind of sounds like I'm being a dick.
2473480	2478280	I'm really trying not to be, but historically speaking, I don't remember this ever happening.
2478280	2481640	Yeah, but I mean, like, they do this kind of stuff all the time in Vegas.
2481640	2482200	Oh.
2482200	2482920	Bellagio.
2482920	2485480	It's a Bellagio sort of situation, I'd imagine.
2485480	2488520	Does the water normally stay up the whole time?
2488520	2490680	With lights and mirrors, yeah.
2490680	2491400	Magnets.
2491400	2492120	Wow.
2492120	2494040	I guess I need to go to Las Vegas then.
2494760	2496600	It's not all it's cracked up to be.
2496600	2500440	Hey, Zach, when you were describing Casey, and you said he was a janitor of the church,
2500440	2501960	do we know that in character?
2501960	2504120	Yeah, you would know that he's the janitor, yeah.
2504120	2505640	He's been the janitor for years.
2505640	2508200	I'd like to go over, talk to him too, if you want.
2508200	2510200	Okay, roll a humant for me right off the bat.
2510200	2510840	Can I help?
2510840	2512200	Are you all going over?
2512200	2513080	Yeah, I'm gonna go with him.
2514040	2514920	We'll bring Clara and Harry and Gary.
2514920	2516920	I mean, you don't have to disengage with Clara, I was just saying.
2516920	2518520	We'll call him over to us, I guess.
2519880	2521000	Uh, I failed.
2521000	2522360	A 92 on a 30.
2522360	2524520	37 on a 80.
2525240	2525960	Yeah, they'll do it.
2526520	2528120	He's not reading right now.
2528920	2535160	He's listening in, and he was very intrigued when this group of people walked in.
2535160	2539000	Also, Clark, what did you do with the body of Drew Carey?
2539000	2540120	I'm probably still holding it.
2540920	2542360	He's still over the top?
2542360	2547480	Okay, so Tyler's back paws are just like, his front paws are on your back,
2547480	2550760	and he's just like sniffing at Drew Carey this whole time,
2550760	2556520	and Jimmy Sanders is just like wandering kind of in circles around the room mumbling to himself.
2556920	2561240	I want to set Drew up against a pillar, and I don't know if it's a roll or not,
2561240	2562840	but try and see if I can revive.
2562840	2565000	Yeah, go ahead and roll first aid.
2568920	2569560	I pass.
2569560	2571480	A four on a 30.
2571480	2577400	Oh, yeah, I've got some smelling salts actually here for you there, Clark.
2577400	2579080	That's exactly what I could use, thank you.
2579080	2582600	Yeah, I was gonna ask, but I thought that that would be odd.
2582600	2584440	Yeah, just a passed roll.
2585000	2586600	You know, opens up all sorts of doors.
2594520	2595560	Carey, you with us?
2595560	2596040	You with us?
2596040	2596760	Yeah, hey.
2597400	2604840	And then just staring up at you and staring all around this room, Drew Carey is confused.
2604840	2607480	Carey, we died in the car crash and we're in hell.
2609080	2613000	We dragged you down here with us, and we turned Tyler into a hell dog,
2613000	2616360	and it's gonna nibble at your feet for all of eternity.
2619080	2626760	Tyler's just like licking Drew Carey's, you know, face and feet back and forth.
2626760	2628440	There's more where that came from.
2628440	2629960	Oh, hey there, Tyler.
2629960	2631160	Oh my God, it's so good.
2631720	2635240	And Drew starts crying, and it's just like, thank you.
2635240	2638520	Oh my God, thank you so much for keeping him safe.
2639080	2640280	I lead the dog off.
2640280	2642840	If you don't mind, I'd just like to talk to my dog, please.
2642840	2643720	Thank you very much.
2643720	2646280	You can talk to Tyler after you answer some of our questions.
2646280	2647400	Boys, can you help me out here?
2649320	2650120	Tyler, shut up.
2650120	2650520	Tyler!
2659240	2664760	If you're listening, write in an NPC with like special powers and they can help us.
2664760	2672600	This is Bubba Jenkins and he knows everything.
2672600	2674680	You can ask him anything and he knows the answer.
2676840	2683240	Clara Blankenship, this NPC from Annie B was the first NPC sent in.
2684120	2692200	And I believe in the description, it did say that she owns all of Silas Cole's journals.
2694840	2696360	Okay, so she was trying to help us.
2696360	2698040	She literally did exactly that.
2701320	2702520	That's great.
2702520	2703320	That's really funny.
2703320	2705080	Was the tattoo written in on there too?
2705080	2706360	The tattoo was on there, yeah.
2706360	2706760	Cool.
2706760	2707240	I love it.
2713640	2714840	Oh, who's a good boy?
2714840	2715640	Who's a good boy?
2715640	2716840	I love you, Tyler.
2716840	2718920	Carrie, you took a big hit back there.
2718920	2720600	Are you feeling all right?
2720600	2723480	No, not at all, but it doesn't even matter.
2723480	2724280	Everything is fine.
2724280	2724760	Thank you.
2725320	2729560	Now that the love of my life is here with me and everything is fine.
2729560	2733080	Your original mission was to bring us back to the church, is that right?
2733080	2733480	Yes.
2733480	2737960	And was that with the explicit purpose of getting Keith back to the church or was it
2737960	2739240	all three of us at that point?
2739240	2744680	Well, I mean, he doesn't want you alive, Clark.
2744680	2750520	And John, even though you're not technically John, I believe, thank you very much.
2750520	2755240	I think that, you know, you're John inside of your dad and that's fine.
2755240	2761160	But you two, you three technically are responsible for the death of his family.
2761880	2766680	I don't know if you were aware of that when you just crashed a car and then bailed out
2766680	2767800	of our town.
2767800	2769000	That's not what happened.
2769000	2777160	We told a very reliable canine entity to tell the town people what was going on while we
2777160	2777640	were gone.
2778440	2781240	Now, if that didn't get communicated to the town, I'm sorry.
2781240	2783480	I'm sorry, but we sent it into the station.
2783480	2785960	You think I don't listen to 694.2?
2785960	2786920	Have you heard Kudzu?
2790680	2792280	That new song is a real banger.
2793160	2796440	I just played this morning for the first time and it blew me away.
2796440	2801080	Okay, well, Kerry, we might have you just stay here until we go to the-
2801080	2802520	Why do you keep calling him Kerry?
2802520	2809800	That's Councilwoman Kerry Pages who used the magic slash haunted radio to swap bodies
2810760	2813800	with our good friend, Ru.
2813800	2817880	I don't know who you guys are all looking at, but all of their eyes are very wide right
2817880	2818380	now.
2820200	2826680	She's been working with a pastor trying to trick us into going back to the church, but
2826680	2828200	we figured her out.
2828200	2837640	And if y'all don't still believe us, why would Councilwoman Pages' dog Tyler run up to Drew
2837640	2838520	Andrews?
2838520	2839640	Yeah, see, exactly.
2839640	2842040	It's like dogs only like one person.
2842040	2843560	I dramatically let the dog go.
2847000	2855000	In the style of those movies where the young boy and the evil guy of the movie are on opposite
2855000	2860760	sides of a dog and they're both calling to it, it goes to the, I guess, the evil person
2860760	2863240	in this situation, technically, from your perspective.
2864280	2869800	But Tyler runs to the body of Drew Andrews and Kerry Pages grabs it around the neck once
2869800	2870600	more.
2870600	2872360	Oh my God, yes, Tyler.
2872360	2872920	I love you.
2872920	2873560	I love you.
2873560	2874760	And it's like, thank you.
2874760	2875480	Thank you, John.
2875480	2879480	I know you didn't want to do that, but it's just, this is my everything.
2880120	2883000	Harry, it's just that everything is fucked.
2883000	2885160	You know how we thought that most things were fucked?
2885160	2886760	It seems that everything is fucked.
2887400	2888680	Yeah, yeah.
2888680	2894120	Yeah, Gary, you've always been kind of open to the idea that things were hinky in the
2894120	2894920	world, weren't you?
2894920	2896360	Yeah, it's a great word for it.
2896360	2898520	Is this ticking off any boxes?
2898520	2902120	Like, oh yeah, I read about when body switching happened in that one book.
2902120	2905720	Is this ringing any bells in any of your research or anything?
2905720	2906840	How about goo?
2906840	2908920	Was goo on your radar before today?
2908920	2912440	Does this remind you of a certain Lindsay Lohan movie?
2912440	2915560	Or perhaps have you researched the works of Silas Cole?
2915560	2917880	That's a lot of questions all at once, fellas.
2917880	2925000	And you know, I'm into a lot of this here stuff, but you know, I've seen some actual
2925000	2926600	magic in my life.
2926600	2931320	So yeah, I mean, I knew that this was all part of this.
2931320	2936040	I mean, you'll remember the conversation we had on the phone when you were on the way
2936040	2936680	to the city.
2936680	2937480	How could we forget?
2938360	2941400	It was your grandfather?
2941400	2943880	Was it grandfather or father gave him the spell?
2943880	2945480	Well, my grandfather gave me the book.
2945480	2948200	It had, you know, three pages left in it.
2948840	2951320	And they were specifically for the three of you.
2951320	2955720	And boy, those words danced off light like the page and just lit like a fire.
2955720	2958360	Are there any of those pages left or was...
2958920	2959960	Well, no.
2959960	2965080	There were three in there for us and it burnt out in the spell that he did over our heads.
2965080	2966040	Because there's three of us.
2966040	2966920	That makes sense.
2966920	2968920	Hey, why wasn't there a page for Justin?
2968920	2969800	Who's Justin?
2970440	2971080	Never mind.
2971080	2974040	You think there weren't a bunch of pages that created Wolf the dog?
2979000	2979560	Good point.
2980840	2982520	No, there were only three when I got it.
2982520	2984200	It was very thick, very thick.
2984200	2987000	But when you'd open it up, you could only get to like three pages.
2987640	2989880	And then once they were gone, it was just empty.
2989880	2993080	It was just shell on both sides, but it was still full.
2993080	2995640	It looked like a book, but there's nothing in there.
2995640	2999160	We found a book that will only open to one page.
2999160	3000920	Kind of looks like her tattoo.
3000920	3002040	The page that it opens up to.
3002040	3005000	The book itself, it was maybe skin bound.
3005000	3007960	Was the book you had bound by perhaps skin?
3007960	3009240	Man skin.
3009240	3013080	The face of Gary Daley loses blood.
3014680	3016440	Yeah, I sure didn't like touching that book.
3016440	3018280	I wanted to get rid of it as fast as I could.
3018920	3021320	You got it from your grandfather?
3021320	3021960	Yeah.
3021960	3024280	Yeah, when the pages were gone, what did you do with it?
3024280	3026600	Well, I don't.
3027720	3029320	Did you give it to Clark's parents?
3031880	3033160	And Gary starts crying.
3033720	3036920	Clark, we found it in Jim's house.
3036920	3038600	It would have been Jim, right?
3038600	3041080	That you gave it to if you give it to anybody.
3041080	3043560	No, I haven't really mentioned to you in all the hubbub,
3044120	3049160	what with the dog and the body switching and, you know, the fish magic.
3049160	3053240	I'm just imagining all the NPCs encircling you while you're having this conversation.
3054440	3055560	Sorry, what was that?
3055560	3061240	When I was having my augury, as it was, and I saw that
3062760	3066440	the entity before us that pretends to be Drew cannot be trusted.
3067400	3073960	When I saw that, I also saw a vision of Kacelle searching your parents' home for that book.
3074920	3078520	And Karen and Jim seemed to want it desperately.
3079320	3083480	But Kevin found it and he didn't reveal it to the others.
3084600	3086040	That's all I saw.
3086040	3087160	Do you know where it is now?
3088040	3089480	Clark, I'm so sorry.
3091480	3097000	I knew how much power it had, but I didn't know that people were going to be after it
3097000	3098040	the way they were.
3098040	3102040	And I think they died because I gave it to them.
3103480	3108760	Clark is staring at Gary with a little bit of anger and a little bit of confusion.
3109560	3112120	Like this is really hitting some notes.
3112200	3118040	I didn't, I didn't mean to, I didn't mean to cause their death or nothing.
3118040	3121080	I just, I knew I needed to get rid of it because I didn't.
3121080	3127160	I don't remember much about that day, but I do remember I heard, I heard a voice and
3128200	3130280	they did, they said something about Karen.
3130280	3133720	Karen, they said Karen did a magic trick and they all had to get out of there.
3134680	3137880	And that's, that was the last time I,
3137880	3142760	I don't, I don't understand though.
3142760	3145400	I don't, why did you, why would you give them a book like that?
3145400	3147640	Why would you think that they would want a book like that?
3147640	3149160	They were customers.
3149160	3151480	They were at the Daily Foam almost daily.
3151480	3155000	And they always asked about the signs up on the wall.
3155000	3161320	And we would talk often about, you know, conspiracy theories and occult texts.
3161320	3163400	And they seem knowledgeable about that.
3163400	3167240	No, they were just, they just had a passing interest, I think.
3167240	3169320	Why did you need to give it to them?
3169320	3171880	It was a book made out of a human.
3171880	3172760	I didn't want it.
3173480	3175400	And my parents did, did they take it?
3175400	3177480	Did, did they, did they take the book?
3177480	3179400	Like, did they know what they had?
3179400	3185320	Did they, did they seem, did they seem gleeful in having it or was it just a curiosity for them?
3185320	3187240	I don't remember seeing it in the house personally.
3187240	3190120	So they obviously secreted it away or something.
3190120	3192680	Well, it seemed to be a curiosity.
3192760	3199480	But when I told them, I mean, I told them what it could do.
3200200	3204440	So they knew, they knew the power that it had if they actually trusted me.
3204440	3205320	What could it do?
3205320	3207880	Yeah, you said the pages were empty, right?
3207880	3209240	They couldn't do anything anymore, right?
3209240	3214280	Well, I mean, they knew what it had been capable of doing previous, I suppose.
3214280	3216120	Can I human Gary here?
3216120	3217960	Yeah, you both want to roll?
3217960	3218460	Sure.
3218460	3224860	I fail 71 on a 30.
3225580	3227020	75 on a 50.
3227020	3227740	Fuck.
3227740	3228780	Seems genuine to you guys.
3229580	3230860	Coming across as genuine.
3230860	3232620	I don't cheat on my rolls, motherfucker.
3233740	3235260	No, I was talking about Gary.
3235260	3235760	Oh.
3238220	3240700	I knew exactly how to, now I get what you meant.
3240700	3241900	Also, you said you failed.
3242780	3243260	Bullshit.
3243260	3243760	I know.
3246220	3247020	Fucking liar.
3248460	3251500	I've seen Luke take too long to think about what he writes sometimes.
3255580	3258700	Gary, it's your grandfather's book.
3258700	3259580	Do you know where he got it?
3259580	3261660	What was your grandfather's name, by the way?
3261660	3263100	Well, I'd have to look that up.
3265020	3266140	Can I human that?
3268220	3269260	That's not in there.
3269260	3270620	That's not in the podcast.
3270620	3271120	Fuck.
3271660	3273340	I don't know if I ever said it.
3273340	3275100	Oh, you mean in the vision?
3275100	3275740	Yeah.
3275740	3276540	You didn't say it.
3276540	3277820	You just said grandfather.
3277820	3280700	His name was, um, Gary?
3281740	3282700	Grant Father.
3284940	3287740	His name was Grant Father Bailey.
3291740	3293980	And you don't know where he got that?
3293980	3296380	Where, you know where old Grant got that book?
3297100	3301900	Well, uh, we all, I mean, we all thought he was pretty crazy, but.
3301900	3305020	And he looks over at Clara Blankenship's arm.
3305900	3307820	You see that figure right there?
3307820	3311820	That looks to be about what he described that dropped it off at the Daily Fuh.
3311820	3313100	After closing time.
3313100	3313980	Can you imagine that?
3313980	3315020	Didn't even buy anything.
3316060	3317980	Some people are just rude.
3319020	3322940	You don't know if it's a bad day, a bad, uh, bad childhood.
3322940	3325180	It's like, he has no respect for other people's time.
3329340	3331500	I don't know anybody with the problem with that.
3331500	3332000	Blind.
3332000	3336720	So does that, does that tattoo ring a bell for anybody?
3336720	3338240	Have you ever seen anything like that?
3338240	3338640	Yeah.
3338640	3344640	Weird man who I took to be some sort of robot at the time approached me, uh, uh, outside
3344640	3349680	the hospital after I went to follow up on some, some lead, it seems like years ago now.
3350880	3354640	I remember that he gave you that note that was in binary, right?
3354640	3355120	Yeah.
3355120	3358640	And it said, uh, John, I killed the cheese pops.
3358640	3360000	He was rogue like that?
3360000	3360880	He sure was.
3362080	3365680	I guess it was just cause it was in binary that I assumed it was mechanical.
3365680	3370640	Uh, and then he, then he said, say hi to me for me.
3371440	3373200	Do you reckon that might've been old Clark?
3374160	3377520	We've certainly seen old me in robes.
3377520	3381520	That's that's when, when he did that thing in the mausoleum, he was wearing a robe.
3381520	3384480	John like jots down suspect has been seen in robes.
3385200	3395520	But that would, that would mean that I, when I was, when I was a kid, Gary, Gary, you were
3395520	3396080	there.
3396080	3396640	What?
3396640	3398320	When I was a kid, I came to visit mr.
3398320	3401920	Fingersen at the library and you were there and you were reading a book.
3402720	3405200	And when you read from the book, do you remember this?
3405200	3405600	Okay.
3405600	3407120	No, it was not my fault.
3407120	3408720	I stand by that though.
3408720	3410320	The book of, you know, St.
3410880	3415440	Oscythe witches or whatever I was reading that day does not have anything to do with
3415440	3417840	any cloaked figures except for witches.
3417840	3421840	You know, obviously sometimes we're cloaks, but either way, Gary, whether you did it or
3421840	3425200	not, which I think you did, but whether you did it or not, you were there.
3425200	3427520	And we saw that you remember that there was a cloak.
3427520	3428480	There was a cloak man.
3428480	3433440	He, he locked up the doors to the library and he was, he was being chased or chasing
3433440	3433920	someone.
3433920	3438160	He goes like, he's going to grab onto Clara Blankenship's arm to look closer at the
3438160	3438560	tattoo.
3438560	3440320	And then he's like, Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
3440320	3443680	I did not mean to touch your arm to look at your tattoo.
3443680	3444960	That would be extremely rude.
3444960	3446720	Can I just look at that much closer?
3446720	3448400	And she's like, yeah, of course, that's fine.
3448400	3451120	And very closely puts his face right up to her arm.
3451120	3455680	This motherfucker right here is exactly who was outside the Mary Cole public library
3455680	3456000	that day.
3456000	3457200	I swear to God.
3457200	3460560	And thankfully that figure locked us in, right?
3460560	3460880	Yeah.
3460880	3464560	He used some sort of chains or something because there were these big tall creatures.
3465200	3466240	Oh my goodness.
3466240	3468320	I'm having all sorts of flashbacks right now.
3468320	3469360	Yeah, they were wearing suits.
3469360	3472560	They were these lanky translucent skin fuckers.
3472560	3476320	I told John they, they, they were, they were the, they were the, they were those creatures.
3476320	3479360	I remember now it was the, it was the thing that's been yelling at us.
3480480	3482560	They were chasing the robed figure.
3482560	3484800	And now you're saying that that could be old me.
3485600	3486000	I don't know.
3487280	3488560	I turned to Clara.
3488560	3489520	I am so sorry.
3489520	3494400	I know you guys are having like a whole thing right now and it seems, seems really important.
3495280	3500800	But I, if I can, since the figure that you're talking about was in my dreams and has been
3500800	3507680	in my recurring dreams for the past few years and a long time now, I have this video that
3507680	3510800	I found online from this dude in contention way back when.
3510800	3516720	And since it's been scrubbed from the internet and I'm pretty sure that like some sort of
3516720	3521840	black ops special secret service kind of like men in black shit took it off the internet
3521840	3523680	because I looked him up recently.
3523680	3524960	I think he disappeared.
3526160	3526800	Whose video?
3526800	3528080	His name's John Peters.
3530560	3531840	It's this YouTube video.
3531840	3536080	He used to have a channel where he talked about the dreams he had during this coma that
3536080	3538240	he was in for like a while.
3538240	3540080	He was in the hospital for an extended time.
3540080	3541840	Could be any John Peters in a coma.

3568240	3574480	Welcome back to John Peters channel where I'm talking about my visions that I saw while
3574480	3579840	having a over a month long coma here in contention.
3580880	3589760	I believe these visions showed me a world or a land that is parallel to our own simultaneously
3589760	3590640	existing.
3590640	3599680	I was led there by a man who only carried a black Nike bag and when he reached out to
3599680	3609520	shake my hand upon introductions, it smelled of sweet meats like a grill and my hand burned
3609520	3610480	and burned.
3611680	3613280	That is all for now.

3624400	3626720	Do y'all remember that motherfucker having such big eyes?
3660480	3663600	The only one trying to
3669840	3673600	try
3689680	3691600	to
