132740	136100	Y'all ever tasted sour cream and thought to yourself
136620	142820	The amount of sour in this cream is not nearly enough for one such as I so
143180	147460	You let it sit in the jar outside for a few days now
147460	153100	That's some sour shit and a little chunky, you know old wolf loves his crystals
153100	156300	But in the words of the Queen Jada essence hall
157140	160380	Misdirection herself look over there. It's the news
161260	167780	Last time lots of information was shared and then Keith went berserk on little old
168220	173700	Mildred Mitchell John kicked things off by telling the group about his uncle
173700	177980	Don D. Pettymore who could burn folks with his hands
178020	182300	John also recalled being chased by two tall gaunt
182540	190140	Fancy men in suits while being pushed in a wheelchair by Uncle Don Keith also remembered seeing those lemmy
190860	196620	Translucent fellas infiltrate his father's estate the day Ferguson was given the watch
197060	204220	John put the watch on and saw his daddy steal him the vector and adopted baby from the Kane
204540	206500	Family burning down their house
206500	213460	But unaware of Adam Kane's survival Keith slapped the watch on and saw John murder him and
213660	218340	Clark in order to take the watch and walk down into beans pond
218660	224900	But the watch didn't come off his wrist when he came back to reality and he became real
225540	227060	suspicious of John
227060	233260	Shit got heated with Mildred Mitchell blaming the three PCs for her granddaughter Tilly B's
233820	236900	Disappearance showed them a picture of the founders of
237460	242920	contention the face of Silas Cole had settled on the face of Keith Vigna and a
243100	249900	Reflection in the glass looked a whole lot like that miss until DB Keith lost it and Keith did up
250340	255300	Grinding the old stoner into the old stone ground. This was a step too far
255820	262980	Harry and Gary asked them to leave at gunpoint and the three headed south into a tunnel and toward
263300	264500	beanspond
264500	265460	Never mind
265460	272620	They completely ignored the spell that fell out of Mildred Mitchell's back pocket as well as the fact that Casey
272980	278700	Kristoff the longtime janitor of the first Church of contention was clearly
279340	286620	Eavesdropping instead of reading his book. It'd be a shame if old Casey wasn't actually down there in the sewers to avoid
287380	290060	Big Daddy Kane, but rather doing
290660	296880	Reconnaissance for his employer. Well, what do I know? I'm just here to deliver you a brand new song
297460	303040	premiering shit non-stop every week or day or a few hours or like
303260	305680	25 minutes in game time or even sometimes
306380	310060	In the past and hopefully in season 2 or whatever
310540	315860	This one's new when it's just for you. It's kazoo with no backbone
321060	323060	You
346100	348640	Thanks for having me yeah problem Joe, yeah
348640	352600	Thanks for having all of us Luke. I understand you've been playing Crusader Kings. I have
353720	358880	Zach your couch is pretty comfy and Ramona is sleeping on top of the other one and she's very cute
359080	363920	Luke's internet hasn't been working. So we're using lots of hand sanitizer and
365360	368640	Keeping him just in the living room. Yep
369720	371160	I'm here
371160	376640	Ramona likes the smell of the germ X she likes to I was petting her but she kept wanting to lick my hands
377160	384020	Well, don't let my cat lick the poison off of your she does she's not gonna have any germs in her mouth by the end of
384020	386020	the night
386840	393480	Zach the president implied that things like this are not only fine, but beneficial. So oh well
393480	398420	Oh God, he also said if we stop testing the numbers will be very low
400480	404440	Which is true. Yeah, it's been proven, correct
407040	411480	Yep, welcome to hell world fuckheads. Oh
414400	420840	You thought you were gonna get away from the world by listening to a role-playing podcast we've all been touched by the devil hands
426200	428440	Don D. Petty more patient zero
429600	433480	God-dang Don D. Don D. I wonder when he'll show up
434160	439620	Yeah, so much happened last episode that I kind of forgot that that's where we started was a man who could burn other people with
439620	441620	his bare hands I
442660	445960	Thomas and I hadn't talked about the past of that and
446680	452220	Hearing that it was just a staple in their childhood camping trips was pretty horrifying to hear
453960	460600	It's like I'm trying to think of like anything my family or like like a weird trick and uncle can do or something
460600	466200	But nothing really matches. Yeah, my uncle can pull his thumb clean off. He puts it right back
467000	473200	My uncle that's so on multiple occasions has stolen my nose off of my face
473200	478300	Oh shit, but it's he always puts it back sometimes not right away, which is scary, but
480800	484880	He lost it one time we had to look all around it was in the couch
485600	487080	Yeah
487080	488120	uncle
488120	493880	Dave all uncles are Dave all uncles are Dave. I have one uncle Dave. I have an uncle Dave
493880	499560	I have an uncle Dave. Really? I have two uncles named Dave. You got a Jimmy and I got a Jimmy
499560	501920	So maybe they're all Jimmy. Oh, I've got a Jimmy to
502560	507000	Story. Yeah, me too. My uncle Donny's name is Jimmy now. I
508480	512160	Renamed Dave who didn't exist in the first place. Welcome to 84
512600	519800	Pretending to be people where everybody's uncle has a name. Wait, how many uncles do you have just on your dad's side?
523720	525720	Six and how many else
526440	531480	Yeah, I just won wait, but they all live together. Yeah. No, they did it one point
531680	536640	They actually didn't their ages were so like the oldest to the youngest I think is an 18 year difference
536800	540240	So they'd weren't ever in the house all at the same time. I don't think oh
540240	545480	Can you imagine getting rid of one and then there's just a new one all the sudden there about yeah
545480	550240	Their numbers didn't change at all. Definitely after the first one like grew up a little bit
550240	553760	They were like, oh shit. These things are handy if you teach them how to like
557480	562920	18 years of like fresh kids definitely seems like some kind of forced labor program or like
564120	566120	Something they were getting out of it
566800	570200	Not joy or love you can get that one, too
572720	574720	How do ants get made
580520	582520	In pursuit of an ant
583340	589460	Wait wouldn't if your uncle fucked your grandma you would get you get you get a grant grandpa
589520	593160	Well, no, we only discuss you get another you get an aunt you get an aunt
594000	597640	If your uncle fucked your grandpa then you'd get another mom
598720	600720	All right, you you would get another
601600	604500	Grandma, cuz if you fuck your dad you get a mom
604800	610280	So if your uncle fucked your grandpa by the trans you would get a grandma another grandma
610280	614600	I was never good at biology in school. So I don't know if this really checks out. It's like
615480	620400	And recessive jeans and stuff. Yeah, you have to look at the Punnett Square. Yeah
621400	623400	Invented by
624360	626360	Who's who is that guy
630280	635300	Recessive gene and a dominant gene and Taylor has two recessive genes
635640	638920	Then when we have sex, we'll get a great-grandma
640000	642000	correct
642640	644640	What was that now I got to figure out
645520	651320	Who's the guy that figured that out his name was something he was like a monk or a priest or something
651320	658240	I bet Thomas will be upset that you had to google it. What who discovered recessive genes Thomas was it Mendel?
658240	665700	Yep, Gregory. Yeah, Mendel men who actually I don't know if you guys knew this same guy is Rasputin people
665700	669320	Don't know that but he's the same guy. It's the exact same guy
669320	672600	Yeah, he just went by Gregory when he was doing science
676840	683920	Close enough for me. Have you guys been watching the great on Hulu never heard of it? No, I hear it's good though
683920	687960	It's really good. It's it's the guy who did the or the people who did the favorite?
687960	693080	So it's a lot of that movie rule same sense of humor style, and I don't know what the favorite is
693840	700120	Who knows your guys Lanthimos is last movie with oh I did see that that was really good. Yeah, Emma Stone and
700800	704040	Holly Coleman leak Peaky Blinders. Yeah, I'll be sure
704800	707040	Paulie Shore and Nicholas Holt
707880	712800	So Nicholas Holt is that there's one of the main characters in the in the great and he's fucking great in it
712960	719420	It's a really surprisingly. So I was a big skins UK fan when I was it. Oh, is that
720300	724620	What's the code Tony Tony stolen yes season one Tony
725100	733220	Alright, so Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore the third they're walking down this tunnel having just been essentially forced out of this room
733300	737500	By the only two people you've been able to trust and contention thus far
738020	745260	Essentially, yeah, that didn't feel too good you catch up and you see Keith Vigna on the right side of this tunnel again
745260	747260	This is an arched
747340	754180	Very Ninja Turtles arched roof above you with a pathway on the right pathway on the left and then sewage sludge
754820	758420	Slowly moving in the middle. You see me on the right side
758420	765980	I'm on my back and I've got my left hand that has the watch on it and I've got both my feet on
766560	771460	my arm just trying to like pry the watch off my wrist and
772020	776980	I'm crying and he's crying because you can see the scrape of skin coming off
777260	781140	and blood and I'm also he's also crying cuz he
782060	787580	Potentially just killed someone Keith Keith Keith Keith calm down buddy. Hold on
787580	792560	No, I got this is just fucking I know we got to get it off, but that's not working. Look at that
792560	797300	That's not like you're hurting yourself there Keith. It hurts. It does. I just we're gonna get it off
797660	799740	We're gonna get it off. Was she was she?
799740	801740	I
801740	806020	Still breathing when we left Keith, okay. Can you are you sure?
806820	808620	Yeah, we're sure
808620	809820	Why?
809820	811820	Why did you do that? I?
812740	817700	Don't know. I thought maybe she had something to do with this being stuck on it
817700	824180	I don't I just don't think straight when shit like this happens anymore. I can understand that
824660	828300	Think things will set us off at the drop of a hat these days. It seems like
828980	833440	We've seen a lot. We've seen a lot in the last few days on are you still gonna shoot us when we get there?
833960	837460	Maybe man, I don't know. I got two guns now, though
838820	845680	Okay, listen, all I'm saying is you you do some crazy shit you attack, you know an old lady that we find there
846180	848940	yeah, maybe I'm gonna have to shoot you but if you fucking just
849700	855540	Okay, well maybe you can you walk in front me and Clark can walk behind you just to make me feel better
856260	861260	Absolutely. Are we I don't even know if we're going the right way. I I get in front of them
861260	863260	But then I turn around with gun strong
866540	870900	Just what just playing just plants that's not very funny John a people
870900	875260	He's got you know, it's a tense situation. Somebody's got to diffuse it a little bit
875620	881900	So I've livened things up get get get a little get a little joy in our heart after you beat that old woman half to
881900	883900	death fucking psychopath
884700	889940	It wasn't really me. It was I don't know something in me. Just I
890740	893340	Didn't I didn't want to do it. I didn't mean to but
894940	897360	Let's just get let's just get to the fucking pond
897860	902580	Gary said we were we were heading in the right direction you that you happen to pick the right tunnel to to crawl
902580	906900	Good it's probably cuz I'm the Savior and I just have that kind of intuition now
908620	912020	Sure, all right, I pet you on the back I roll my eyes at Clark
912020	915620	Yeah, I roll I roll back as I'm patting you on the back. Yeah, that's it
916260	918260	You nailed it
919060	920260	Yes
920260	924760	Would while we're walking there would this be a good time to discuss something?
924760	927860	we haven't really talked a whole lot about we found out that we
928380	930380	You know kind of
931380	933380	Maybe from one point of view
933580	935580	from a certain perspective
935860	940820	Might have let Adam Cain's wife and his children burn to a little crisp in a minivan
940820	945260	I mean we we just ran that help we tried to help
945260	949620	I know but it doesn't seem like people think we did it seems like they really think we just
950260	956080	Let them burn up and then we left town. We can a Adam Cain you what you're technically his
957080	962720	A kind of his brother. Yeah, we've now learned that his entire family was killed and he was a sole survivor
963640	965640	because of Kevin's slobiness
966040	970840	Or perhaps ill ill got it. Sorry Murphy's going crazy. So good. Gotta stop him
970840	973400	You can hear Tyler from back the way you came
974120	976040	yelping out
976040	980600	Tyler did like us Keith hops in the sewage and starts splashing around
983240	985360	Keith roll Constitution
987080	989080	To not get gonorrhea
989160	995960	No, what do you get from from poop? Maybe like E. Coli or pink eye pink eye or
996800	1002200	What's something else you can get what happens if you eat poop Thomas? What happens if you eat poop?
1002200	1009360	I think that depends on the poop a lot of people do ingest other people's poop to improve their gut biome
1009360	1014640	Oh, I thought they shot it up their butts like a like a like a tall boy. They make little poop pills
1014720	1019600	No way according to Illinois Poison Center eating poop is minimally toxic
1021440	1023440	So I think
1023760	1028920	You should eat poop. That's also is that core prophagia, huh? Is that what it's called?
1028920	1033400	It was enough syllables to be right co prophagia. Let's get back to the convert
1033400	1040520	What were we talking about out of character when John you were telling us the story the the canes also adopted you, right?
1040520	1046360	Like right I had been a yeah, it's so first exactly and Kevin stole me because
1046920	1051320	He and my my my saintly mother were trying to have a baby and could not conceive
1052200	1058320	Gotcha, and so God saw fit to put me a child of destiny and ball in front of him
1058960	1063680	Because I am the Savior we did we did try to save Adams family in that wreck
1063680	1068720	I obviously didn't go to according to plan but we tried and there was a crowd around there that saw us trying to help
1068760	1073720	I think John you might have scared him off with a couple gunshots, but they saw that we were helping I
1074600	1075880	Don't think that's you know
1075880	1083120	Cuz the the person we've been around who's been close to Adam was was Carrie in the body of Drew and the story
1083120	1090480	She told us seems like Adam Kane and the town's version of things right now is that we let them die and then left town
1090880	1098280	Yeah, that's sucks for him that he's lost two families in a horrible horrific fire
1098720	1099640	accident
1099640	1105960	Well, maybe not accident for the first it certainly adds a layer of terror to that memories. Yeah
1106600	1109460	guys, I tried my hardest to keep it from happening, but
1113680	1116360	Well also so we've
1120760	1127760	Valiantly if I remember guys, we've also all had have we all had encounters with those crazy
1128560	1131720	Creatures before I mean Marvin things
1131720	1136200	I I mean like I told you guys before I got this watch stuck on me that I
1136520	1139240	Saw three of them at least when I was a kid
1139680	1145620	In my in my yard before before my dad gave this watch to my brother in my memory
1145620	1152700	It was a they were chasing the I I would say a rogue figure but these days it's the road figure
1152700	1156080	I think it's the same one. We've been seeing it might be old me
1156080	1162000	I think it's old me that people seem to think it's old bar called Clark old and they were chasing you after your after your
1162120	1168600	Accident John. Well, yeah that the last day of my racing career is kind of one big concussed blur
1169200	1172720	But as far as I remember it, yeah
1172720	1180520	They started chasing me and Don D that day these things have known something about us long before we ever did
1180560	1185280	Yeah, maybe so they were they were targeting each of us and mine was I was only
1185800	1188840	Forwarded by old me. He put chains around the library door
1188840	1194040	That's where I was in the library and he put chains around the door and then took maybe he took the heat off of Mary
1198240	1201920	On the front it says the Mary Cole Public Library
1210960	1216000	It it seems like the yeah those those men those those those creatures in suits
1216000	1220480	They were after after each of us and it sounds like I gotta have Justin change the map
1223120	1224960	Well shit I
1224960	1228400	How all this is just all the shits happened so fast
1228400	1231360	I don't know what I don't know what to think about any of it
1231360	1236640	Don't you done this all like then propose the idea that we're pawns in something else's game
1236760	1242720	There was a there was some old man that told Gary that gave Gary Daley's grandfather a book and told him to put a spell
1242720	1246360	on us, I don't know I mean and then these things were chasing us and
1246880	1249080	Maybe you two are pawns, you know
1249600	1254200	Gary just showed us that thing that Harold Dorsey wrote and you know
1254200	1261520	We saw that John Peters thing in Harold's thing. It says that you know, Maggie was trying to tip him off
1262120	1267920	Do you think you know, maybe she knows more about this than she lets on or oh
1268920	1274760	Certainly Maggie knows a lot more than she lets on perhaps except maybe to you Clark. I mean, I don't
1275480	1281400	Whether or not we believe everything she said I think I've told you everything that she told me that there's the possibility now that
1281400	1285360	It's either not the Maggie that we knew or it's it is a Maggie
1285360	1290120	We knew and she maybe hurt the one that we didn't know or I don't know. I don't know what's going on now
1290640	1294680	I think we may need to get a hold of her before we go to
1295880	1300840	Confront Kane. I don't even know what we're gonna do about that. We've certainly got a lot to think about
1300920	1305320	Let's just do one thing at a time. There's a giant spider on my keyboard right now
1313080	1315920	Yeah, John rolls his eyes your keyboard a
1315920	1319960	Spider on your keyboard. I've never heard of that one before
1321160	1326600	Well, it's do any of y'all have any money on you right now. I got three dollars
1329880	1335100	How about we wage your three dollars apiece on what on ourselves being the same
1335160	1342100	Well, I if I think it might be all three of us or I don't care if it's me or you or Clark or all of
1342100	1346020	Us but it is me. So sure. I'll bet my three dollars
1349700	1356740	About it Clark, it's just three dollars. Just a friendly little wager. I mean, I don't want to bet against saving the world
1356740	1362520	Is that the bet we're making that now now the bet is that you'll save the world, but it's three dollars
1362520	1363820	It's just you know
1363820	1367860	It's not gonna feel too bad when you both, you know have given me six dollars
1367860	1369860	That'll
1369900	1375620	Be nine dollars. Yeah, I mean sure. Yeah, sure. Oh, I guess I'll bet on it
1375620	1378180	Hey, I'll race you do to the end of the tunnel. Yeah, I think I see
1378180	1383420	I don't know what time of day it is, but I think I see the light up there if it is daytime
1383580	1388400	Bet you can't beat me. I've start sprinting. I don't think Clark is gonna race
1389660	1391260	John races
1391260	1393900	All right, roll athletics the two of you
1394500	1401180	John Lee petty more the third than Keith Vigna are racing down this very narrow pathway. Yeah, which is a
1405300	1410020	25 as you guys are racing John Lee petty more you are
1410380	1417460	a little bit behind because as you're saying like let's race keeping it just like took off and started sprinting and you chase after him
1417460	1419980	And right when you're about to take the lead from him
1420140	1424500	He trips over his own feet and lands face-first
1424860	1428420	In the sewage just off to the left of the right side of this path
1428820	1433460	That was confusing and lands face-first in the sewage in this little
1434180	1437340	Small pathway that goes down the middle of this tunnel that you're in
1437740	1441140	John just breezes past and raises both his arms in the air
1442580	1449140	He just won the fucking Boston Marathon and both of your hands are now lit by sunlight
1449140	1454980	That is coming in from a drain a storm drain. You're the it now and
1458420	1464420	As I as I casually walk up to the point that Keith fell in I tried and offer a hand to help him out of
1464420	1470900	There I stand up just the entire front side of me is covered and just thick
1471860	1473660	green and brown
1473660	1475260	Goo and
1475260	1482460	I open my eyes and like you can just see my eyes are the only thing that aren't just covered in that color and
1484540	1486540	Clark
1489660	1491660	What do I do
1495620	1497620	Grab Clark's hand
1498420	1506340	And it kind of squids I try to like walk out of the middle and yeah, it's just like squeezing out of my shoes and
1508980	1515820	Turn around and see this and I have to like suppress a strong Samaritan urge to mercy kill them both
1517940	1520620	Let's go ahead and get some Constitution rolls for
1521780	1523780	for how vile this is
1524340	1531300	Keith you're at a negative 40 on this roll for being the one who fell in I have a plus 10 for my robot abilities
1531740	1535920	At a negative 40, I would have 30 and I just rolled at 31
1537500	1543580	Brings me up to 70, but I rolled a 75. Oof. What'd you give me negative 20 for having it all over your hand?
1543580	1546460	I pass a 72 on a 95
1546460	1549740	All right, 80 Clark is the only one who is not just like fully
1550340	1557340	Wretching right now and the other two of you you're gonna take a negative 20 on all rolls until you can
1557660	1561340	Figure out a way to alleviate this situation. So your abs are just like
1562140	1564740	overkill working themselves because of how
1568820	1573100	I like get near the storm drain. I take my shirt off and I try to use the
1574020	1580860	Backside of it that's not like covered in stuff and try to like wipe my arms off a little bit and wipe my face
1580860	1583980	and then I walk up to Keith's clean back and
1588280	1594140	Yeah, so now I'm I'm shirtless my face has less goo my arms have less goo
1594460	1601720	My hair's like matted on my face because of that and then I've got my big shorts on and you have John's vomit all over
1603220	1607060	and I as I take a couple more steps, I realize that my
1607760	1612880	Shoes are just soaked. So I go ahead and take my shoes and socks off to all right going barefoot
1613020	1617660	That may be an issue if you need to step on stuff on spikes
1620340	1622340	Role-playing baby
1624620	1626620	Didn't suspect my knife floor
1629200	1631360	You wanted to have a race did you
1633340	1635340	I'm gonna go pee. Okay
1638780	1642860	The fucking echo and your cavernous living room it that's perfect
1653060	1657060	Keith vigna as you look up out of this storm drain
1657100	1661320	You see the neighborhood that surrounds beans pond
1661580	1668540	You can't quite see into the pond where the water is from this angle, but you know exactly where you are guys
1668540	1674340	I think we're we're near Maggie's do you see smoldering remains of a house? I
1675980	1677980	Can only smell one thing
1680260	1683740	Guys take a look. I think we're here and then I pull my phone out and
1684380	1688220	Type in something into my phone minimally toxic, okay
1698780	1703700	Yeah, you probably probably don't want to use that phone again to get around some Clorox whaps though
1704300	1712200	Yeah, I'll wash off in the pond when you say that you'll wash off in the pond you immediately remember your conversation with Claire
1712200	1717980	Blankenship. Oh, yeah, there ain't no water in the pond. Do you guys want to crawl out first?
1718600	1720600	So you don't have to you know, crawl through
1721200	1727040	All this Clark happily takes him up on that. Yeah, we'll go and we'll go and order of soil
1727040	1732720	I guess least the most I need everyone to roll to take out their headphones
1736360	1738360	Power huh
1739360	1740880	Yeah
1740880	1747360	Fail 96. Wait, what is it's a negative what for my rules? You're a negative 20. I
1748640	1750640	pass an 18
1750960	1756840	60 fail 87 on a 30. Okay Thomas and Luke take off your headphones
1756840	1758840	Oh
1766840	1769880	Clark as you crawl out when you stand
1770600	1776960	you can see that beans pond has been completely emptied of its contents and
1777520	1782340	There's just this muddy basin there in the middle of this little like
1782980	1787900	Neighborhood where these streets kind of cross and in the middle of this pond
1788380	1794940	right next to a mostly buried metal door in the ground you see a
1795540	1800380	Tank of fish to the brim just teeming and inside
1800820	1805740	there is a gaunt little boy and he is
1806620	1809780	Drowning and he is desperately trying to stay afloat
1809780	1816060	But there's so many fish in this tank that they seem to be keeping him down how far away from all this
1816060	1816500	Are we?
1816500	1822260	okay, so literally you're on one side of the street when you when you get up and the pond is on the other side of
1822260	1824260	the street across from you and
1824260	1829220	Then the pond starts what like 10 yards past the other side of the street
1829220	1832500	And so the middle of the pond is probably 15 yards past that
1832540	1837980	So the middle where this is happening is about 25 yards away, okay, so yeah beans pond is not very big
1837980	1843580	It's just like a no like a little little water hole, you know here and there it kind of mushrooms
1843580	1848540	It's bigger at the top than it is at the bottom. Okay, and you can take your headphones off
1848740	1850740	Cool
1858060	1865740	Thomas as John Lee Pettymore climbs up out of this you see that across the street from where you are is beans pond and
1866220	1871420	In the very middle of beans pond, which is now a muddy basin
1872060	1874260	sans water sans fish
1874940	1878060	Just mud and in the very center
1878220	1883340	there is a mostly buried metal door in the ground and
1884000	1888220	Standing there right next to it is Pastor Adam Kane
1889180	1896700	Wearing an old motorcycle helmet that seems to have some weird tubes and you can kind of see that the red light is
1896900	1900780	Lit on it John draws his gun and tells him to take the helmet off
1904260	1906260	Oh
1909340	1913220	Luke yes, as you crawl out you're just scraping this
1913700	1919620	Disgusting refuse on to the side of the concrete as you drag your way out and it's kind of like building up
1919620	1922060	you know as you pull yourself out and
1922860	1929540	When you kind of stand up you see that across the street is beans pond, but there's no water
1929540	1931500	There's no fish just as you expected
1931540	1935380	But what you didn't really expect is to see you know in the very middle
1935620	1939860	there's a mostly buried metal door in the ground and
1940580	1944620	Sitting right next to it is an old motorcycle helmet
1945460	1950220	With strange tubes and the light on it is green
1950220	1952220	Oh
1960580	1967580	And as soon as you're all standing up there John Lee Pettymore the third pulls his gun and hollers take off the helmet
1968020	1971140	Take it off now. What would help would help with John?
1972060	1978760	Who's wearing a helmet Adam Pastor Kane? What he's standing on the door? I don't there's no there's nobody there John
1978760	1982680	There's like there's a kid who's floundering over there in that tank of fish right there. What do you talk?
1982680	1987520	Well, no fish. There's just the helmets near the door on Adam Kane
1987600	1992160	What clearly you two are not savior material and I pulled the trigger
1993440	1996800	roll firearms three you fire and
1998000	2000000	Joe Luke take your headphones off
2009040	2014880	Thomas when John Lee Pettymore fires aims true world damage rolled e10 eight
2015640	2017640	immediately let me roll Constitution
2018420	2025520	Pastor Adam Kane falls backwards and the helmet flies off of his head into the mud behind him and he lays
2025800	2031360	Motionless on the ground right next to the metal door that is mostly buried in the ground
2031360	2035680	I run up to administer first aid. Okay, John begins running into
2036560	2038280	beans pond
2038280	2040280	Rolled dexterity for me
2040760	2043220	43 on a 45. Oh, yeah
2043220	2049200	so as you kind of like get up to the edge you see it's just mud slide kind of down and
2049520	2053160	You can put your feet wide enough apart to kind of
2053760	2059800	balance as you kind of slide down into where the bottom of the pond was and
2060440	2063880	You run up to administer first aid
2068280	2070280	Oh
2072480	2078200	Clark Bishop you see John Lee Pettymore fire his weapon into this tank and
2079080	2081240	You see a lot less
2082040	2088840	Movement from inside only the fish are going crazy and you see the water begins turning red
2090240	2096920	Okay, Clark. What do you do? I'm running up to get a better look at what's what's
2097520	2102520	Following John I'm following John I think right and he run in in the same direction that I would want to be running
2102880	2110280	Absolutely, go ahead and roll a dexterity to try to like get into the bottom of the pond without slipping and falling. I
2110840	2113980	Pass a 25 on a 60. All righty
2113980	2115980	I
2122940	2128340	John Lee Pettymore fires his weapon hits one of the tubes on this old motorcycle helmet the tube
2128660	2130660	explodes just this and
2130900	2138140	Then he runs into the base and slides down the side and then Clark Bishop follows right behind him. I run after
2138700	2139860	them
2139860	2140900	To
2140900	2146100	Amazing go ahead and roll dexterity as well at a negative 20 as you're sliding down
2146100	2152340	You can see this mud. It just kind of looks like the refuse that is all over you
2152340	2155660	I gotta check my decks minus 20 to see if I pass
2156500	2163580	Shirtless you have these giant. Oh nice. Okay, so I have 50 decks minus 20 is 30 and I rolled
2165140	2167140	79
2169860	2171700	I
2171700	2173300	Had to do some math in my head
2173300	2179900	But I fail Keith vignette eat shit as he's trying to get into this pond
2180340	2187140	slips falls face forward into the mud and begins slowly sliding down the
2187620	2189620	pond wall as
2189900	2193780	the other two make their way into the very center and
2194380	2198860	Immediately shots begin firing from either side of you
2202180	2204180	Keith vignette
2204420	2206140	You're face down in this mud
2206140	2210740	You can feel yourself kind of sliding forward and then all of a sudden you feel a bullet
2210820	2218140	Pierce into your ribs on your left side and you don't know whether it went all the way through but breathing becomes
2218580	2221340	Extremely difficult as you take seven damage
2222140	2224140	Shit
2224860	2230460	Except you can't really breathe in too much because it's just mud all up in your face spot and shit
2233580	2235580	Clark Bishop, it's your turn. What do you do?
2235900	2238060	Clark wants to run up to
2238460	2244340	The tank that I see and try and put myself between it and one of the you said it was coming from both sides
2244340	2250900	Right the shooters. Yep, put the tank between one and another shooter and try to return fire from where I think it's coming from
2250900	2252460	Okay roll
2252460	2254460	search
2255060	2259620	To see if you can figure out where these shots are coming from not alert news
2260540	2267620	49 on us 20 for search. What's your alertness 70? Oh, man, your alertness is so much better than your search
2269020	2274660	No, that'll play that'll play alertness would come in here because you're focused on doing something else and the shots are ringing out
2274660	2276180	so you can kind of
2276180	2279900	immediately see that there is a privacy fence and
2280500	2287060	You see that there's a gun being held just like over the fence. That's just like firing. What do you do?
2287060	2290460	I would like to try and fire at where I see the hand coming from
2290460	2296220	I would be aiming for center mass if I could picture a person standing behind it through the fence. Okay, roll firearms. I
2298100	2305740	Pass 47 on an 80. Okay, then roll a detentive damage. We'll subtract two for fence cover. We'll subtract one
2305740	2307540	It's just a wooden fence
2307540	2315340	Three okay minus one is two and you hear a yelp come out from that side a female voice screams out in pain
2315340	2321460	John Lee Pettymore the third. What are you doing slowly realizing that if Adam Kane was wearing the helmet and
2322180	2326380	Had already swapped that I might have just shot someone dear to me
2326420	2333040	What if even he swapped drew out of Carrie Paige's body into his body and he's in Carrie Paige's bodies
2333240	2338120	Anyway, I'm running up to I'm running up to the person I just shot and you you made it their last round
2338120	2342180	So what are you doing you your goal was to get first aid on to this person?
2342180	2347480	But shots began ringing out you can change what you were doing if you want or you can continue trying to do first aid
2347480	2351120	I don't have a great first aid. Can I try to persuade them to first aid their selves?
2353240	2360420	Yeah, he is still conscious oh no, he is unconscious he failed his constitution check I'd like to persuade him to become conscious
2360420	2362420	When
2363100	2365320	When I see Clark
2365900	2369700	Shoot the person behind the fence or return fire in that direction
2369700	2375660	I spin around the other direction and try to see where the other fire is coming from and I've got I've got both John's gun
2379580	2381580	Man what a episode
2381580	2383580	Title
2384220	2385860	90 on a 60
2385860	2392140	It's not the kind of episode title you typically want but a 90 on a 60 is an equivalent of what you tried to say
2392140	2396220	With your words and so it's your firing with both John's gun
2397060	2403420	Neither one hits as your oh as you're trying to figure out where it came from where you fuck. Sorry
2403420	2410500	You know, I just looking without you're just looking you cannot figure out where this these shots are coming from from the other side
2410500	2414440	I fire a couple impotent shots into the air just to try to intimidate them
2414440	2418980	That is the John Lee petty more way Keith Vigna. What are you doing? I want to ask you a question real quick
2418980	2420900	I'm Zach. You can ask me a question at any time
2420900	2424980	I guess they already know about that. I'm like part robot or whatever, but
2425500	2429900	Would that have had any effect on when I got shot or was that I don't remember
2430620	2432620	well mechanically
2433020	2438100	Unfortunately, we didn't make that a thing which seems like it should have been it's probably doesn't matter
2438100	2440440	I could have done better. But here we are. Okay
2441420	2445700	Okay, so I was shot in the left side, right? Yeah, correct
2445700	2452640	I like sit up or like sit on my butt. I wipe all the mud off my face and I blow
2453500	2459340	the mud out of both my nostrils and then I shove my finger up my nose and
2460700	2464700	get a little bump do you have on your character sheet what the
2465580	2471780	Improvement is for doing that it has varied. Yeah, it was willpower based, but we weren't we're not really
2472300	2478740	If you lose 10 luck, then I'll let you go ahead and make an action this turn. How about that? Okay, I'll
2479300	2482460	Lose my 10 luck that I made the other day
2483180	2489020	And I just want to sprint back up the wall of the not pool
2489540	2490540	Absolutely
2490540	2494180	Since I got shot in the left side. I want to like look over to that direction
2494260	2496860	Is that where Clark is shooting at?
2496860	2502460	I was picturing in my head that I was shooting to the right because that was where the tank kind of was
2502740	2507020	Like I would put myself shooting over it to the right. Yeah, he was shooting the right
2507020	2512140	So John was shooting up in the air, but he was looking left. I'm gonna draw a quick map real quick
2512780	2517000	Keith you got hit from the left side, which is the side that
2518000	2523000	John is kind of looking for someone on that side. So I want to turn around run up the
2523600	2525600	wall of the pond and
2525940	2531520	So that at that point I'll be on my right look over to the right and do I see any anybody or any?
2532080	2534360	first off go ahead and roll a
2535160	2540040	Dexterity or athletics to get back up without slipping at a negative 20 still fail
2540040	2543800	So as you're trying to slide back up, you're kind of looking off to the right
2543800	2550360	But you can't get your grip on this mud for long enough to be able to keep your head straight
2551080	2557840	especially with this deep pain coming in your side and shots begin firing off once more as
2558760	2562020	The shots fire off. None of you get hit Clark
2562480	2569480	One of the bullets flies right by your ear and the other ones are all hitting the mud right next to Keith Vigna
2569900	2573460	Clark Bishop, it's your turn is the person behind the fence still shooting
2573800	2576880	Yes, I'm gonna shoot again. I want them to stop shooting
2577760	2579760	Roll it up, baby
2580720	2584400	Pass 23 on an 80 roll a d10 a
2586280	2591640	Two okay fence is still in the way so you kind of aim low and you
2593720	2600920	There that was a weird noise it wasn't the correct noise, sorry, okay, that was an alarming noise. Yeah
2604640	2606920	Specifically wasn't Drew's voice, please. No
2608560	2612400	Okay, John Lee Pettymore, what are you doing since they kept firing on us?
2612400	2618760	have I now identified where the fire on the left is coming from if you roll a search or an alertness with a
2619080	2622560	Plus 20 since they've done been firing she haven't teen
2622660	2629260	Yeah, you actually see that there is someone hiding behind a grill in someone's backyard
2629420	2632900	There's no privacy fence on this backyard and on their deck
2633220	2640260	There's a little propane grill and there's someone hiding right behind it and they keep poking up and firing
2640260	2645460	I'd like to fire back anything cool. This is the end of your stakeout, buddy
2648140	2655380	Plus 20 on the firearms check 29 roll a d10 for damage 3 I rolled the tens one
2655380	2657380	Will you give me the 30?
2659740	2664340	You fire and you hear a man's voice cry out and he's like
2665740	2669180	Keith Vigna, what are you doing stuff? I'm gonna try to get out of the
2669820	2672860	Pond again, and yeah, you'll be able to make it out on this turn
2672860	2676140	Okay, I do that and then when I hear John yell
2676140	2680780	I want to look over and can I see the guy too or do I need to roll a check?
2681180	2681700	No
2681700	2688140	Now the John has shot him and he's kind of shown himself both people have been shot and you guys kind of know where they
2688140	2690780	At least were last round at the beginning
2690780	2697820	I'm going to pull my gun out and run towards the grill and I'm gonna fire as I'm running
2697980	2700960	Go ahead and roll a negative 20 a 9
2701780	2703780	So yeah, I'd be 10 for damage
2704340	2706340	6 yeah, I'll do
2707580	2713940	Cool as you're running you're kind of like slipping on the mud a little bit and you're smelling all of this shit and mud
2713940	2714500	that's just
2714500	2719780	Covering you at this point and you fire and you hit this dude as he's like laying on the ground
2720060	2720900	John hit him
2720900	2727260	He kind of fell over and you fire you hit him right in the torso and he kind of rolls over and he's facing
2727260	2733220	you and you see at this point Asher little who is one of the parents of
2733940	2739880	Aiden and Alice little who went missing a couple days ago and you see that he has
2740040	2746920	Laser faded jeans that are bedazzled and he's wearing a long-sleeve shirt that is skin tight to his
2747160	2750980	Crossfit body and the front of the shirt has a picture of his children
2751560	2759000	Aiden and Alice who are twin nine-year-olds and he is wearing a fair amount of makeup and he is rocking some Yeezys and
2759160	2762000	he is crying out in pain and
2762600	2765820	You don't know if he's gonna be able to get back up, but he is not
2766540	2771840	Unconscious yet. Was he one of the guys in one of the cars or trucks?
2771840	2776160	That was the Impala that was coming after you guys that had a refrigerator
2776260	2782880	Yeah, he was driving that longs to the littles and you recognize the two of them from driving it and they are
2783500	2788100	members of the first Church of contention and now the first
2789060	2795100	Creek family of contention from behind the fence the gun raises again just fires
2795820	2798960	Aimlessly hitting the mud around you
2799700	2801700	but asher little
2801900	2807780	Mustering all this strength like like the end of that Keanu Reeves Patrick Shweezy movie
2807780	2814260	But instead of moving to fire up into the air. He just fires directly at Keith Vigna and he hits him
2815140	2817140	There's seven more damage. Oh
2817620	2819620	Fuck
2820140	2827180	Yeah, you're just out in the open yeah, I'm at 10 health at this point you're 24 total
2827180	2831700	Yep, holy shit when you went from 17 down to 10
2832220	2837420	he hits you in the hip and you feel it hit the bone and
2838100	2842900	You think it might have cracked as you begin like limping?
2843340	2847820	Toward him in that direction and you you're just oh my you
2848500	2852620	Real crunch, you know, you you don't feel good. It's pain
2853220	2858980	I've never been shot by a gun, but my drugs helped me any with that pain. No, okay
2858980	2863820	Okay, and an adrenaline doesn't help them with the pain. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah sure. Yeah
2863820	2868900	You've been shot twice once in the ribs once in the hip and you're still standing. So yeah fucking helps
2869220	2871140	There we go, okay
2871140	2878800	Again, I'm just gonna continue limping as fast as I can at him Clark Bishop. You're up and as this round begins
2879660	2883420	Clark Bishop, there is no tank here
2884220	2891100	There are no fish here and John Lee Pettymore the body that is right next to you not there
2891500	2894140	the only thing the two of you see on the ground is
2895140	2898620	Is this metal door that is mostly buried
2899140	2903660	Looks completely sealed and it says here lies the beans
2904780	2906780	scientists beyond measure
2907100	2912380	Saviors of the world god damn it if he's the fucking Savior
2914840	2921320	Clark Bishop, what do you do seeing the fish tank disappear kind of throws me, but I'm yelling back at Keith Keith
2921360	2926000	They're shooting at you get down and I would like to try and see if I could pry that door open
2926120	2929200	Like that's the only thing I could find cover if I could get that door open
2929640	2936760	I'm trying to write open as you try to find any sort of crease or anything. There's nothing
2936760	2940340	There's no handle on this door. There's no hinges on this door
2940720	2945880	It almost doesn't even look like a door other than the fact that that's how I've described it so far
2946200	2948200	Like
2949000	2951000	An impassable metal plate
2951560	2953560	yeah, almost like
2954160	2960160	Yeah, an impassable metal plate. I couldn't have said it better myself. I'll just edit out you saying it and then I'll say it
2960840	2962840	perfect
2962880	2967360	Listeners may not know but I've come up with the entire story and plot of
2968680	2972960	Podcast as we go and I just generously let Zach edit that out. I
2973960	2976820	Hope he doesn't accidentally leave this one in this time
2978280	2983720	He's a promise and he would definitely knows exactly what's going on at all times
2984600	2990640	100% command of the story the characters the events as they have transpired thus far
2991720	2993720	I'm all over it, baby
2996480	3001700	Clark as you're trying to figure out how to open this door you look up and you see that there is no fish tank
3001820	3003820	Whatsoever in front of you roll sanity
3008180	3012060	Yeah, baby, it's a 70 that's a fail over my power
3012060	3016260	Oh my god, Zach on the fucking webcam just started like
3016980	3022060	Curling his fingers like a super when he heard that Joe had rolled over his power
3024500	3028820	What do I lose you just lose one sanity, but you also lose your shit
3028940	3031900	So Clark was going to hit the deck since he doesn't have any cover
3031900	3037860	But now he's gonna stand up like nothing could hurt him and charge the person behind the fence
3038240	3040700	Shooting the whole way as he runs so we'll go
3041580	3049980	negative 20 for blinding anger on the firearms check as you make your way up out of the muddy basin that you have found yourself in a
3050740	3054100	bowl of slop I pass a
3054580	3057700	52 on a 60 nice roll a d10
3058820	3066180	6 you fire in and you actually have knocked away enough of this fence at this point that
3066180	3072940	You see a woman who is wearing a skin tight t-shirt that has two children's faces
3073340	3080180	On it and you recognize these two children as Aiden and Alice little gonna sexualize a grieving mother. I
3081060	3083060	wasn't going to
3084060	3089380	What just happened skin tight t-shirt, oh, that's all that it takes for you
3094500	3098520	They do CrossFit man, I don't know what to tell you I am aroused and offended
3101260	3103260	Typical
3105620	3112220	And you hit what is very likely in your mind Avery little and she falls backward and
3112700	3116740	You just hear this moaning. How about that? Do you like that Thomas?
3117380	3120180	From behind the fence that's been blown away
3127620	3133780	John Lee Pettymore, it's your turn rule the body that was once there is no longer. I need you to roll sanity
3133780	3137800	He's gonna freak out but that's also a huge relief to him 13 pass
3138040	3144920	Okay, you don't need to freak out and you don't need to lose in the sanity you are extremely relieved that you didn't shoot
3144920	3148320	What might have been a person is Asher still firing?
3148520	3153640	Yeah, and he's a he's actually he's firing at Keith vignette and he's falling
3153640	3156880	I fire at Asher go ahead and roll that firearms check
3157360	3159680	16 well d10 for damage
3160560	3162560	to mmm
3163560	3164680	As
3164680	3170160	You fire it's not enough to take him down as blood splatters on the concrete behind him of this
3170360	3176320	This little back deck that he's on but his eyes are wide open and his aim is still
3176720	3181720	Directed at Keith vigna who is slowly trudging toward him and Keith vigna
3181720	3185080	It is your turn and it is likely an important one
3185640	3189520	Can I just say something guys say something that you're allowed to it's a podcast
3189520	3192680	There's only four of us you got no, you know when Joe and I
3194200	3200000	Farcically disappeared these children, you know a very a very light-hearted
3201640	3203640	Goofy
3204480	3211160	Almost whimsical. Yeah cartoonish disappearance Mary Poppins esque. I thought that'd be the last we heard of it. I didn't realize
3212440	3214440	There would be these kind of consequences
3215280	3217560	angry citizenry angry parents
3219600	3223900	Didn't really think anybody would miss the kids while this shit was going down, but I yeah
3223900	3226940	I just want to say admire here
3236920	3240240	Just kidding, I'll probably amp it up Keith vigna. What are you doing?
3240800	3246360	The pain is starting to get to me. So I am gonna like get down on my knees and
3246960	3248960	Like
3254480	3261260	Get down on my knees and aim at Asher and fire Adam shirtless he's covered in all sorts of
3276360	3278360	Hey
3280520	3285120	Luke yeah, what are you doing, man? I just tell you I'm on oh shit. I
3287080	3289080	Shot him
3289080	3291080	Tell you to roll firearms
3291520	3293520	69
3293840	3298580	Don't don't touch him. Don't move your hands. Don't move your hands. Don't move your hands put the other one up in the air
3298800	3300960	Are you gonna run in there and check? Yes, I am

3311280	3319920	Don't need to I did it don't have to lie to us. He's not in the room. Holy fucking shit. It's a goddamn 69
3322920	3328520	I was about to actually scream, but then I remember my girlfriend went to bed and was like, please don't scream
3331800	3333800	But it was a 69, honey
3335680	3337680	She can't argue with that, right
3339160	3341160	She gets it what are we talking about?
3341400	3346680	Just how I told my girlfriend I wouldn't scream during this session and I really wanted to win the girl
3347560	3349560	Would you confirm that?
3350520	3353800	Taylor's asleep. So I thought you're talking about me running through the house
3357360	3360500	Saying I could be like, well, it's not as bad as what's act
3361960	3366480	Exactly. Can you imagine being married to that monster? Okay, so
3369920	3374760	Keith do you want to shoot this dude dead? Do you want to keep him alive or do you want to hit the propane tank?
3376200	3380600	Okay. Yeah, I want to kill him. I want to hit him actually fuck it. I want to hit the propane tank
3381920	3384020	These both have consequences. I'm sure
3385400	3388300	Yeah, we stopped whose house is this stop getting shot
3388300	3395180	It's season two you guys are just playing citizens in contention and then all of a sudden
3399660	3402300	Okay, so I dropped down on my knees and
3403100	3406160	I like have Asher in my sights
3406680	3413100	But I just noticed the propane tank that's right next to him under the grill. I aim a little bit left
3413820	3421460	Fire a couple rounds the propane tank explodes and I say soy beans puto
3423740	3426300	That's actually dope that means I am beans bitch
3431100	3435220	It's also a cross-lingual soybeans, but
3437460	3442060	Okay, that was incredible take ten look back
3443220	3445220	sweet, thanks
3445860	3449420	Did you actually roll for any of that that was the 69 that was my 69
3450540	3452540	That's why he's allowed to do whatever he wants
3455140	3457140	After it explodes I
3457180	3463180	Look down into the pond and want to start heading towards those guys. Okay. Yeah for sure
3463180	3467340	I just assumed that the fiery explosion killed him it did
3468260	3471380	Tight, I knew that already though. I didn't even have to see it
3472340	3475420	So Keith you don't even look behind you as this
3476140	3478140	grill explodes
3478180	3485740	throwing the body of Asher little through the backsliding glass door of this home as it
3485740	3487740	glass shatters and
3488380	3493140	Your eyes are set at the bottom of the pond
3493620	3497580	but above that Clark Bishop is walking up the other side and
3497780	3503660	Makes his way to the fence and as you're trying to look through where you've been shooting through the fence and these holes that you've
3503660	3504660	made
3504660	3509620	The person you've been aiming at seems to have crawled out of view. What do you do?
3509620	3515380	Have I got my eyes out? Am I still under that over the power role? Have you got?
3516380	3519180	Yaws out Thomas you into it
3519820	3521300	No
3521300	3525480	Don't like any of you needlessly sexualized sexualized in this
3525480	3532520	And yes, you are you are done Clark with your yeah. Yes. I kind of want to just yell
3533160	3538160	Stop stop shooting. I'll stop shooting. Stop shooting and I'll stop shooting. Do I get any you just hear?
3538680	3541720	Prayer. Yes. Thank you Jesus. Oh god. Yes
3541720	3549600	no, and there's times like these where retribution is the only necessary thing in the eyes of those who are light in the Lord and
3549880	3550840	To
3550840	3553040	pervade the evil of this world
3553040	3558400	We must desecrate the bodies of those who are succumbing to the pleasures of this earth
3558480	3563400	Can I strafe left and right around that hole to try and get an angle that I can see?
3563440	3569720	Yeah, as you strafe through the hole and see her she is on the ground directly aimed up at you
3569720	3573640	She'd readied in action with a successful firearms check and she fires
3574320	3577240	Directly through the hole at you and rolled a nine
3577240	3579240	For
3579640	3581640	Damage
3582040	3585720	For damage, yeah, what were you Alan hit point? I'm at 20
3586360	3591040	Okay, so you go down to a well, I'm sorry. I'm at 26. I was full goodness gracious
3591040	3595380	So you go down to 15 quick math. That's uh, you do that's 11
3596720	3599880	yeah, I would be not that you go down to 17 and
3601240	3604680	That's slow math. Well quick math isn't necessarily good
3607400	3609400	First math
3610400	3612960	First math Beth math. Oh, that's
3614960	3616960	First math best math
3617480	3619400	hard to say
3619400	3621400	first math best math
3621560	3628200	All right, so we've got a new math best math. Yeah, say it faster though first math best math
3629400	3631400	first math best math
3631640	3635120	Well, I shouldn't be in radio Clark you got hit
3637600	3639600	We've it's a wall for the radio
3639800	3647000	so Clark gets hit directly in the shoulder and you just feel the blow back through and
3647600	3655560	It's your turn. I want to shoot her a return fire. I want to return fire. She just shot me. I wanna shoot her
3656800	3658520	roll firearms
3658520	3663520	I pass a 36 on an 8k roll damage
3663880	3668760	Fuck a three. Yeah, that'll extinguish her life. So
3669640	3676820	As you put out this fire of a human being John John Lee Pettymore comes up behind and surveys the scene and says
3677680	3680040	Ashers to ashers dust to dust
3682520	3686480	And Avery's to Avery's I think mine was better
3688200	3690840	Kind of why I think I'm the savior I'm running over to him
3691360	3695800	And I'm like guys did you hear what I said, did you hear what I said when I shot it I
3696960	3703920	Got him. Yeah, you were said you were talking about soybeans. Yeah, it's Spanish. Did you hear my thing about Asher's to Asher's?
3703920	3706520	Yeah, that was really good, too. Thanks
3708480	3712200	So did you did you destroy the helmet Oh
3712880	3716040	When you shot it Clark is looking puzzled at you
3716600	3719000	But I never I'm there was never a helmet guys
3720000	3726800	Right down there and I point when you look down you see no helmet and I need you to roll a sanity. Oh good
3728160	3730680	72 so over my power and
3732560	3737640	Fail and how many and how many do I lose just one? Okay, I hit my breaking point
3746040	3748040	I
3748880	3753880	Look go ahead and roll a D 100 and for each time you roll it out of three times
3753880	3761240	I will tell you what your option of a mania will be from the table 10 from Call of Cthulhu 7th edition called
3761320	3764680	Sample mania is okay. First roll is a 14
3765500	3768000	14 is going to be a rhythm a
3768240	3772440	Rith arith mania obsessive preoccupation with numbers
3772440	3780000	Okay, second one's 29 29 is going to be color o mania obsession with a specific color and
3780640	3787400	57 and 57 is icon o mania obsession with icons or portraits. I'll go with that one
3787400	3792400	Yeah, do you still have that picture? I do indeed. Yep, that'll that'll help. Okay, cool
3792400	3794400	So
3801480	3807240	As Keith Vigna looks at the helmet and Clark Bishop's like there's never a helmet there did
3808040	3812000	One of you took when he took the helmet when he took the helmet who took Keith
3812000	3815520	There was never a helmet there wouldn't help. I saw I saw John shoot the helmet
3815640	3821960	Did did you guys take my picture too? Did you did you take that photo and I have to start searching my pockets?
3822520	3825480	it's in my back pocket and I look at it and I like
3826040	3831440	Hide it from him Keith. This is mine. This is mine Keith. Who's who's in the picture right now?
3831440	3836200	It's still me still me milder grave gave us that picture. We couldn't have taken it. No, no
3836200	3841440	I'm it like took it from me. Oh, I've still got it. What what's what's the door?
3841440	3848280	Say fucking he's gonna find out just fucking show it says the beans thing. All right, it says the beans thing
3848520	3854960	Here here lies the beans it's safe saviors plural of the world. I want to run down and read it for myself
3855440	3857440	everybody roll power
3857840	3859840	power
3860880	3866720	Pass 31 on the city. I got another nine. I pass a 45 on a 60
3867640	3869640	the door failed
3871780	3877860	Clark Bishop Keith Vigna and John Lee Pettymore you all won the power contest this time
3877980	3884020	And you each feel a loosening of some external forces grip on your perception
3884020	3888580	And the scene, you know and a single blink has changed completely
3889660	3893160	beans pond is encircled entirely by the
3893460	3898660	Six-story tall wall of water and the three of you on the inside of the foul-smelling
3899660	3900900	floating moat
3900900	3906900	Clark and John this unnatural feat of nonsense is right behind you and you can see ice
3907220	3908700	forming on the water
3908700	3916020	always broken immediately by one of the many fish hopping out sideways and plopping back in with the force of this
3916460	3923000	horizontal gravity Keith begins running down into the muddy basin to see the engraving on this
3923520	3929060	impassable metal plate careful not to slip and fall face first in the mud again
3929460	3933860	But across the pond on the other bank is a whole situation
3934740	3939460	Casey Kristoff the mullet rocking janitor of the first Church of contention
3940340	3945080	holds a pistol to the back of Carrie Paige's head who is
3945580	3951380	Blindfolded and on her knees and right next to them is Pastor Adam Cain
3951860	3958140	Wearing the strange-looking motorcycle helmet red light lit and he is driving the four-wheeler
3958740	3964540	About to drop into this former pond and he's aiming straight for Keith
3965220	3971800	Strapped to the back of the four-wheeler you found an a-plus storage crashed in the woods and had drew fix up all nice
3972020	3980060	Strapped in behind Big Daddy Cain is the radio with the odd glass tubes and its green light is lit
3980060	3987500	And sitting atop this unnatural radio claws holding on for dear life is an extremely
3988140	3990220	determined black cat
4012740	4014740	Try
4017500	4019500	Yeah
