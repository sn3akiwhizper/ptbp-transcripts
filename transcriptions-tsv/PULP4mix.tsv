0	2320	Hello, my friends.
2320	8080	It's once again your fabulously ferocious furry friend, Wolf the Dog.
8080	11040	And I am your host with the most,
11040	13600	your hoist with the moist,
13600	15440	your greasy baby,
15440	18400	your large friend with the good hair.
18400	26080	And I'm talking at y'all live from sometime here at 694.2 PTBP,
26080	29680	wherever I am's best whatever this is.
29680	34480	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Alchemy Yeti with Two T's,
34480	38080	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod.
38080	41680	Have you considered doing something similar, listener?
41680	45680	I liked it when Alchemy Yeti with Two T's did it.
45680	48560	Alchemy Yeti with Two T's writes,
48560	51360	Well, hello there, my dearest Wolf.
51360	53760	You can call me Alchemy Yeti.
53760	55600	Appreciate the howl.
55600	58720	How's the gourbage been treatin' ya?
58720	62800	Hopefully extra slimy for your eclectic tastes.
62800	68720	PTBP has been a favorite of ours ever since the trailer you fine boys put out.
68720	75200	We run various TTRPGs on my Twitch and YouTube with the wife,
75200	81520	and you've all been a wonderful inspiration to start up another mystery horror series.
81520	85200	Can't wait to ingest your future projects.
85200	90800	Wishin' you the spiciest and most fetid under grime, Yeti.
91520	94720	Well damn, thanks Yeti with the Two T's.
94720	96080	But uh, Twitch?
96720	98000	YouTube?
98000	100560	What about MeTube?
100560	102160	TTRPG?
102880	106000	Trash today's really pissin' good?
106000	108080	What else could that even mean?
108080	112000	You may speak in words that only bring confusion to me,
112000	117200	but I appreciate the kind words you said at me through the World Wide Web.
117200	124480	You truly seem to be a gourmand like myself, with only the finest tastes in trash.
124480	129760	If you wanna be like Yeti with the Two T's and write up somethin' for your wolf to howl,
129760	132320	tag at PretendingPod on the internet,
132320	137280	or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts and holler at us about it.
137280	143840	If you wanna hear 30 bonus episodes, that's the $5 tier on Patreon.
143840	147440	And if you wanna submit a name and description
147440	154720	for a potential NPC and location to be used in the show, that's the damn $10 tier.

159840	163520	get your mitts on some shirts that kicketh ass,
163520	168560	or even play a gaming session homebrewed and GM'd by Zach,
168560	173360	alongside Joe, Luke, and Thomas, as your fellow players.
173360	180000	Now that's all also available over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.
180000	181280	You know what they say.
181920	183520	The links are in the show notes.
184080	189680	Thanks to everyone who reached out with appreciation for last week's puns.
189680	193280	I hope you can also enjoy creative segues.
195440	197120	It's time for the news.
197520	204080	Last time, our intrepid hero smashed part of Cicero Mordaunt's new invention
204080	210000	in rages that ranged from dutiful to envious to cocaine fuel,
210000	215920	before Lafayette J. Honeycutt showed off his radical fucking jetpack.
215920	219600	And that certainly should've been the coolest thing in the episode.
219680	223600	But then, after finding a dead woman in the snow,
223600	226560	in a room upstairs with the window open,
226560	230560	Elden Ring reached out through the philanthropist's mind
230560	233680	to call out to the power he swore to help,
233680	236160	let himself be used as a vessel,
236160	240640	and psychic attack the top of Cicero Mordaunt's head off.
240640	245280	And now, using a word that encapsulates that scene,
245280	248080	it's Isabel Crane with Hollow.
248960	259840	I didn't know a body could be hollow before its blood ran cold
263520	274240	I didn't know that the wind could sew the tissue and ragged bone
274240	282240	You were hollow when you spoke to me
285200	288800	Hollow when you sang
292080	296880	I thought you might be starving
297680	307680	So I gave you everything
307680	311520	I feel like I'm presenting a children's show or something when I'm doing it.
311520	312400	You kinda are.
312400	314640	Yeah, you absolutely are.
316480	317600	That's how we promote the show.
317600	319040	Tell us the story, Scott!
320880	322720	It's an RPG show for kids.
322720	324800	Once upon a time, there was an inventor called Cicero Mordaunt,
325760	329360	and he made wonderful toys for all the boys and girls in the world.
329360	330400	What happened to his head?
336960	339280	He ended up a redhead at the end of the day.
341040	341920	Oh, man.
341920	344080	Yeah, Zach, you did something last episode.
344080	345600	Welcome to Pretending to Be People.
346320	350080	This is the fourth episode of The Thing You're Listening To.
350080	351360	Oh, yeah, Pretending to Be People.
351440	352000	I'm Zach.
352000	356080	I'm playing Elden Ring, and I did not kill anyone last episode.
356720	358160	Zach is not playing Elden Ring.
358160	362240	He doesn't play video games, but his character's name is Elden Ring.
362240	363760	Oh, that's why it's funny.
367440	369440	Like, I just thought it was a kick-ass name.
369440	370400	It is cool.
370400	372000	I've been hearing people saying it so often.
372000	373120	I thought I could use that.
373120	374080	I saw it on Twitter.
374800	376000	I thought it was a TikToker.
376640	377520	Luke, who are you playing?
377520	380320	I'm playing Checkers, a cult leader who talks like this.
380400	385680	He's only 19, and he is in the middle of climbing down some ladder rungs.
386400	387200	Is it going to be hard?
387920	390800	He passed it already, it seems like, so no.
390800	391680	All right, see you, Joe.
393680	395200	Yeah, I'm Harvey Brewer.
395200	399280	I'm a big, strong guy, but I hurt myself when I'm punching out a window upstairs up there.
400880	403200	After some difficulty, I made it down to the ground.
403200	408720	And my buddy here, my boss, he's an inventor,
408720	411840	and I just saw him take off in his new invention.
411840	414080	It's a sight to behold, I can tell you that much.
414720	418720	Well, and who knows where Lafayette J. Honeycutt is.
418720	422880	He was last seen flying off into the snowstorm with his jetpack.
422880	426560	Yeah, because there is no better time to test a prototype jetpack
427600	429280	than in a 50 or 60 mile per hour snowstorm.
429280	437920	Lafayette J. Honeycutt did not bring a prototype anything to upstage Cicero Mordent.
437920	439920	He brought a fully fleshed out.
439920	441840	Do you know how many Harveys died?
441840	443040	Do you know there's flesh on it?
443040	445840	How many Harveys crashed and burned in these things?
446960	448320	To get ready for this one?
448960	449460	Yeah.
451760	454080	Do you call it a jetpack, or do you have like a-
454080	455920	Do you call them all Harvey, or do they-
457360	460080	Do you think that my Harvey actually has tested this one,
460080	462320	and it's the one that worked, and that's why he's still with you?
462320	462720	Yeah.
462720	463840	Or have I not touched it yet?
463840	466480	No, you've tested it, and it could move your bulk around and everything.
467040	468480	He's like, this is the one.
470400	472880	Do you call it the jetpack, or do you have like a-
472880	475040	It's called the X1 right now, but-
475040	477040	It's not called the fuck you gravity.
479200	480400	It's a pretty cool name.
480400	481360	That is pretty cool.
483360	485440	This is my my fig.
488960	489460	FYG.
489460	490560	The fig X1.
492960	495120	Oh, that's it. I think that's who we are.
495120	500560	You probably are like binging all of these so you know what just happened,
500560	501680	but what just happened?
501680	503280	Okay, but I didn't kill anyone.
503280	504800	I, again-
504800	506080	You exploded his head.
506080	509360	Yeah, but again, because-
509360	511760	More manslaughter than murder because you didn't really want to do it.
511760	512960	How is it manslaughter?
514080	515760	A guy died because of him.
515760	516240	Exactly.
516240	518240	I was only a conduit, again.
518240	521840	That's like what you say like when you hit somebody with your car.
521840	523120	I was just a conduit.
526080	527280	Of the car's power.
535280	538240	It was just the thing working through me. It wasn't me.
538240	538740	Right.
539920	541040	My hands are clean.
541760	548240	It was an extreme instance of psychic croquet where you croquet a guy's head open.
549920	552160	You hit the ball a little too hard.
552160	556640	He is the ball in this, but he was hit. He's the implement of psychic croquet.
557680	564960	Scott, when the camera pans to Elden Ring, is he like covered in blood?
564960	567120	Oh, absolutely. Yeah, head to foot.
567120	571920	Well, not just blood, but cranial tissue and probably bits of skull as well.
571920	575680	I think we'll deal with the aftermath of that in a few moments.
576240	579120	Before then, I really want to catch up with Lafayette.
579120	579620	Me too.
580580	582420	Yes, I'm very intrigued.
582420	587060	I think we all would, but what if he just comes jetpacking through the window at the climax?
589860	590740	Oh no, you're not getting off that.
590740	592100	That's next episode.
595060	600980	So Lafayette is hurtling through the air in this experimental jetpack
602340	604740	in high winds and no visibility.
605540	608340	You have no real idea where you're going.
609620	613860	Do you want to give me a luck roll to see where you end up?
613860	619460	Instead of that, I'm going to spend 10 luck with resourceful,
619460	622020	and the jetpack has a built-in compass.
624020	627460	You should say a parachute too, just in case.
627460	630900	The jetpack is also an inspector gadget everything.
631540	632040	He is.
632500	633620	Inspector jetpack.
633620	635300	10 luck spent very well.
635300	641700	No, there is a little cool, like he used some of Mordaunt's radon dental paste
641700	645780	to make a glow-in-the-dark little display for his compass,
646340	649380	and so he's looking at it on his wrist,
649380	653220	and he's like guiding the jetpack straight towards the house.
653220	654660	As David Bowie plays.
654660	656660	Rocket man!
656740	661940	What skill do you suppose you use to control a jetpack in high winds and no visibility?
664660	666660	It's almost like you're swimming in the air.
667300	669220	Do you have like a skill for weird science?
671140	674500	No, that's a talent, and I think it gave me 10 in mythos.
674500	677060	Okay, so can you use like mechanical engineering?
677060	680980	I would like to argue that, but I bet it would be more like pilot.
680980	683700	Yeah, I think pilot would be about right.
683700	686020	Oh nice, so you have a base of 1% in that.
686020	689860	Yeah, I'm hoping that you've put points there, or you're really lucky.
689860	691700	Seeing as how you built yourself a jetpack,
693460	695140	it'd be weird if you didn't have points there.
695140	696340	I'm trying to find it on the sheet.
696340	700340	I thought you were trying to take points off of other skills and put them into pilot.
701700	703780	No, I'm not doing that to drive auto.
703780	706660	What would never happen is that he thought of the jetpack
706660	708340	as we were sitting down to record this.
708340	711540	There's no way that there's not a chance.
711540	718420	That is of course not what happened, which is why I have 55 in pilot and nothing in drive auto.
719780	722100	Wait, no, sorry, that's a baseline 20 in drive auto.
722100	725700	I have 35 in pilot, just enough to make it spicy.
725700	727460	Love it. That's spicy as hell, baby.
728420	730100	Let's see how this goes.
730100	730660	62.
731780	733380	That's too much.
733380	736420	Are we still playing 69 as crit goodness?
736420	736920	Always.
739780	741140	But it wasn't 69.
741140	742260	Nope, it was 62.
743140	745620	I played on another podcast recently that did that.
745620	747460	I can't remember which one it was.
747460	749540	It was our Scott, you're with us now.
751060	753940	No, this was like in the last two months.
753940	755220	They probably got it from us.
756660	758900	It's not like a really easy thing to think of.
760420	764180	Wait, could he gain seven luck and make his roll a 69?
768180	769540	That's the face of a yes.
770500	772260	That would put me at 29 luck.
773940	775220	No, you said Dane.
775220	778500	Yeah, you would gain seven because to add to your score.
779060	780180	Because you went up on the skill.
780180	782500	Right, because you want to add to the roll.
782500	784180	Right, to make it a 69.
784180	787380	So I gained seven luck and I make it a 69.
788740	789860	So we do that, Scott.
789860	790360	We do that.
791060	793060	Can I just cut all this short and say no?
796340	797860	You can lick whatever you want, but...
800500	801300	He let us lick.
802260	804580	The world had realistic consequences for it.
805300	806340	We got pretty lucky.
807300	812580	So yes, there you are barreling through the air in your jet pack,
812580	814820	unable to see where you're going.
814820	819060	You're getting thrown around by the winds.
819060	822020	It's almost completely uncontrollable at the moment.
822980	827780	But you are at least navigating in roughly the right direction.
828580	834500	But at the moment, it does look like your options are going to be limited
834500	840100	to trying to maybe land somewhere on the building.
840100	843860	But there's a good chance you'll just smack into the wall if you do that,
844740	846580	rather than, say, break through a window.
846580	849300	Because there is fundamentally a lot more wall than window.
849940	853060	Or you might be able to ditch the snowdrift if you're lucky
853060	854580	and you can find one deep enough.
854580	857620	You did say, since we had walked out to that tower,
857620	858820	a few feet had fallen, right?
859220	861460	Checkers was no longer able to see our footprints.
862660	866340	Was I knee-high in snow, walking out there?
866340	867780	Yeah, it was pretty much that.
867780	869700	And it's probably got deeper since then.
869700	871540	Keep in mind, I have a size 40.
873540	877060	On the other hand, you do know that there are quite a lot of cars parked outside.
877060	879700	So if you just plummeted in the wrong place,
879700	883380	you might end up having a rather hard landing.
883380	884740	Then here's what I'd like to do.
884740	890100	I would like to look for the tallest, fluffiest pine tree around here.
890100	891860	Presumably it's got, you know...
891860	894580	Oh, Montpelier pines are so fluffy.
895220	896100	They're so fluffy.
896820	898260	Especially when they're snow covered.
898260	898760	Exactly.
899380	902100	And I just kind of want to hug that bad boy.
902100	904820	I just want to like, I'm going to turn the engine off
904820	910660	and drift into a tree and try to hug it down.
911380	914340	That word drift is doing an awful lot of heavy lifting.
916900	921780	Because fundamentally, you're switching off the one thing that is keeping you up in the air.
921780	924660	And yeah, there are high winds.
924660	929940	Well, I see Scott, I didn't succeed in a pilot role when I tried to control it.
929940	932180	So I thought, what if I just don't?
933060	934260	Uncontrol it.
934260	939220	What we're hoping for here is like a Buzz Lightyear situation where he's not flying,
940180	942260	but falling with grace, or style.
942900	946900	I think this still comes down to a pushed piloting role here.
946900	947400	Awesome.
948020	954420	I mean, you know, if you succeed on this, you're going to land in your tree as you want.
954980	957060	If not, you're going to land somewhere else.
959540	960500	Fair enough.
960500	961780	How does pushed roles work?
961780	963460	You just roll it again on pilot.
964100	965460	And you can't spend luck on this.
966740	967380	Sixteen.
968020	968520	Yes!
970820	972020	Oh my God.
973140	977620	Starman, waiting in the sky.
984260	989380	As Lafayette glides gently into the tree and softly hugs it on the way down,
990020	992900	he just thinks about his kick-ass jetpack and he says,
992900	995700	this is going to blow Cicero's mind.
997380	1005700	So yes, I mean, the way that this has ended up is you've managed to grab hold of a branch
1005700	1010900	sticking out from a fairly large pine tree and you've shaken all the snow off it.
1010900	1014420	And it is bending nicely and easing you down a bit.
1015140	1021300	You can see that you're still a bit off the ground, but there is the roof of one of the
1021300	1024980	outbuildings that you might be able to drop onto as an intermediate point.
1024980	1027460	He says, tonight I will play the Santa Claus.
1027460	1031780	And he lands on the roof.
1031780	1032980	And he yells, parkour!
1032980	1034740	You utilized that last branch.
1035940	1041460	So you land on there and immediately send a flurry of snow falling off the roof.
1041460	1044340	You slide down a bit on some of the tiles.
1044340	1048580	It's not too heavily sloped and managed to just catch yourself in the guttering.
1049460	1053860	And that's the point at which you realize that you're not alone on the roof.
1055540	1056580	The flying pig!
1058660	1066020	There is something you can just make out this shape through the snow, this twisted dark
1066020	1072180	thing that you can just catch glimpses of it every now and then as the wind shifts,
1072820	1074260	but it's moving.
1074260	1075540	It's scuttling.
1075540	1076180	That's the word.
1076180	1079060	It's scuttling across the roof.
1079060	1083780	And you can see that it is leaving a trail of blood behind it in the snow.
1085140	1089220	And then it stops for a moment as you hit the guttering.
1089220	1091700	And at that point it seems to have noticed you.
1091700	1094580	And it is now scuttling in your direction.
1094580	1097220	Is this the building that everybody, all the...
1097860	1098420	The potty?
1099060	1100820	Yeah, is this a chauffeur party building?
1100820	1101940	It probably is.
1102740	1103860	You'd guess, maybe.
1103860	1107220	Someone outside yells, this is a great chauffeur party building!
1108260	1108740	I just...
1108820	1112500	Lafayette is terrified.
1112500	1114660	And he lets go of the gutter.
1115300	1117860	He just wants to drop and get away from this thing.
1117860	1121060	And he wants to then run into the chauffeur's party.
1121780	1126820	First thing, let's have a sand roll as you see this thing scuttling towards you.
1128340	1133700	His head looks all wrong and it looks like it's pulsating there in the gloom.
1133700	1138260	There's there's crenellations and ridges all over his head that are just throbbing.
1138340	1141940	And things sticking out, sharp things.
1141940	1143860	He hates it.
1143860	1147620	He is not down with this, but he passes his sand roll.
1147620	1152820	And he's like, I'm sorry to drop out so soon, old chap.
1152820	1155700	But well, and then he lets go.
1155700	1158100	Okay, give me a jump roll to have a graceful landing.
1159300	1160980	I don't think I have much of that.
1162020	1163940	Oh, that is a base plan.
1163940	1164500	What, 20?
1166340	1167380	Oh, 100.
1167380	1169140	Wait, what is zero, zero, zero, zero?
1169140	1170100	That's a hundred.
1170100	1170820	Oh my God.
1170820	1172100	That's a hundred.
1172100	1175140	So I think, so I think what happens.
1175140	1177140	Your bones go into your brain and you're dead.
1178020	1184580	You try to leap off the roof, but the cuff of your trousers gets caught in the guttering.
1184580	1188180	And you leap off and suddenly, I mean, you're there hanging by one leg,
1188180	1191140	swinging backwards and forwards like a screaming pendulum
1191140	1195860	as this thing scuttles across the roof towards you and looks down at you.
1198260	1199380	We'll come back to you in a moment.
1199380	1200820	Oh my God.
1203780	1207140	I will say the moment you said scuttles, I got goosebumps.
1209140	1211060	I wonder if that thing has too many legs.
1213300	1214900	That thing has two legs.
1218420	1219540	I wish it had none.
1220100	1229700	So, meanwhile, Checkers and Harvey had just finished climbing down the slippery,
1229700	1236020	now slightly blood splattered ladder and made it down to, I guess, the comparative safety
1236020	1236580	of the ground.
1237140	1241700	Yeah, as we get into the ground, I get down there and then I help Harvey down the last
1241700	1247540	few steps and I've got like quite a bit of blood on my face from it dripping down from you.
1248420	1248920	Yeah.
1249380	1253220	And your boss flew off.
1253220	1254180	Did you see which way he went?
1254180	1256100	We've got to catch up to him.
1256100	1262820	Would the light from, I feel like maybe the completely engulfed in flames tower light
1263940	1269140	have like illuminate the area enough for us to look around and see?
1269140	1273620	The way the buildings are laid out, he's on the other side at the moment.
1273620	1275460	So you wouldn't be able to see him from where you are.
1275460	1278980	But if you start moving up towards the main building, you could probably see him fairly
1278980	1279700	easily.
1279700	1286340	I think when I was climbing down, I think I saw him fly off that way towards the buildings.
1287220	1288340	Then let's head that direction then.
1288340	1290100	We got to catch up with the boss.
1290100	1291220	How's your arm?
1291220	1293860	Can we try to maybe fix that?
1293860	1295380	It's bleeding pretty bad.
1295380	1300180	I tore my sleeve off here and I put it down there on the last little accent.
1301140	1301620	Put it down there.
1301620	1304340	I put it on the cut.
1304340	1306420	I'm going to try to do a first aid on him.
1306420	1313220	In addition to the first aid, I'm going to use my resourceful talent to have some antiseptic
1313220	1314580	and bandages on me.
1314580	1314900	Okay.
1314900	1316500	So spend the 10 points of luck.
1316500	1317220	Okay.
1317220	1318740	That puts me at 22.
1318740	1322020	So okay.
1322020	1323540	Someone's not getting out of this alive.
1324500	1327140	35 on a 50 first aid.
1327140	1328820	So yeah, you managed to patch that up.
1329060	1334500	You are helped as well by the comparatively bright light of the burning tower above your
1334500	1334740	head.
1335460	1336180	Perfect.
1336180	1343380	However, there is this nasty cracking creaking sound from the burning timbers above you.
1343380	1350020	And there are little bits of burning debris that are beginning to fall down like Satan's
1350020	1351140	own hell stones.
1353460	1357780	I pour the like hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol that I have on you.
1357780	1362660	I bandage your arm up and then I like tenderly like put my hands around your arm and I look
1362660	1366740	at you and say, you can take the last branch for that.
1367460	1368180	Now let's run.
1368980	1369860	I owe you one, buddy.
1369860	1371540	That feels so much better.
1371540	1372580	What was that voice?
1372580	1373540	Oh shit.
1374420	1375620	I owe you one, buddy.
1375620	1377140	That feels so much better.
1377780	1379060	He's just excited.
1379060	1380020	I owe you one, buddy.
1380020	1381220	It's so much better feeling now.
1381220	1381620	Thanks.
1382260	1382660	Fuck.
1382660	1385700	Just remember, uh, the last branch helped you.
1385700	1388660	Now let's run that way and hope that we don't get crushed.
1388660	1392740	Yeah, we're taking off running and I I'm kind of trusting him at this point to just know
1392740	1394420	where, what he's doing to get out of there.
1394420	1394580	Yeah.
1394580	1400900	I mean, running might be an overstatement for how you're going to try not to fall down.
1400900	1406820	But yeah, you, you Trump your way through the snow and there are larger and larger bits
1406820	1410580	falling off the burning tower now smacking into the snow around you.
1411300	1417780	And as you make your way into the courtyard, the courtyard, I'll tell you what, give me
1417780	1418100	a spot.
1418100	1418660	Hit and roll.
1419300	1419780	Both of us.
1420580	1420900	Yeah.
1422580	1422900	Fuck.
1423780	1425380	I got an 84 on a 70.
1425380	1426980	I got a 78 on a 40.
1427940	1434420	Then yeah, you, you, you obliviously walk past the house where the party's going on
1434420	1436580	and just miss the swinging form of Lafayette.
1437540	1438580	Holy shit.
1441380	1446980	I was really counting on that.
1446980	1448580	It's a snow whip around.
1448580	1454500	As they like run out of the area, like where they would be smashed by the tower, Checkers
1454500	1458740	turns around and is just kind of like walking backwards through the snow, like looking at
1458740	1461700	the tower as it's like collapsing on itself.
1461700	1466180	So oblivious, pretty good distraction, oblivious to everything else around him.
1466180	1471220	Well, and so obviously from that angle, my silhouette would be perfectly illuminated
1471220	1471860	as he turns around.
1471860	1475220	I was about to say, if you want to use that as the basis for a pushed.
1475220	1477540	Yes, I do want to use that as a basis for a push.
1479940	1482500	And that is a 51 on a 40.
1482500	1483940	Can we both push it?
1483940	1485860	Can I push it for the same reason too, right?
1486660	1487540	Did Harvey look at all?
1488660	1493220	Why not be hilarious to have you both fail at the same time?
1493220	1496180	I pass my 25 on a 70.
1496180	1502740	Just through the shrill, like shriek of the wind, you hear like, Harvey, Harvey.
1502740	1506820	And like a dog hearing its name, I shoot my head around, pointed right at it.
1507460	1510740	Well, I was about to say, you see a few different things.
1510740	1514980	So, you know, I mean, they're in the light from the burning tower and also from the light
1514980	1519940	coming out of the house where, or the outbuilding rather, where the chauffeurs were having their
1519940	1520660	little party.
1521540	1527700	You can just see the outline of Lafayette in his jet pack, swinging backwards and forwards
1527700	1528820	by one leg.
1528820	1535380	There is something above him, but you can also see through the windows of the house
1535380	1536180	behind him.
1537140	1541300	You can see blood sprayed all over the windows.
1545460	1549140	And yeah, I mean, that's the point at which you cat's eye to the thing that is scuttling
1549140	1551380	down over Lafayette.
1551380	1553220	Do you want to give me a sand roll for all this?
1558260	1561060	That's a super duper pass, a three on a 60.
1561060	1563300	Okay, so you don't lose any sand for that.
1563300	1570420	So you're in a position to act, but Checkers, having failed that push, I think you're standing
1570420	1575140	there as well, looking back at this tower and it's beautiful, isn't it?
1575140	1577620	Just the way the fire is burning there.
1578340	1582340	Steam is coming off of it as the snow falls down into the fire.
1583380	1584340	Oh, it's gorgeous.
1584340	1586900	I mean, it's almost transfixing, isn't it?
1586900	1592100	And it's really easy to stand there just for that moment too long as some of the larger
1592100	1594500	timbers start falling down in your direction.
1594500	1594740	Right.
1594740	1598660	And it's almost as if every single one of my senses is focused on this.
1598660	1602180	The only thing I can hear is the crackling of the fire in the wood.
1602180	1606420	The only thing I can see is the beauty of the tower on fire.
1606420	1611460	I stick my tongue out and snow falls on it and I'm like, that tastes cold.
1612020	1613700	But what I'm looking at is hot.
1614660	1619940	And I feel the warmth from the fire as it radiates off the tower.
1621060	1625140	But the tower at this stage and the strong winds is rocking backwards and forwards.
1625140	1631460	And as you stand there looking at it, you can see it's moving and it's toppling and
1631460	1635620	it's toppling and Jesus Christ, it's coming straight for you.
1635700	1637620	Oh my God.
1638820	1640260	Is it going to hit the creature?
1640260	1645140	What is my sense of like, if I didn't move right now, would it fall right on me?
1646100	1648100	I mean, if you want to stand there, we try to work it out.
1652420	1654260	You did fail a push-draw, right?
1654260	1658980	I'm going to say that I'm pretty freaking transfixed on this thing and it's hard to
1658980	1660660	move around in this snow, so.
1660660	1663540	All right, so you're not going to try to dodge out of the way.
1663540	1664980	You're just going to stand there and let it hit you.
1664980	1670580	I'm going to continue moving backwards at the same pace I was, but there's like no
1670580	1673380	sense of urgency in my movements.
1673380	1674580	So you're not trying to dodge it?
1675300	1675620	No.
1675620	1679460	Yeah, really make a point about how you're not trying to dodge the huge tower coming
1679460	1682020	down on you when you don't have enough luck to stay alive.
1682020	1684500	Yeah, maybe without all your luck, it'll still Buster King you.
1684500	1688740	Maybe once it gets close to me, it might snap me out of my way.
1688740	1690260	Oh yeah, maybe you should dodge.
1690260	1694340	From the point it starts falling, there isn't going to be a hell of a lot of time before
1694340	1695700	it's actually on you.
1695700	1696420	How about this?
1696420	1698820	Yeah, I won't dodge because I just failed my dodge roll.
1701300	1701800	Okay.
1703300	1704740	So yeah, no attempt made.
1704740	1705460	By how much?
1706020	1707220	51 out of 25.
1708020	1709060	Oh fuck.
1709060	1709780	I could.
1709780	1711060	Yeah, spend it all.
1711060	1712020	Or could I push?
1712820	1713700	But then I might die.
1714420	1718820	Yeah, you can't really push this because this is a, you know, it's not an action you
1718820	1719940	can really retry.
1719940	1722900	Um, do I have enough luck to, I don't think I do.
1723860	1725220	Uh, 22.
1725220	1726100	22.
1726100	1728500	You failed by 26.
1728500	1729380	So now I can't.
1729380	1729880	Yeah.
1730980	1736980	Okay, well then these burning timbers just start crashing all around you.
1737620	1743060	The structure atop the tower falls off to one side and explodes in a shower of sparks.
1743700	1746980	The timbers though are falling hard and heavy around you.
1747540	1751380	And one of them does hit you because you don't manage to get out of the way.
1752100	1753620	And you take.
1756500	1758020	Oh, that face.
1758020	1759620	My health plus five damage.
1761380	1763460	You take, you take 11 hit points of damage.
1765940	1770260	Or wax into you and, and it drives you into the snow drift.
1770260	1774660	You are simultaneously freezing and burning at the same time.
1775460	1782980	Oh, that drops me down considerably, but I'm not stunned or anything.
1783620	1785540	Is it more than half your hit points?
1785540	1789700	Almost very almost 23 or 24.
1789700	1792100	I had 24 and that was 11 damage, right?
1792900	1793300	Okay.
1793300	1793860	Okay.
1793860	1796580	So yeah, I'm down to 13.
1796580	1801620	But you are at least partially pinned under this burning timber.
1801620	1804020	So it's like a huge plank of wood.
1804020	1809940	Basically, yeah, one of the, one of the struts that was supporting the tower is broken up
1809940	1814500	into pieces because of the fire, but this is a fairly big pole or whatever that, that
1814500	1815300	has landed on you.
1816020	1820020	I mean, the good news is that you have a very strong man.
1823060	1825700	The bad news is I think he might be preoccupied.
1826820	1828900	Well, what I want to do if I'm able to.
1830180	1830820	Harvey!
1831780	1832260	Fuck it.
1832260	1833140	Harvey!
1833140	1833620	Harvey!
1833620	1834100	Help me!
1835940	1839700	And I'm assuming Lafayette shouting pretty much the same thing at the same time.
1839700	1843140	Can I do like a charm roll to charm Harvey into helping me?
1846020	1850420	I want to do a fast talk roll to talk faster and get more Harveys out.
1850420	1850580	Okay.
1850580	1853460	I'm going to, can I charm his fast talk?
1853460	1857140	Do you want to make an opposed roll to see which one of you is making the more compelling
1857140	1857460	arc?
1857460	1857620	Yeah.
1859940	1861620	68 on an 80 fast talk.
1861860	1865380	Ooh, you win 25 on a, on an 80.
1865380	1865780	Harvey!
1865780	1866100	Harvey!
1866100	1866500	Harvey!
1866500	1867860	I'm asking you very quickly.
1867860	1868660	I think he wins.
1868660	1869060	Yeah.
1869060	1869940	Oh wait, this is lower?
1869940	1870180	Yeah.
1870180	1870580	Yeah.
1870580	1871780	Lower is good in this game.
1871780	1872900	Oh, it's good in this game.
1872900	1875460	It's the hard success versus just a regular success.
1875460	1876660	Then, uh, fuck that.
1876660	1880180	I mean, I mean, I mean, it is still obviously, yeah.
1880740	1882980	Up to you, Harvey, which one do you follow?
1882980	1888340	But it certainly sounds like from, from the cries that are reaching you, it sounds like
1888340	1889780	checkers is far more in need.
1889780	1891060	Harvey, look at your arm!
1891620	1895060	And help me!
1897380	1900580	How far off the ground is Lafayette compared to us?
1900580	1906260	He's probably only about five or six feet off the ground, but it's just, it's just the
1906260	1912980	fact that he's hanging by an ankle while this creature is starting to crawl over him.
1912980	1913540	Oh shit.
1913540	1917380	If he's that close to the ground, I think Harvey's instinct would be to help his boss
1917380	1921460	by trying to just grab his ankle and pull it off the scaffolding.
1921460	1924900	Do you at least give like a caring look toward...
1924900	1925700	Well, that's what I'm saying.
1925700	1927140	I didn't realize he was that close to the ground.
1927140	1928500	I think I can try and do both.
1929140	1932740	I mean, you could do both if they weren't like 20 feet apart.
1933860	1937380	It's just moving backwards and forwards between them through the heavy snow is going to take
1937380	1938500	such a long time.
1938500	1940100	You can't help both of them.
1940100	1941380	Harvey, your arm!
1941380	1942100	I helped you!
1942660	1943220	Help me!
1943780	1948180	And if he's that far away, I'm going to, I'm going to, I think, turn to the guy who's yelling
1948180	1953140	at me closest to me right now and I'm going to, I want to rip the other sleeve off of
1953140	1960660	my other arm and I want to create like oven mitts now that I've got a fiery thing I got
1960660	1963140	to pull off a guy and yeah, I want to try and move it off of him.
1963140	1965540	And you're going to try to lift this large burning...
1965540	1969780	Could I like roll to help him by like pushing...
1969780	1970820	You certainly can.
1970820	1974740	Yeah, I mean, if you give me a strength roll and if it's a pass, you can give them a, it
1974740	1976740	will take the difficulty level down by one.
1976740	1977220	Cool.
1977220	1977540	Okay.
1977540	1981540	I got a 25 on a 60 for my strength roll.
1982660	1985140	So that's going to be a straight strength roll for Harvey.
1985140	1985780	No!
1985780	1986980	I, uh, I fail it.
1986980	1988260	It's a 97 on a 90.
1988260	1990980	So I'm going to use seven luck to just make it a success.
1990980	1991300	Nice.
1991300	1992980	Oh, thank goodness.
1992980	1997460	So yeah, you managed to, I mean, luckily using your, your oven mitts, you managed to avoid
1997460	1998980	burning your hands too much.
1998980	2000980	And yeah, it's, I mean, it's difficult at first.
2000980	2003380	This is a really big, heavy timber.
2003380	2005060	And I mean, it's on fire.
2005060	2007300	It doesn't open up at all.
2007300	2011780	But somehow, yeah, you put in almost a superhuman amount of strength.
2012500	2012740	Yeah.
2012740	2015780	I mean, it's obviously down to the great first aid that checkers gave you.
2017780	2019060	You wouldn't have stood a chance.
2019620	2019940	Yeah.
2019940	2023380	So like we were, as I'm like pushing up and he's lifting up.
2023380	2024660	Come on buddy, push!
2024660	2025780	Push with all your might!
2025780	2030340	I'm barely able to, like with the, the snow is melting underneath the fire.
2030340	2035220	It's melted just enough that I can slide right out and we drop the, drop the log.
2036660	2038340	And, and, and will you drop your log?
2038340	2041460	Let's, let's go to Lafayette and see whether you still have a boss.
2043380	2044180	Yeah.
2044180	2046340	Well, Lafayette doesn't know if he still has a Harvey.
2046340	2050340	He sees him go to help him and he's like, he's almost as pissed as he was at Morden.
2051220	2052260	You can have my guy.
2052260	2053220	We'll just switch guys.
2056020	2060500	I've lost three of my best friends recently and I'm looking for a new master.
2060500	2063220	Your guy is weird.
2064980	2066180	The old guy is weird.
2067540	2067860	Okay.
2068580	2068740	Yeah.
2068740	2075940	I mean, there you are swinging by your, your trouser calf off this, uh, off this gutter.
2075940	2082740	And this creature now has, has crawled down and is beginning to move its way down your body.
2083460	2089620	You can see his hideous misshapen head pulsing in the light that's coming from the windows
2089620	2090900	and from the burning structure.
2091780	2095220	Lafayette ignites the jet pack and tries to push off.
2095780	2098900	And he hopes that breaks the thread on his trousers.
2098900	2102180	So are you, if you're hanging upside down, there's a chance that this,
2102180	2104180	no, I'm going to try to push off as I do it.
2104180	2107780	But I thought you were trying to burn the creature sideways.
2107780	2108280	Oh yeah.
2108820	2112500	I think there's many things that can be happening all at once here.
2113140	2115700	Well, do you want to give me a piloting role then?
2115700	2118020	I think if it's a regular success, you're pushing away.
2118020	2120420	And if it's a hard success, you can try igniting the creature.
2120420	2121140	Oh, piloting.
2121140	2121380	Yeah.
2121380	2122660	I have a 55 in that.
2122660	2128660	So it was, it was, it was, it was 35, 35, 35, two, two.
2128660	2129460	You rolled a two.
2129460	2130020	I rolled a two.
2132660	2133780	Oh my God.
2133780	2135540	Extreme success.
2135540	2138420	Like a jet pack fart in the face.
2138420	2143940	And as you're pushing off and taking off, it seems to be trying to take off after you,
2143940	2148660	but yeah, your jet catches it straight on and you can see fire engulf it.
2148660	2153060	And yeah, just a sizzling sound as it falls down to the snow and twitches there.
2156100	2157140	Happy new year chap.
2157140	2161940	And I do a flip in the air and land next to Harvey and checkers.
2163220	2164180	Fuck yes.
2164740	2169140	And I think that's a good point to cut back to Mr. Ring.
2169140	2172180	Hello, bright light in the, in the wardrobe.
2172180	2178100	I, I've lost three of my best friends recently and I'm looking for a new master.
2178100	2183140	I think along with the three of your best friends, let's see whether you've lost any
2183140	2188340	San for all this, because this is a lot that's going on at the moment.
2188340	2189460	It's a lot.
2189460	2190660	54 on a 90.
2191220	2191700	Okay.
2191700	2193540	You still lose one point of San.
2193540	2194100	Okay.
2194340	2195940	Cause he accidentally popped ahead.
2195940	2201620	So we got to, he croquered ahead.
2202740	2206580	I do want to luck roll as well, just to see whether you've been injured by any of the
2206580	2208340	bits of flying cranium.
2208340	2209220	Oh, that's a fail.
2209220	2209780	93.
2210900	2211380	Okay.
2211380	2213300	He created a frag grenade skull.
2216340	2218740	Think of the infection you're going to get from that.
2219460	2220740	That's three points of damage.
2220820	2224740	So yeah, I mean, you can feel a sting in your, your cheek.
2224740	2229460	And, and as, as you reach up, you can feel that there's something hard stuck in your
2229460	2229940	cheek.
2229940	2236260	My beautiful face has been tainted forever by me being the psychic conduit for the, the
2236260	2240420	cattywampus game of a croquet that's been played through my mind.
2243940	2247460	And yeah, I mean, if you, if you pull this, this loose, you can see that it's a bit of
2247460	2250180	a high socket and there's, there's a bit of a high in it as well.
2250820	2252660	Oh my God.
2252660	2254020	Embedded into your face.
2254020	2255540	Now you've got an actual third eye.
2255540	2256260	So it works out.
2258820	2264980	The physical realm, the physical realm is not nothing in the physical, nothing in the
2264980	2266260	physical realm can hurt me.
2269140	2271380	Margaret Payne has liked it at this stage.
2271380	2276420	And how many legs, how many legs did she do it?
2276420	2284420	You can hear this buzzing from inside the wardrobe, or at least very deep inside the
2284420	2288020	wardrobe, it sounds like, which again just goes, release me.
2288980	2290900	How would I do that, my new friend?
2290900	2294900	I mean, there's, there's no direct response to that.
2294900	2300180	Yeah, well, you get the impression from the acoustics that that voice is coming from
2300180	2301540	quite some distance away.
2301540	2305060	The powers that possess the world help those who help themselves.
2305780	2310580	All right, well, I will be on my way then.
2310580	2312500	Bright light in the wardrobe.
2312500	2312980	Really?
2312980	2313940	You're not going to do it?
2314580	2315060	Do what?
2315620	2316660	Open the wardrobe?
2317220	2318580	It is already open.
2318580	2319540	The wardrobe's open.
2319540	2321540	I mean, you can already see the light coming out of it.
2321540	2321860	Yeah.
2321860	2326820	I'm not, I don't feel, it did not tell me to step into it nor reach into it nor throw
2326820	2328100	any body into it.
2328100	2329540	So what if Narnia is back there?
2329540	2329780	Yeah.
2332340	2333060	Grew up, Christian.
2333060	2333460	You love that.
2335780	2339140	All right, so did Elden Ring, actually.
2339140	2341300	He's a PK from Kentucky.
2341300	2342260	A preacher's kid?
2342900	2345540	Yeah, he's a preacher's kid from Kentucky.
2345540	2347060	Is that what you say on the boards?
2348900	2351220	Yeah, when we're talking about all of our religious trauma.
2353700	2357460	So, so does that mean you're not investigating the wardrobe or you are?
2357460	2361140	Well, I'd like to if, if it would give me any sort of direction.
2361140	2363700	I am one who follows direction well.
2363700	2367700	You can hear when the voice is coming from somewhere deep within the wardrobe.
2367700	2370260	Are you there, my dear master, sir?
2370260	2373140	Are you saying that in the conversational tone or are you shouting?
2373140	2378740	He's reaching his head towards the light to kind of like poke its head in to say it.
2378740	2382020	Yeah, I mean, I mean, as you look into the water, go into the water, you can see that
2382020	2388180	what it is is there's a false door or secret door in the back of it that seems to go to
2388180	2390180	a staircase that's leading down.
2390180	2396980	I'm no lion as I am not strong in physical strength, but I can be a witch.
2396980	2399940	And he walks into the wardrobe.
2401700	2402900	C.S. Lewis.
2403780	2405940	There are these wooden steps leading down.
2405940	2410260	There's a fair bit of light coming from down below and you can hear this.
2411140	2413140	Oh, it's my voice breaking up again.
2413140	2414260	I just got good.
2414260	2416820	I'm just like getting fucked, man.
2416820	2419700	I'm just like ready for it.
2420180	2422260	I'll say that again to make it easier for you to edit.
2422260	2422980	Appreciate you.
2422980	2424100	Yeah, you head down.
2424100	2426660	There's a set of wooden stairs that are going down.
2426660	2430740	There's brick lined walls and you can see light coming from down below.
2430740	2434740	And there's this rattling sound as well, sound like metal rattling.
2434740	2441220	And this this buzzing voice again saying, Releasing.
2441220	2442500	Yes, OK, I hear you.
2442500	2443540	Calm down.
2443540	2444260	I'm so sorry.
2445780	2448340	You seem very perturbed by this whole situation.
2448340	2449940	May I ask you a few questions?
2449940	2450980	Who is that?
2450980	2453060	That is that is not Mordant.
2453780	2454740	Who are you?
2454740	2456660	No, we destroyed Mordant together.
2460260	2461620	There's a pause there.
2461620	2463300	Mordant is dead?
2463300	2464260	Well, yes, of course.
2464820	2467860	Through the power invested in me from you.
2468900	2469220	Good.
2470180	2471940	Then you must release me.
2471940	2472580	Yeah, all right.
2474660	2475540	Okie dokie.
2475540	2476180	Yeah, sure.
2476180	2483620	OK, and as you make your way to the bottom of the stairs, you can see that it opens up
2483620	2490500	into what looks like a laboratory or a workshop of some kind, that there are workbenches
2490500	2495700	with all sorts of strange equipment and kind of half-finished devices, inventions.
2495700	2497220	You know, you're not quite sure.
2497860	2503300	There's a big freestanding, what looks like electrical loom that's got all sorts of
2503300	2504580	strange wiring on it.
2505940	2512260	But the thing that attracts your attention the most is in the center of the room, you
2512260	2517540	bolted to the floor is something that looks almost like a medieval torture device made
2517540	2518500	of black iron.
2519860	2523140	And there is something that is bolted within it.
2523940	2533460	This strange, twisted, insectile-like thing, it has too many legs and it has claws and
2533460	2538980	pincers and things sticking out of its head and its head is pulsating.
2538980	2540340	You can't see any eyes.
2540340	2543460	You can't even really see anything you can identify as a mouth.
2546580	2548340	Do you want to give me a SAN roll?
2548340	2548840	Yeah.
2549560	2550060	I do.
2551400	2554440	That's 11 on an 89.
2554440	2555160	Yes, yeah.
2555160	2556840	Somehow you're taking this in your stride.
2557960	2559560	Okay, all right.
2559560	2565320	Hello there, future bug master and overlord, perhaps.
2565320	2567560	I have a question for you.
2567560	2576440	I'm a very passionate voter and so I would like to know what platforms you are interested
2576440	2582360	in paying attention to if you are going to take over humanity, which is just an assumption
2582360	2584120	is my thought of your goal.
2584120	2587640	I have no interest in taking over your pitiful species.
2588360	2591560	Release me now and you shall be spared it.
2591560	2596360	So does that involve the killing of the rest of the people like me?
2596360	2598600	Only those who get in my way.
2598600	2600200	And what is the end goal?
2600200	2602360	My goal is to be released.
2602920	2604600	Well, sure, for now that's short term.
2604600	2606600	What is your long term goal, please, mister?
2610600	2615320	There is this long pause as it is trying to process what the fuck you're saying.
2616520	2619640	It's rattling this iron cage that it's stuck in.
2619640	2623720	The other thing you can see now that you're a bit closer in talking to this is that it
2623720	2625720	looks really badly hurt.
2625720	2628120	A few of its limbs seem to be broken.
2628120	2630360	There are wounds all over its carapace.
2631080	2633960	It looks like it has wings, but the wings look damaged.
2634440	2642680	But the worst of all is, yeah, this sort of brainy looking head that it's got covered
2642680	2647480	in crenellations has got holes in it.
2647480	2650440	It looks like holes have been drilled into its head.
2651000	2656600	And you can see crusted around some of the holes, this sort of yellowish pus.
2656600	2658520	Oh, my God.
2658520	2663000	Hey, I was just wondering, you seem to be in pretty bad shape.
2663000	2665480	Do you think that that would make you any less...
2665480	2667640	Psychic attack, psychic attack, psychic attack!
2671240	2674360	You can try to psychic attack it by your means.
2676680	2677880	Oh, fucking shit.
2677880	2679560	71 on a 90.
2679560	2680600	Normal success.
2680600	2683400	Oh, yeah, that's an extreme success on this path.
2686040	2688520	So what happens if your opponent bests you?
2689160	2689560	Sorry?
2689560	2692760	So what happens if your opponent bests you at this contest?
2693080	2699960	Psychic powers, psychic attack, allowing heroes to use psychic attack.
2699960	2702920	Is this a monster or a mythos monster?
2703560	2704760	It's a mythos monster.
2704760	2707560	Psychic attacks do not work on mythos monsters.
2713160	2717960	So not only have you failed on basic terms, but they wouldn't have worked even if you
2717960	2718680	succeeded.
2718680	2723960	The minds of mythos monsters are so alien that to connect with them is to risk losing
2723960	2725640	one's own mind.
2725640	2730840	A human attempting to psychically attack a mythos monster must immediately make a sanity
2730840	2735720	roll, taking the standard sanity loss as described in the monster's profile.
2735720	2740120	So it means that you could take the same sanity roll twice for seeing them and then trying
2740120	2740680	to connection.
2741000	2749400	Then you get all these impressions as you dig into its mind of just darkness and these
2749400	2757480	strange alien minds and moving through interstellar space and flying just through space, through
2757480	2761320	all these places that the angles don't quite work right.
2761320	2764360	I rolled a 94 on an 89.
2764360	2772280	Oh, and you lose six points of sand.
2775320	2777160	Do you want to give me an intelligence roll?
2780760	2783320	Oh, 28 pass on a 50.
2783320	2784440	It's probably bad for you.
2785640	2788040	The good news is to get five points of Cthulhu mythos.
2788040	2791880	The bad news is you're having a battle of madness and you're having one where there
2791880	2793320	are no other player characters around.
2794680	2796280	Summary rules for that.
2796280	2801160	So let's just draw a curtain on what happens here and we'll come back to you shortly to
2801160	2802760	see what's happened.
2803640	2805800	Hey, Scott, thank you.
2808440	2809720	I'm really happy right now.
2809720	2817640	I like that we learned in real time that what you did was a horrible decision to think back
2817640	2821640	on how much glee we had when you shouted psychic attack and the way that it ended up.
2824840	2827720	Whoops, you've gone mad.
2827720	2830200	And so you're just repeatedly trying to psychic attack.
2831160	2832120	Oh God.
2832120	2834360	Now, meanwhile, back out in the courtyard.
2835000	2842600	Yeah, there's there's bits of burning debris all around now, which are lighting the courtyard
2843240	2844440	quite nicely.
2844440	2850280	And you can see that there are more of these flying creatures, some of them moving through
2850280	2850680	the air.
2850680	2852920	Some have landed on the roofs.
2852920	2859320	You can see some scuttling in through windows on the manor house and the air around you
2859320	2860120	is buzzing.
2863240	2864440	Holy shit.
2864440	2867480	Well, I don't know about you fellas, but I think we ought to get up there and kill that
2867480	2869800	thing in the wardrobe in the bedroom.
2873800	2879720	OK, now that I've been rescued from underneath the burning log and I've got burns and shit
2879720	2882120	all over me and I've seen this crazy shit.
2882680	2889480	I immediately start to miss Eldon and I'm like, yeah, he actually believes in the shit
2889480	2892280	that I was trying to peddle and it's happening now.
2893160	2893480	Fuck.
2894120	2899640	And he's just going to run towards the entrance of the main house to try to go find Eldon.
2899640	2901080	Harvey's just going to turn to Lafayette.
2901080	2903000	Hey, boss, I think it's time we get out of here.
2903000	2905000	I think that's a capital idea, Harvey.
2905000	2907160	Do you think we could get one of these cars going?
2908120	2911240	I don't think any of these cars are moving into some of the snow melts.
2911240	2915240	I think our best bet is to seek refuge inside, maybe find the wine cellar.
2915240	2921320	As Checkers is running off, he's like, don't you want to show your that the scientist how
2921320	2922600	much better you are than him?
2924600	2928040	You know, perhaps tomorrow when things have calmed down, but there are an awful lot of,
2929080	2931000	you know, demons in the air.
2934440	2935560	Demons in the air.
2938120	2941960	Yeah, I'm following Lafayette's lead no matter what, but I think we're aiming for the house.
2941960	2944520	I mean, we're running after you all the same.
2945560	2948120	So, yeah, you make your way as quickly as you can through the snow.
2948920	2952440	Actually, each of you could give me a spot hidden roll on your way past if you want.
2953240	2953880	Ought 7.
2954440	2955000	25.
2955000	2955560	OK.
2955560	2957240	A 14 on a 70.
2957240	2959640	That's the extreme, extreme success.
2959640	2964280	You all notice as you're going past, at least parts of the cars that are parked outside
2965240	2968200	seem to be relatively cleared of snow.
2968200	2972440	In fact, it mostly seems to be the fronts of the cars.
2972440	2978200	Now you look at it, the hoods are open and there are bits of engine just strewn all over
2978200	2979000	the place.
2979000	2980280	Oh, shit.
2980280	2983080	Looks like snow is the least of our troubles with these autos, Harvey.
2983640	2985560	Yeah, we ain't going anywhere in any of these.
2985560	2986120	Eldon!
2988840	2993800	So, yeah, I mean, you make your way towards the house and as you get in through the main
2993800	3000680	doors, you can see coming down the stairs at the far end of the hallway, there's a few
3000680	3002600	of the staff who stopped and just looking.
3002600	3003720	There's Margaret Payne.
3005080	3011320	She's walking fairly slowly down the stairs and she is absolutely covered in blood with
3011320	3012680	grey specks on her.
3013720	3020360	She's got a thousand yard stare in her eyes and she's just swaying as she's coming
3020360	3020680	down.
3021240	3024280	Ms. Payne, have you seen Eldon?
3025720	3026920	He killed Cicero.
3027720	3028920	He killed Cicero.
3028920	3029800	He killed...
3029800	3030360	Where?
3030360	3031560	He did what?
3031560	3035960	She just points upstairs and then just faints dead away and bounces down the rest of the
3035960	3036520	stairs.
3036520	3037320	Oh, shit.
3037320	3042680	Lafayette is bounding up the stairs where she pointed three at a time.
3042680	3044040	Checkers is following after him.
3044040	3044760	Same with Harvey.
3044760	3048440	He's like, maybe he's not dead yet and he can see my jet pack before.
3048920	3054920	It's the last thing he sees as I hold his hand and I'm like, look, look, Cicero.
3056920	3059320	And then he's gone and then I piss on his bed.
3063320	3069400	As he's dying, he looks up to you with a tear in his eyes and he's like, you were better.
3072040	3075240	Yeah, he says this with no eyeballs and no head.
3075960	3079160	This is all in Lafayette's imagination as he's running up the stairs.
3079160	3080680	He says, I never hated you.
3080680	3082200	I just loved your wife.
3084440	3091160	It's the look in the eye that's still embedded in Mr. Ring's cheek.
3094520	3098200	I'm shouting Eldon's name as I'm running up the stairs too.
3098200	3098760	Do it.
3098760	3103560	I mean, yeah, you can see that there's light coming down from the end of the corridor and
3103560	3108040	probably more importantly, there is a trail of bloody footprints coming down the corridor
3108040	3109720	from this room at the end.
3109720	3111960	Yeah, that's what Checkers is going to be following.
3111960	3117480	You get in there and I mean, as bad as the wallpaper in this room probably looked before,
3117480	3118760	it looks a lot worse now.
3120200	3126280	There is blood and brain and bits of skin and bone just splattered around the place
3126280	3135880	like pebble dash, the almost headless body of Cicero leaking blood into the carpet.
3135880	3141400	And from down below you can hear this heavy clanking sound and something heavy falling
3141400	3150360	over and this buzzing voice saying, yes, yes, you shall be spared, you shall be spared,
3150360	3151480	you and you alone.
3152440	3155240	Checkers runs towards that.
3155240	3163080	Lafayette dips his finger in some of the blood on the wallpaper and takes a lick and he knows.
3163080	3164120	He knows it's Cicero.
3166600	3167400	It's cold.
3167400	3173400	He sits down for a moment next to the corpse on the bed and he doesn't really know what
3173400	3174120	to do with his life.
3176120	3182520	I mean, there is still this bottle of strange yellowish liquid there and a hypodermic syringe
3183080	3183560	as well.
3187400	3189480	Yeah, this is rock bottom.
3189480	3190680	I should probably start injecting.
3193000	3199400	Scott's just like, well, here we go.
3199400	3200600	Having a rough night?
3205640	3207240	The next logical step for you.
3209480	3211480	Harvey standing over Morden's body.
3211960	3213480	Well, this is good news, right?
3213480	3215480	This is the kind of the end game here, right?
3215480	3216760	You win.
3216760	3217160	You won.
3217160	3217880	You won.
3217880	3218760	Harvey, don't you see?
3218760	3222280	I wanted to rub his nose in it and now he doesn't have one.
3222280	3222920	Well, you can do that.
3222920	3223480	Here, look.
3224840	3227000	And I start to rub his skull.
3227000	3229240	Rubbing his nose in it.
3229240	3229800	That's lovely.
3229800	3231480	That's the half of a skull.
3232680	3237320	So it's just Checkers who's running downstairs and the other two of you are commiserating
3237320	3239800	over Morden's corpse upstairs.
3239800	3240920	Yeah, you've got this, right, Checkers?
3241640	3243400	Oh, I've never been more ready.
3244360	3245720	We'll start moseying on down there.
3246280	3254760	You run downstairs and there is this horrible buzzing sound, the sound like the one you
3254760	3255560	heard outside.
3255560	3262280	And sure enough, when you come around the corner, there is this battered form of this
3262280	3269320	creature like the one you saw outside or the ones you saw outside that is beginning to
3269320	3275640	rise off the ground and there on the ground before it, kneeling almost in reverence,
3276200	3278280	is the form of Mr.
3278280	3278600	Ring.
3279560	3279880	Mr.
3279880	3286040	Ring is coming back to his senses now, I guess, but how this has affected you, how this
3286040	3290360	glimpse of seeing something so much greater than yourself is shaping your thoughts at
3290360	3292040	the moment is entirely up to you.
3292040	3294440	Is this thing still inside the cage?
3294440	3294680	No.
3295480	3296040	No, Mr.
3296040	3298360	Ring seems to have just finished freeing it.
3298360	3302600	I'm going to use my resourcefulness, so I'm going to take 10 points.
3302600	3308600	And I have a gun on me and I'm going to shoot this thing because it scares me.
3309640	3311160	So, yeah, I mean, Mr.
3311160	3316440	Ring, you can see that Checkers, your old master, is that right?
3316440	3318040	Or is he still your current master?
3318040	3322280	I mean, does he still have anything to teach you compared to the wonders you've just seen
3322280	3323800	inside this creature's mind?
3323800	3324440	Good point.
3324440	3329400	I have been completely transformed by the darkness that is now within me.
3329960	3336840	It has completely tainted my soul, and I will now be known as Dark Soul.
3347240	3348440	Oh, my God.
3350440	3350760	Wow.
3352760	3353960	I love it so much.
3355080	3357000	Oh, my God.
3360600	3363320	Then, yeah, Mr.
3363320	3374760	Soul can see Checkers pulling out this gun as this divine creature is beginning to rise
3374760	3375480	up in the air.
3376360	3377720	What's everyone doing?
3378040	3380760	Checkers is just going to unload his gun.
3380760	3389160	And while he's screaming like, Elden, Elden, my name is no longer chosen to be Elden Ring.
3390360	3392680	You were once my friend and my mentor.
3398360	3402280	So you're just firing wildly into this thing as fast as the gun will shoot.
3402840	3403240	Exactly.
3403240	3405160	Yeah, it's going to be point blank range.
3405160	3409480	So this will be three normal firearm handguns rolls.
3410040	3418040	FAIL 85 on a 50, 36 on a 50, 19 on a 50.
3418040	3422920	Don't bother rolling damage on this because guns aren't very effective.
3424520	3434360	So, yeah, I mean, the bullets whack into it and I mean, they make holes and the thing
3434360	3436040	seems angry.
3436040	3444280	You can hear the timbre of its buzzing getting louder and the buzzing voice just fills
3444280	3450120	the room, even over the deafening effect of the gunshots.
3450120	3451560	And Mr.
3451560	3455560	Soul can hear it just saying, Destroy him.
3457960	3461320	Well, obviously, after some time to get...
3461320	3463560	Taking attacks, taking attacks, taking attacks!
3464920	3473080	As I finish unloading or like just shooting three bullets off at this thing, I feel the
3473080	3475880	same feeling that I got downstairs in the ballroom.
3475880	3477400	The feeling that broke your heart.
3479000	3479640	60.
3479640	3480360	44.
3480360	3480840	Fuck you.
3483720	3488520	I see the lack of effect that my bullets have made on this thing.
3489480	3495240	And I look at Eldin and I change the aim of my gun because I can feel him attacking me
3495240	3496760	again psychically.
3497560	3501160	And I fire a single bullet towards Eldin.
3502120	3502600	Wow.
3502600	3508920	OK, while you're doing this, the creature is just flying through the air past you to
3508920	3509960	go up the stairs.
3509960	3510520	Oh, OK.
3510520	3511160	Not at me.
3512120	3515560	It's quite happy to leave you two downstairs to kill each other while it escapes.
3516440	3518120	Pretty good plan on its part.
3519080	3521240	It's not stupid.
3522680	3524280	We've got personal shit we're working out.
3527160	3529640	So you were going to shoot Mr.
3529640	3529960	Soul?
3530920	3533000	Hopefully not, but I'm going to shoot at him.
3533960	3536360	You'll get a bonus die as well because it's point blank range.
3536360	3537160	Oh, perfect.
3538840	3542920	Well, that's a 31 and also a 31 again.
3542920	3546680	So I successfully shoot him.
3549160	3551080	So what kind of gun is this?
3551080	3556040	Just like a small handgun, like a 38.
3556040	3557560	Yeah, like a 38 special.
3557560	3560120	OK, so roll a D10 damage.
3563320	3563800	10.
3567800	3571480	OK, so yeah, there is this searing pain.
3572840	3578200	Your friend, your confidant, your leader, the man who defined your life.
3578200	3581640	Defined your beliefs, defined your existence until a moment ago.
3581640	3582760	A man named Checkers.
3585640	3588120	A man named Checkers.
3588920	3591480	Yes, Checkers has betrayed you.
3592520	3594040	But only because you betrayed me.
3594840	3595480	That's fair enough.
3595480	3598440	I went from 21 to 11 hit points.
3598440	3601800	Oh yeah, I mean, does the physical pain hurt more,
3601800	3605720	or is it more the emotional pain of having been shot by your mentor?
3605720	3607560	Well, obviously physical pain can't.
3607560	3608440	Oh, I just got shot.
3608440	3609960	Yes, physical pain hurts more.
3611000	3615800	And as soon as I shoot him, I drop the gun and I'm like, why?
3617320	3619080	Why would you do that?
3619080	3621800	You've shot him in the abdomen.
3621800	3624440	If you're lucky, maybe not in the gut, in the stomach,
3624440	3628360	but there's blood welling out from between his fingers now.
3628360	3631000	I definitely am going to immediately try to first aid him.
3633240	3635320	Is Mr. Soul putting up with that?
3636040	3638520	You've just been shot and now he's trying to tend to your wound.
3640360	3640860	Why?
3641720	3644360	Why did you not join on the true side of...
3646440	3647400	You got tricked.
3648280	3649240	They got to you.
3649240	3651080	I thought you were stronger than that.
3651080	3654680	But we seek the universe and its power.
3654680	3657000	Well, on my way down, you don't know any of this,
3657000	3660680	but on my way down the ladder, I thought about just whatever you're into,
3661720	3662520	I was going to do.
3662520	3664840	But then you tried to mind attack me again.
3664840	3666200	You son of a bitch.
3666200	3672200	And then he starts pouring the hydrogen peroxide on his open wound on his stomach.
3672200	3677400	Oh, there is a fine line between first aid and torture.
3678920	3682120	Well, I'm trying to do a little column A, a little column B.
3683400	3684920	Do you want to give me a first aid roll?
3686040	3686540	Yes.
3687880	3690280	54 on a 50.
3691080	3691880	I have four luck.
3692520	3694840	Oh, I'll spend four luck to make that pass.
3694840	3695560	Okay.
3695560	3697400	Which puts me at eight.
3697400	3705080	So you can have a D4 hit points back as somehow having hydrogen peroxide
3705080	3707560	poured in a gunshot wound does you the world of good.
3707560	3708760	Well, yeah, it's that.
3708760	3713960	And then once it's kind of done fizzing up, I get some gauze and just put it in the hole.
3713960	3717240	It was like 70% hydrogen peroxide, so it dissolves the bullet.
3717240	3723400	Uh, I'm back up to 13 now.
3723400	3724920	Former master checkers.
3725960	3729000	What was that thing that you were talking to?
3729000	3738040	That it wanted to be free and it wants to, I didn't quite understand, but it's powerful.
3738040	3743160	He's just like jaw on the floor, like mouth open, like does not understand what in the
3743160	3747320	past 20 minutes what's happened to his friend.
3747320	3749400	Like he's just like shaking his head.
3749400	3750360	Like what the fuck?
3750360	3758200	I've seen things on the others tonight that are so powerful.
3759800	3761160	More than you can imagine.
3761160	3769880	And while Mr. Soul bears his soul to checkers, let's cut upstairs.
3770840	3776840	Harvey and Lafayette can hear this buzzing sound from down below.
3776840	3777960	Then there's gunshots.
3777960	3778920	They're shouting.
3778920	3786760	The buzzing sound is getting louder and louder as something comes bursting out of the wardrobe.
3786760	3789080	Something very much like the things you saw outside.
3789080	3791960	But this time you're now seeing it in bright light.
3791960	3801960	You can see the twisted insectile form, the strange pincers, the pulsating head, the strange
3801960	3805160	wounds all over it as it floats above the ground.
3806040	3808120	Do you want to give me sand rolls first of all?
3810680	3813720	Oh shit, I fail a 68 on a 60.
3813720	3815720	Can you, can you luck a sanity roll?
3815720	3816360	You cannot.
3817080	3817400	Okay.
3817400	3818760	Can you lick a sanity roll?
3819400	3821560	How many licks in the center of a sanity roll?
3822360	3823320	I believe I passed.
3823320	3825000	Let me get my sheet back up.
3825000	3825720	Oh nope.
3825720	3827000	93 on an 89.
3827000	3827320	I fail.
3828360	3828760	Okay.
3828760	3829880	So you both failed.
3829880	3832760	So Lafayette loses.
3832760	3839640	Oh, he only loses one point of sand and Harvey loses five points.
3839640	3840440	That's more like it.
3842040	3844120	Can I have an intelligence roll off Harvey, please?
3844680	3845480	Yes, you can.
3848440	3850360	That's a 44 on a 60.
3851000	3851480	Okay.
3851560	3853320	So you're having a bad madness as well.
3853320	3855400	So again, you get five points of Cthulhu Mythos.
3857480	3858440	What do you think of them?
3858440	3859240	Blind panic?
3859240	3860360	Does that sound about right?
3860360	3861320	Yeah, totally.
3861320	3866120	So yeah, I mean in your panic to get out of the room, you're pushing Lafayette out of
3866120	3866840	the way.
3866840	3872280	The two of you are just stumbling all over each other and this creature actually doesn't
3872280	3873800	seem to be paying you much attention.
3874920	3877640	It just flies out of the room at speed.
3878600	3884760	From beyond in the corridor and down the stairs, you can hear sounds.
3885480	3889800	I mean, you heard a few sounds before, glass breaking and stuff like that.
3890360	3892840	But now there are other sounds.
3892840	3900120	There are people screaming and there's strange sounds like electrical discharge and just
3900120	3904360	this buzzing, so much buzzing in the air, not just this thing that flew past you.
3904360	3910280	But it's just like suddenly the air is absolutely filled with buzzing.
3910280	3912280	Oh my God, it's a swarm.
3913400	3915000	And shall we leave the episode here?
3915880	3916380	Yes.
3918120	3920120	Yeah, holy shit.
3921320	3926840	So we're going to be able to clean it all up and have a good ending by the next episode.
3926840	3928760	Yeah, it should be a pretty clean ending.
3928760	3929260	Fine.
3930440	3935480	The light in that tower was actually like a bug zapper that we destroyed.
3937240	3940520	It wasn't a zapper, it was going to draw them in like moths.
3940520	3941720	Oh my God.
3941720	3943080	There would have been thousands more.
3944280	3945400	But they would have been over there.
3945400	3947720	Yeah, they would have been over there.
3950360	3951480	It's totally what it is.
3953560	3955160	It's going to change the world, you know?
3958840	3966280	A body could be hollow before its blood ran cold
3969960	3980760	I didn't know that the wind could sew the tissue and faggot bone
3980760	3988760	You were hollow when you spoke to me
3991640	3995240	Hollow when you sang
3998600	4003400	I thought you might be starving
4004040	4012040	So I gave you everything
4016040	4020040	Thorns and rocks and devils glow
4020040	4024040	Brides and dry-baked clay
4024040	4030040	Crocus blossoms in February
4030680	4033560	And I lay home in May
4035640	4040040	Time between a mother's fingers
4040040	4043160	And spit off of a bridge
4045320	4048600	Restless legs at 3pm
4049800	4052680	While waiting for a fix
4090040	4099160	So come back here and see what's left of me
4103800	4109160	Is this the wholesome girl you left in Missouri?
4113080	4115880	My voice is nothing now
4115880	4120920	But the howl of the wind
4122760	4126440	Come closer dear in my teeth
4126440	4128920	Rattle in my jaw
4132520	4137480	Come closer dear in my teeth
4140120	4142920	Rattle in my jaw
