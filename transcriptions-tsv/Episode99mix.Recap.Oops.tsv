0	3160	Slap a can of beans and throw it at your mama.
3160	6280	It's Wolf the Dog here to give you bad advice
6280	9400	regarding your parental figures.
9400	11200	And I'm coming at you dead.
11200	16200	From 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station
16840	20640	that utilizes a bean-based biofuel
20640	25520	to make the electricity absolutely electric, my babies.
25520	29200	We also use coal, apparently.
29200	30600	People still use coal?
30600	32120	That shit is nasty.
32120	34680	What is not nasty is that this edition
34680	37040	of Howlin' with Wolf is from Jack.
37040	41160	Jack tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod,
41160	44720	which is one of the greatest feats a tweet can achieve.
44720	48720	They write, my dearest wolf, in times like this,
48720	51380	it is such a comfort to listen to your news
51380	56040	from contention, murderous ooze, orphan experiments,
56040	59920	inscrutable aliens, blood magic feds,
59920	62800	spine-rippin' robot balls,
62800	66760	the unspeakable whore come to eat the world.
66760	70680	These terrors keep the even larger daily ones at bay
70680	74160	for an hour or so, and for that, I am grateful.
74160	76180	Even when the world's a dumpster fire,
76180	79360	you still find us all the scrumptious,
79360	82220	unscorched, slop to slurp.
82220	86260	Love to my contention folks, Jack.
86260	88340	Hey there, Jack.
88340	90740	I always love when a fan of mine
90740	93460	talks about slurpin' that slop.
93460	97540	It makes my orifices tingle with anticipation.
97540	102540	My pores ooze with, ooze.
102540	104180	If you want me to read your words
104180	106420	on a segment similar to this one,
106420	110140	similar because it would be on this exact same segment,
110140	112700	go on and tag at Pretendin' Pod
112700	115860	or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts
115860	117300	and report that review
117300	121500	to your Wolfie at pretendinpod at gmail.com.
121500	124220	I promise I definitely read all of them
124220	126900	and it's not forced on my producer.
126900	129800	I'm fuckin' hungry, y'all.
129800	132120	And speaking of the rich,
132120	135140	we're rich with theme songs in this final recap
135140	137580	of season one of Pretending to be People
137580	140740	here at 694.2 PTBB,
140740	144540	Contingent's newest and only radio station.
144540	147720	But all arouse the menage a trois with a banger.
147720	148560	Banger?
148560	149660	Barely knew her.
149660	152580	It's Dream Girl with Pretty Sexual.
155580	156420	Mmm.
156420	159000	["Pretty People"]
170080	172340	Don't make me pretty, baby.
177260	179260	This is real love dream.
182940	185440	I knew I'd make you be pretty.
186420	189100	I knew I'd make you be pretty.
194100	195580	The tops of trees,
195580	199620	thick enough to obscure any view of what was below,
199620	201580	covered in a layer of kudzu,
201580	204720	seemed to go on endlessly.
204720	207820	Up and down, over hills and valleys,
207820	209580	mountains and gorges,
209580	213900	there was nothing but dense, verdant forest.
213900	216500	A circular, calm lake found itself
216500	219720	somewhere in the midst of this lush wilderness
219720	222220	and in the middle of that lake,
222220	225420	a small island with less than a quarter mile
225420	227100	from shore to shore.
227100	230580	A long wooden dock on the north side of the island
230580	233580	led to a charming two-story boathouse
233580	235860	with six well-kept cedar canoes
235860	239500	tied up below the second-story apartment.
239500	241820	If the island was the face of a clock,
241820	244240	that dock was at high noon.
244240	247360	There were six cute, cozy little cottages
247360	250460	evenly dispersed along the shore of the island
250460	253380	at one o'clock, three o'clock, five o'clock,
253380	256800	seven o'clock, nine o'clock, and 11 o'clock.
256800	260660	Five of the six cottages were in pristine condition.
260660	263060	The 11 o'clock place might have been two,
263060	265640	but it was impossible to tell from the outside
265640	268500	since the entire building was covered
268500	271060	by a massive blue tarp.
271100	273220	Truly master craft landscaping
273220	275800	surrounded each of these cottages.
275800	279860	Stunningly gorgeous flowers in every shade and shape
279860	282580	filled varied gardens and planters
282580	285260	that somehow both overran the terrain
285260	287940	and complemented it perfectly.
287940	290660	Each cottage had a cobblestone walkway
290660	293740	lined on either side by these lovely flower beds
293740	295940	and the walkways all made their way
295940	297980	to the center of the island
297980	300460	where a large, equally cute and cozy
300460	302980	hexagonal building sat.
302980	304700	There was a small welcome sign
304700	307620	on the south side of this building right at six o'clock
307620	312620	and it read, welcome to calm, comfy campground.
314060	316500	The circle of knowledge used this land
316500	318500	isolated by both geography
318500	320840	and some sort of unnatural perimeter
320840	324060	to execute a brainchild of Jim Cook
324060	327180	called Operation Hole Puncher.
327220	329740	This operation utilized the potent pheromone
329740	332980	from their newly developed experimental family of flowers
332980	335380	named Sanferra Blom.
335380	337780	This pheromone made the uninoculated
337780	339980	unnaturally suggestible.
339980	343680	The targets of this mission were so malleable
343680	346700	entire backstories could be prescribed
346700	349860	in order to extract specific information.
349860	352200	Roger Fairfield, an archeologist
352200	355140	with access to a new excavation site
355140	357820	designated The Nameless City,
357820	362460	was made to believe he was married to a woman named Angela,
362460	365460	actually played by Anne Love.
365460	369940	Alan Grimes, a child trafficker with government contracts,
369940	373020	was convinced a boy from one of his warehouses
373020	376860	was an artificial intelligence.
376860	380740	Each mark had something the circle of knowledge wanted.
380740	383320	Charles Digby had enough compromising evidence
383360	386400	to blackmail every important person in the city.
386400	390280	Martin Cupertino was in the midst of creating Cube,
390280	393520	the future of personal technology.
393520	395480	Pliable guests were duped
395480	398420	into signing extensive contracts.
398420	401140	The aim of Operation Hole Puncher
401140	406140	was to acquire as much information and access as possible,
406200	409040	but the system didn't always work smoothly.
409040	412520	Groups would sometimes trigger reality for each other.
412520	414640	They would need to be reset.
414640	417800	With Fairfield, the Grimes, Digby, and Cupertino,
417800	421160	even the fifth reset didn't quite stick,
421160	425100	and Cupertino somehow escaped before the sixth reset.
425100	427380	He was an anomaly.
427380	428960	And of course, there were some folks
428960	430680	who refused to share their secrets
430680	432700	regardless of their altered state.
432700	435960	A completely random example would be
435960	437720	Eunice and Jerry Bishop,
437720	440120	who at the time possessed a rare
440120	443200	and specifically sought-after book.
443200	447240	No matter what Jim Cook, Leon Simpson, or Ann Love tried,
447240	450240	friendship, torture, worse,
450240	453480	the bishops never surrendered their knowledge
453480	456600	of where the book was hidden.
456600	458160	This is the kind of environment
458160	460880	in which young Maggie Cook was raised.
460880	464000	She quickly found her life much more interesting
464000	466760	when the victim suspected or saw reality
466760	469560	through their flower-induced haze.
469560	472080	So she began to play her own games
472080	473840	with the temporary tenants.
473840	475520	It started innocently enough
475520	478480	she would talk to Circle of Knowledge members
478480	480680	when they were undercover with a mark.
480680	483940	Then she planted walkie-talkies in the cottages
483940	485840	to taunt the visitors.
485840	488120	But little Maggie eventually took it upon herself
488120	492400	to actually inoculate guests while they slept.
492400	493760	She was bored.
493760	498280	And some kids just like to watch the chaos they've created.
498280	500320	She watched from the roof of a cottage
500320	502520	the night she first saw the thing
502520	506120	that lived in the brackish waters of Lake Calm.
506120	508520	The six of them paddled the three canoes
508520	511000	like their lives depended on it.
511000	512560	Jack Russell always says,
512560	514440	"'To do a canoe.'"
514440	517560	She wondered if it was the last thing he said.
517560	520880	An unspeakable worm-like abomination
520880	524140	erupted above the surface of the water.
524140	528040	The thing rose 10 feet out of the ichor.
528640	531680	It was tube-like, covered in a squamous,
531680	534880	black, partially translucent membrane.
534880	536840	Its body was segmented,
536840	541000	and toxically green, pulsating arteries and veins
541000	544760	were visible through its thin-looking exterior.
544760	548080	It had no identifiable eyes or nose,
548080	551280	and its cavernous, circular mouths,
551280	553640	one sat just inside the other,
553640	556080	were lined with hooked teeth,
556080	557820	and it spit out a saliva
557820	561200	that was somehow darker than black.
561200	564660	From its maw, a sharp stylet protruded,
564660	568960	like something between a tongue and a noodle-like needle.
568960	573680	It plunged down, attached to the top of Jack Russell's head,
573680	578060	and ripped him up and out of the back of the canoe.
578060	580800	The thing sucked the short, portly man
580800	583680	into its round, teeth-encircled mouth
583680	587000	before it slipped quickly and quietly
587000	592000	back into the pitch-black water of Lake Calm.
593920	595640	She half-expected Jack Russell
595640	598560	to be standing at six o'clock the next day
598560	601740	with that dumb, blank expression on his face
601740	604800	like all the others would after a reset.
604800	606880	She liked watching their faces change.
606880	609560	It was impossible to tell, even for her,
609560	613580	if it was their last time being greeted by that sign.
614420	617460	Welcome to Calm, Comfy Campground.
617460	628580	Hip-hop music
647460	654740	John Lee Pettymore IV, Clark Bishop, and Keith Vigna felt eyes on them, all over them,
654740	659660	outside of their own bodies, floating in this vast nothingness.
659660	665740	They saw Keith Vigna open a door until D.B. Mitchell was there on the other side, curled
665740	672120	up in the fetal position, and her body began deteriorating hastily, like she had leprosy
672120	673120	in time-lapse.
673120	677560	However, she grew larger with each passing moment.
677560	682920	Clark Bishop handed an old piece of parchment to a young boy with a balloon-shaped head,
682920	686280	an eye so dark that the irises looked black.
686280	690880	And immediately, the boy's feet caught fire, and the fire grew and grew to consume the
690880	696100	young black-eyed boy in three voices, cried out in pain.
696100	702480	John Lee Pettymore IV crouched down, stared at a television, a blank white screen.
702480	706760	He reached out and touched the screen like Vanna White, but instead of a letter popping
706760	712800	up, Clark Bishop's parents, Eunice and Jerry, the size of action figures, jumped out of
712800	719100	the screen and ran up John Lee Pettymore IV's arm, climbed his shoulder, and flinged their
719100	722400	tiny selves into John's head.
722400	726780	It looked like the Bishops were going to disappear right into Pettymore's brain, but they both
726780	729640	got stuck halfway in.
729800	735440	Their legs writhed about and flailed in this never-ending dreamscape.
735440	742360	Oily, viscous sludge began dripping, and then sprayed out of John Lee Pettymore IV's head
742360	747840	where the Bishops had lodged themselves, and the ooze began collecting on a ground below,
747840	749440	then made of light.
749440	755180	And the ooze dripped, dripped, dripped, and then poured, until a laminar flow connected
755220	761460	the head of John Lee Pettymore IV to a pool of this inky substance that began shaping
761460	764060	itself into a large saucer.
764060	770820	But as the pool grew, the walls began rising outward, creating an imposingly colossal bowl,
770820	776300	and our view was forced to back up leagues as this shape continued to form, a mirror
776300	778220	of what was then below.
778220	783580	The miniscule body of John Lee Pettymore in the far distance continued to fill this thing's
783580	794360	final form, an incomprehensibly massive sphere, and it continued to grow, and grow, and then...
794360	800260	The three contention boys woke up in the mausoleum for the third time, in shock, cursed with
800260	805100	the memories of their recent trip to City State University.
805100	810300	Their stomachs were strangely full, their ears rang, and their eyes adjusted to the
810300	812820	dark, cold tomb.
812820	817060	A turned over coffin sat next to a pool of blood on the ground.
817060	822820	John Lee Kevinmore the 3rd in black tactical gear, Keith Vigna in his bright polo and boat
822820	829040	shoes, and Clark Bishop in an old contention PD uniform, all felt the searing pain where
829040	832560	names had been burned into their skin.
832560	836060	Marvin on each chest was still crossed out.
836060	841020	Maggie on the sole of each left foot was now crossed out as well.
841020	846700	The other two names on their backs and inside their dominant hands read respectively Drew
846700	847700	and Tildy.
847700	850900	It was 3pm on December 6th.
850900	856300	Two hours had passed since their last experience waking up next to Ari Manstein's corpse.
856300	861380	They walked out into the light past the three downed androids near the crawfish boil and
861380	867900	decided to return to contention, determined to cross Drew off their list.
867900	874700	As they departed from the funeral setting, the massive, gaunt creature reappeared, screaming,
874700	875980	and they took off running.
875980	879260	At the entrance, they ran into the old woman in the wheelchair.
879260	885580	With massive, deranged eyes, she sobbed at the sight of the repeating men.
885580	889620	John Lee Kevinmore pushed her wheelchair toward the parking lot.
889620	896100	The creature had no hair, big red pupils, eye slits that opened from the bottom, and
896100	902740	it wore a familiar black suit, cried out into the sky as it pursued the group from
902740	905900	behind.
905900	910300	John gave the old woman his gun as they approached the empty parking lot.
910300	917700	Empty that was, until a red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse drifted across the lot toward them,
917700	925380	and all could see behind the wheel sat Drew Andrews, the Baby Drewver.
925380	931820	Behind them, the creature spoke, and it somehow forced everyone to freeze in place.
931820	935780	Their bodies locked, and they turned to face the creature.
935780	939620	It didn't speak aloud, but they heard it inside their heads.
939620	942580	It apologized and spoke of a glitch.
942580	946180	There could not be two Clark Bishops.
946180	951740	The creature addressed each former officer by name and revealed Keith's full name,
951740	953540	Ashley Keith Beans.
953540	957260	He became flustered and pulled his gun, but he couldn't fire.
957260	963380	Clark's face turned red with rage, unable to move, and Kevinmore twitched helplessly.
963380	969620	The creature thought inside their heads, implored them not to be afraid, and a calming wave
969620	972420	overtook each upset man.
972420	982020	The old woman, finally at peace, closed her eyes and exhaled for the last time.
982020	987540	Drew whipped the car around, saw the creature, and screeched to a stop a few feet away.
987540	990380	The creature repeated itself in their minds.
990380	996140	It sought information on the Clark glitch, and was willing to trade knowledge.
996140	1005340	It introduced itself as 43629 DC FBI, and it confirmed it was alien, better than human,
1005340	1006820	from Myriad.
1006820	1012700	Keith pulled out the ring they retrieved from Jim Cook's house and claimed to be Jim trapped
1012700	1014500	in Keith's body.
1014500	1019100	The creature from Myriad was ecstatic to hear this news, and was quick to communicate something
1019100	1023220	in its strange manner to seemingly no one in sight.
1023220	1027260	When Clark asked how Jim and the creature knew each other, it confirmed they worked
1027260	1029580	together at Myriad.
1029580	1036300	John convinced 43629 to reveal more information about its discreet co-worker so they could
1036340	1038940	do something nice for him on his birthday.
1038940	1040620	The creature obliged.
1040620	1049020	Jim's birthday was on December 1st, and he always visited Prairie Pie in the city.
1049020	1055420	The creature asked if Jim was in Keith's body to repair the relationship between Myriad
1055420	1060740	and just James in regards to Operation San Ferra Blum.
1060740	1061860	He said yes.
1062020	1067140	Clark told the creature what they knew about Clark Old, and the alien reached out its long
1067140	1071540	arm toward the group to wipe their memories of this conversation.
1071540	1078620	It didn't work, but believing it had, 43629 just turned and left.
1078620	1084300	As Drew pulled around in front of the group, he leaned out the window, a bit too cool for
1084300	1085300	Drew.
1085300	1090180	Hello, contention police officers, please get in the car and come with me.
1090180	1093820	The gang, excited to see Drew, hopped in and took off.
1093820	1099100	Drew let them know he'd been unable to receive any calls or texts due to having gotten wet,
1099100	1100940	which destroyed his phone.
1100940	1106180	The contention boys explained John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirst's whole situation, that they've
1106180	1113140	killed or soon will kill Marvin Glass, and that Keith killed the Duke, which was actually
1113140	1116140	Keith's brother, Ferguson Beans.
1116140	1119140	Drew ran down the current state of contention.
1119180	1124940	Pastor Adam Cain, aka Daddy, took control of the town.
1124940	1130380	The First Creek Family of Contingent created a network of puddles for the survivors to
1130380	1138180	hop into if they saw the residue, which only animals, kids, and insane people can see.
1138180	1145280	They captured the ooze using fish, and Daddy Pastor Cain collected it in a central location.
1145280	1151200	They hatched a plan to grab the watch from Keith's room at Hotel Motel, but after extensive
1151200	1156440	questioning, the boys smelled something fishy in Drew's attitude and speech.
1156440	1161160	John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirst's eyes rolled into the back of his head, and he thought
1161160	1166840	real hard about whether or not they should trust Drew.
1166840	1174440	Deep in the void of John's memories, where they reached out and met the collective unconscious,
1174800	1180360	John saw a reflection of his father, John Lee Pettymore the Third, in a blank television
1180360	1186400	screen, but he was much younger than the body John currently inhabited back in reality.
1186400	1192280	The TV turned on, and the screen showed the contention police station as it was last seen,
1192280	1195680	an absolute wreck with water pooled everywhere.
1195680	1196920	The channel changed.
1196920	1203020	Jim Cook briefed three people, and John recognized the faces from the file in Marvin Glass's
1203020	1208700	compound labeled K-Cel, Kyle, Karen, and Kevin.
1208700	1216860	Kyle, the unknown who died at Kevin's forced hand, Karen, also known as Ann Love, the woman
1216860	1224540	who killed Clark Bishop's parents, and Kevin, John's daddy, John Lee Pettymore the Third.
1224540	1231620	On the television screen, Jim called Karen over to speak privately, and the channel changed.
1231620	1236120	Back in the mess of a police department, Drew leaned on a plastic service cart and
1236120	1238560	headed to the evidence locker.
1238560	1246020	He loaded up the radio, the helmet, and a briefcase that contained $5 million, his cut
1246020	1248280	from the deal with the Duke.
1248280	1249980	The channel changed again.
1249980	1257560	Drew pushed the loaded cart up through the now emptied sanctuary of the First Church
1257560	1258980	of Contention.
1258980	1260940	The TV turned off with a click.
1260940	1265940	The charcoal glass of the screen rolled down like a car window as Karen screamed,
1265940	1271580	WHERE IS IT?
1271580	1277920	Clark's parents, Eustace and Jerry Bishop, at gunpoint, refused to tell Ann Love what
1277920	1279700	she wanted to know.
1279700	1285500	Behind the lowered screen of the television sat a book made of strange, uncured leather
1285500	1289900	with hair and maybe a few freckles.
1289900	1290900	John blinked.
1290900	1294740	The television screen suddenly looked completely normal again.
1294740	1297620	He stared at his father's reflection.
1297620	1302000	Karen laughed maniacally as she shoved the gun into Jerry's mouth.
1302000	1304740	She forced Eustace to watch.
1304740	1310340	John felt a decision being made inside himself.
1310340	1312780	Kevin turned to Karen.
1312780	1314580	THE BOOK ISN'T HERE!
1314580	1322820	Karen's eyes lit up as she began chanting in an alien, ancient tongue, and Clark's parents
1322820	1329220	began to rise off the thick carpet on the floor of their living room.
1329220	1332380	John's vision again changed perspective completely.
1332380	1339860	A man's left hand was outstretched, a trickle of red flowed across the soft skin.
1339860	1348700	Suddenly Drew leaned in and kissed a ring on a finger that dripped with blood.
1348700	1355000	John came to in the car and asked Drew to pull over as convincingly as he could without
1355000	1360620	arousing suspicion, which amounted to pleading and saying he was about to shit his pants.
1360620	1366260	After some resistance, Drew pulled off down a quiet road next to an empty cornfield, and
1366260	1370620	as soon as the car stopped, John pulled out his gun and aimed it at Drew.
1370620	1374980	John demanded the keys, and Clark put him in handcuffs.
1374980	1377920	John explained his vision as they gave him a pat down.
1377920	1383700	Drew confessed he was tortured and forced to give the items to the church.
1383700	1388980	In their search, they discovered a small, cheap piece of carpet in Drew's pocket.
1388980	1395580	Apparently, he would intentionally choke himself with it in order to see things he shouldn't
1395580	1397060	be able to.
1397060	1403020	Apparently, that's how he was able to find the boys at the city cemetery.
1403020	1408380	Keith shoved the carpet in Drew's mouth and said, Tildy B. Mitchell.
1408380	1410640	Drew choked for a few minutes.
1410640	1416620	When he caught his breath, he told them she was still alive, but she was trapped somewhere
1416620	1419740	she can't escape.
1419740	1425780	In the distance, Drew noticed a black lab bounding up to them, and with reckless joy,
1425780	1428100	he screamed out, Tyler!
1428100	1434300	Well, Tyler, a black lab that belonged to Councilwoman Carrie Pages, had gone missing
1434300	1440140	on December 2nd, and Drew's face brimmed with affection as he gushed that Tyler was the
1440140	1445340	bestest dog that had ever existed, and he was afraid Tyler had been eaten by homeless
1445340	1446840	people.
1446840	1448800	Clark noticed the slip-up.
1448800	1454920	Drew repeated verbatim what Councilwoman Carrie Pages had said several days before.
1454920	1461000	Keith tricked Drew into admitting she was, in fact, Carrie Pages.
1461000	1467480	Exposed, Drew Carrie spilled the details about how they switched bodies at the church with
1467480	1471800	the radio under Daddy Kane's direction.
1471800	1475060	The contingent boys struck a deal with Drew Carrie.
1475060	1477440	She would be a double agent for them.
1477440	1481480	They threw the handcuff Drew Carrie into the trunk and took off.
1481480	1485160	Tyler the black lab sat comfortably in the passenger seat.
1485160	1486160	Their destination?
1486160	1488020	Hotel Motel.
1488020	1489020	Their goal?
1489020	1494080	Acquire the watch in Keith's room safe that he took off his dead brother's wrist, the
1494080	1500600	same watch their father, William Beanes, had given Ferguson so many years before.
1500600	1506040	As they approached contention, they reached a blockade made of church pews with a sign
1506040	1510920	that pointed off to the side and indicated the path of a detour.
1510920	1517120	The group pulled over, continued on foot, and left Drew Carrie in the trunk.
1517120	1520960	Uncereptitiously, the boys traveled along the highway.
1520960	1528220	In the distant skyline, a massive wall of water surrounded the property of the First
1528220	1530600	Church of Contention.
1530600	1532640	Clark stared.
1532640	1539040	He couldn't contain his obsession with the fish flopping around inside this enormous
1539040	1541680	unnatural water wall.
1541680	1544800	At Hotel Motel, all of the doors were open.
1544800	1550640	A dunking booth sat in the middle of the parking lot, and a young, larger boy with round cheeks
1550640	1555160	sat precariously atop the trapdoor-style chair.
1555160	1560000	He stuffed his face with cheesy ziti and surveyed the area.
1560000	1564960	This omnomny lookout was easily fooled by Keith's quick disguise.
1564960	1567720	Mud spread across his face like a beard.
1567720	1573360	The inside of Keith's room at Hotel Motel was ransacked, but luckily his safe and the
1573360	1576040	watch inside it had remained hidden.
1576040	1580680	He stuffed the watch in his pocket and left, but when Keith rejoined the group, he handed
1580680	1584140	the watch to John, who promptly put it on.
1584140	1591660	As the watch slid on, John's consciousness phased out of reality, like a TV changed channels.
1591660	1597380	He found himself in contention, as it was in the 1880-somethings.
1597380	1605660	All the wet grass suddenly dried, the dirt turned to dust, and he saw a man face down,
1605660	1607280	unmoving.
1607280	1611760	Suddenly he saw a mostly buried metal door with an inscription that read,
1611760	1614440	Pettymore Forevermore.
1614440	1616120	The watch slid off.
1616120	1620640	John shared his experience with the others and slapped the watch on Clark, who saw the
1620640	1626620	same foreboding vision, but instead of John's door, Clark saw Chief Maggie Cook's house
1626620	1632120	floating in the air, his door buried within, and the inscription read,
1632120	1639680	1522518195518, the numbers for The Overseer.
1639860	1645620	Another watch swap, Keith saw the same scene in the Old West, just outside the new town
1645620	1647140	of contention.
1647140	1650840	He saw a man face down in the dust, unmoving.
1650840	1656460	He saw his hands tremble, and he rolled the body over, the man was dead.
1656460	1662980	A tri-folded piece of parchment fell out of the man's pocket, it was a job advertisement
1662980	1673540	that read, we is hiring able bodies, readying untapped sight, plenty of work, hesitate not.
1673540	1678880	The watch slid off Keith's arm and he let out a small scream.
1678880	1683260	Clark tripped over the edge of sanity and pinned Keith to the ground.
1683260	1687740	He ripped off the watch and threw it away, but John grabbed it and slapped it back on
1687740	1689720	his own wrist.
1689720	1695340	The watch traded hands several more times back and forth before they found out that
1695340	1700400	by joining hands, they could all share the foreboding sights.
1700400	1706700	They saw Tildy B. Mitchell walk slowly backwards into Bean's pond, steadily, until the water
1706700	1711540	rose above her head and she disappeared from sight.
1711540	1717280	The channel changed, they sat in a tavern, their own face reflected in the mirror behind
1717280	1723240	the bar, but they wore the thick hand-stitched clothes of the dead man from out on that old
1723240	1725060	dusty road.
1725060	1729960	The barmaid refilled their glass and attempted some friendly small talk, so you're the new
1729960	1734080	miner in town, who rode ahead looking for a room?
1734080	1741240	Three men, each in their own vision, affirmed her query with a nod, well, welcome to contention,
1741240	1743400	Silas Cole.
1743400	1747720	Another channel change, a hooded figure lurked in the shadows.
1747720	1753740	Suddenly, light flooded in and illuminated a decrepit and haggard Clark Bishop.
1753740	1760600	Inside this tomb, he read a strange book made from uncured leather.
1760600	1768200	Blood dripped from the spine, a tall, gaunt creature entered and croaked out in its unnatural
1768200	1769200	speech.
1769200	1785760	The two figures charged each other and a blinding light cleansed the interior of the tomb.
1785760	1791400	Just then, the three contention officers entered the empty mausoleum.
1791400	1797760	They carried the casket of Ari Manstein, they sat it down gently and closed the door behind
1797760	1799820	them as they left.
1799820	1803280	After a bright flash of light, the scene changed.
1803280	1809120	Three individuals, two humans and one towering translucent creature in a black suit, stood
1809120	1811840	in an old abandoned warehouse.
1811840	1817440	Moonlight streamed in from the cracks and holes in the roof and reflected in puddles
1817440	1820240	of stagnant water on the ground.
1820240	1827120	The creature from Myriad handed a manila envelope to the two humans, a man and a woman.
1827120	1831080	Inside, there was a drawing on a small piece of paper.
1831080	1835200	It was a circle encircled by six circles.
1835200	1841640	Another bright flash of light, James the mill worker dragged these two now lifeless bodies.
1841640	1847040	From above, they saw the two corpses at the bottom of a man-made pit and then there was
1847040	1852560	a time lapse of the bodies as they bloated and changed color.
1852640	1855320	A real Clark Bishop fell into the pit.
1855320	1859320	A final flash of light revealed Chief Maggie Cook.
1859320	1866680	She gave orders to a looming overweight man in an all-black combat uniform.
1866680	1870440	He had a large scar over his right eye.
1870440	1878600	Charged with his mission, the android created by Myriad headed off to James the mill worker's
1878600	1879880	house.
1879880	1884880	After the visions from William Beanes' watch, they returned to the real world and stepped
1884880	1886280	back from each other.
1886280	1891160	Clark saw the black ooze pouring out of John Lee Kevinmore the third.
1891160	1896400	It dripped from his eyes, ears, and mouth all the way down to his hands.
1896400	1902640	It was on Clark and Keith's too and a string of ooze bridged all six of their hands, drizzled
1902640	1906120	down and collected on the ground.
1906120	1909680	It moved toward Clark but he blinked and it was gone.
1909680	1913800	A truck nearby idled and a man's voice hollered,
1913800	1916960	All right, come on out of there, Randy.
1916960	1921320	We can do this the easy way or you can disappear.
1921320	1923640	How much worse can you possibly get?
1923640	1928840	You don't want to give daddy a shot, he can go back and fix everything back to normal.
1928840	1931680	We need more bodies, Randy.
1931680	1938780	Keith recognized the voice of Terrence Elizabeth Licker from Lickers Lickers as he shouted
1938780	1940660	at Randy Angst.
1940660	1947220	Keith Vigna angry relayed that Licker had shorted him three dollars and shook up his
1947220	1948300	beer.
1948300	1953460	They headed toward the voice, guns out with Vigna in front.
1953460	1957720	Keith made his way to the side of the house and peeked at the idle truck.
1957720	1963520	The truck bed layered with tarps was filled with water and fish as well as Jimmy Sanders,
1963520	1969020	the manager of Subtropolis and John Lee Pettymore's cousin, who called in the oil spill several
1969020	1970220	days earlier.
1970220	1977580	His eyes were wide and wild and he muttered something about a number four with no tomato.
1977580	1980320	Keith ran for the keys of the truck and turned it off.
1980320	1984560	John popped out to get Jimmy's attention and the hippie's eyes widened.
1984560	1988460	Terrified at the sight of John, he dipped down into the water.
1988460	1994740	John looked into the living room and watched T. Licker and another man, Luca Fade Fudgevitz,
1994740	1998280	shove Randy Angst down onto the carpet.
1998280	2003440	When the truck shut off, the two men turned their attention outside.
2003440	2008520	Inside the truck, Keith opened the glove box and found a mag light and a folded up picture
2008520	2015080	of himself, Keith Vigna, with an inscription that read, Collect Alive.
2015080	2019780	John attempted to pull Jimmy Sanders out of the water, but Jimmy dove right back in.
2019780	2023680	Fade and Luca saw John and Keith as they exited the house.
2023680	2027900	Fade approached Keith, crowbar drawn, and Luca reached into his back pocket.
2027900	2031860	Clark crept inside and told Randy Angst to find cover.
2031860	2038180	Keith drew his gun, pointed it at his own head, and threatened to fire if they moved.
2038180	2044660	John, with no grace whatsoever, shot Fade in the shoulder, yelled to drop their weapons,
2044660	2046980	and used the truck as cover.
2046980	2052360	Luca dropped the crowbar and left a trail of blood along the white paint as he slumped
2052360	2058040	back into the garage door and then down onto the driveway.
2058040	2061280	Terrence Licker pressed his gun against his own head.
2061280	2064620	Think you can play games with me?
2064620	2069440	Clark sprang from behind, grabbed the gun of T. Licker, and wrestled him to the ground.
2069440	2074580	Keith smashed Terrence in the mouth with his own mag light and sent teeth flying out into
2074580	2076580	Randy Angst's front yard.
2076580	2081620	John zip-tied Luca's hands together, and Clark retrieved the loose gun on the driveway.
2081620	2091580	Keith rolled Licker over, grabbed his wallet, removed three one-dollar bills, and smiled.
2091580	2097940	Beat and shaken, Terrence explained they gathered bodies for Daddy Pastor Kane to sacrifice
2097940	2100660	so he could go back in time to fix everything.
2100660	2104140	Daddy said Keith Vigna was especially important.
2104140	2111100	John shoved a piece of carpet from Drew Carey into Terrence's mouth and demanded, Daddy.
2111100	2115140	A few seconds of choking later, he coughed it up, looked at John Lee Kevin Moore the
2115140	2121300	3rd, and freaked out, you're one of them, it's in you.
2121300	2125220	John caught a brief reflection of himself in the rearview mirror.
2125220	2130180	Black ooze ran out of his eyes, nose, and ears.
2130220	2134620	He dove into the truck bed pool, the teeming puddle with Jimmy Sanders.
2134620	2138460	John felt the strangest sensation.
2138460	2144540	His head vibrated and heated up, and then a sudden feeling of comfort washed through
2144540	2147140	his cranial cavities.
2147140	2148460	He resurfaced.
2148460	2154780	There was an overpowering smell of rancid fish, and John vomited back in the water in
2154780	2156700	which he and Jimmy stood.
2156740	2163340	Jimmy looked over calmly, unafraid of John for the first time, and in the lull, Randy
2163340	2167900	stumbled out of his house, but something was off.
2167900	2172460	Randy didn't remember the encounter with the robot man at James the millworker's house,
2172460	2177820	but he did say Pastor Kane had been a real dick since he lost his family in that car
2177820	2179980	accident a few days ago.
2179980	2185500	Terrence blamed the crash on the three contentioned police officers, and Clark, Keith, and John
2185500	2192660	noticed Randy's cane was topped with a Rubik's cube instead of a tooth.
2192660	2197020	It was clear that this somehow wasn't the same Randy Angst.
2197020	2203460	Similar, sure, but their Angst was a dentist and a realtor, and the head of the contentioned
2203460	2206660	historical society, and a lover.
2206660	2211380	This Randy Angst was the director of the Children's Museum?
2211380	2216460	The trio, disassociated with their current reality, acted a bit rashly.
2216460	2221160	Clark barged into the house, knocked Randy to the ground, and screamed into his face
2221160	2224740	about who he was and who he was not.
2224740	2231900	Keith pulled his gun, fired wildly, and put a stray bullet directly through Fade's head.
2231900	2236820	Pushed further past the brink, he noticed the ooze that dripped down John's face.
2236820	2243180	Keith aimed the gun at John, and ordered him to get back in the water.
2243180	2248780	Clark smashed Angst's head into the linoleum floor, then realized what he was doing and
2248780	2252220	meekly apologized as he backed out of the house.
2252220	2258060	John resurfaced, momentarily rid of the ooze that consistently dripped from his orifices,
2258060	2261060	if one was in a certain frame of mind.
2261060	2264820	And off in the distance, they heard the rumble of vehicles.
2264820	2270320	The contention police posse piled into the truck and drove off, intent to grab their
2270320	2274540	original car, Drew Carey, and head to Bean's Pond.
2274540	2278500	John took the driver's seat, Keith called shotgun, and Clark jumped in the truck bed
2278500	2280700	to play with the fish.
2280700	2286180	Suddenly, two vehicles approached, one from either end of the street, a truck with a hot
2286180	2291860	tub in tow, and an Impala with a refrigerator on its side strapped to the top.
2291900	2298100	In the Impala, John could see Asher and Avery Little, the parents of the two children that
2298100	2302700	were absorbed by the goo in front of James the millworker's house.
2302700	2307700	John punched it into reverse, cut through a field, and the two cars attempted to tail.
2307700	2314180	One sweet handbrake 180 later, John hit the road unaccompanied, foot all the way down
2314180	2315860	on the gas.
2315860	2320940	They pulled along agent Trent Chad's red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse, where they left Drew
2320940	2325900	Carey, and Clark hopped out of the truck bed, sprinted to the trunk, and threw Drew
2325900	2331320	Carey and Tyler, the black lab, into the fish-filled tarp-tub truck bed.
2331320	2336500	The two vehicles in pursuit were able to catch up while the unlikely protagonists collected
2336500	2339480	their co-worker's body and their double agent's dog.
2339480	2346220	But a gruesome scream came from the Impala refrigerator as the Littles pulled up.
2346540	2347540	Glass shattered.
2347540	2352020	A body was snatched up and slammed into the side of the nearby truck.
2352020	2356220	That truck's driver climbed out the window and attempted to jump into the hot tub, but
2356220	2360580	something nabbed his foot and dangled him mid-air.
2360580	2365060	A blink revealed the thickest wave of ooze yet.
2365060	2370740	The driver, being slowly consumed by the inky substance, desperately grabbed onto the man
2370740	2375420	already in the hot tub, only to seal his fate as well.
2375420	2381180	The ooze ripped the two men up into the sky and slammed them down into the concrete below,
2381180	2387480	repeatedly leaving bright red smears across the cold ground.
2387480	2392060	With the whole group somehow intact, John Lee Kevinmore the 3rd peeled away.
2392060	2399260	In his rear-view mirror, John saw the incomprehensibly massive wave of ooze crashing forward slowly
2399260	2402740	but relentlessly toward their vehicle.
2402740	2404660	They soon reached a roadblock.
2404660	2410980	A crane, loaded heavily with construction tube pipes, intentionally blocked the highway.
2410980	2415060	John went to whip the truck around the obstruction, but a tire caught an edge.
2415060	2421260	The truck turned over, smashed into the ground, and all five occupants were thrown clear of
2421260	2422300	the vehicle.
2422300	2427220	The truck continued to roll, tumbled into a billboard for owls, tires, and tigers, and
2427220	2428720	exploded.
2428720	2435200	The discombobulated set of sitting ducks saw Gary Daley emerge from a storm drain.
2435200	2439360	He shrieked and hollered for them to join him in the sewers.
2439360	2445440	As they looked back, the officers saw a massive surge of ooze, bigger than any they had seen
2445440	2448600	before, and it steadily flowed toward them.
2448600	2454360	Clark picked up Drew's unconscious body and carried it toward Gary, who had popped his
2454360	2455920	head out of the storm drain.
2455960	2460920	A disoriented Keith got up from on top of Jimmy Sanders, and he and John helped him
2460920	2464080	toward the sewer with Tyler on their heels.
2464080	2469760	After they confirmed Gary's identity with a fact only he would know, the wrecked crew
2469760	2471920	dove down into the drain.
2471920	2477920	Gary, eyes covered by his hands, explained that the goo only chased you if you looked
2477920	2478920	at it.
2478920	2483760	Gary led the group through the tunnels while they discussed John's body swap situation.
2483760	2489360	Also, Gary was tripping a bit, apparently so he could see the goo when he needed to.
2489360	2494680	He was especially perturbed by the goo that dripped from John's orifices.
2494680	2498720	Gary expressed how much he'd been hoping to see them since the events of the last couple
2498720	2499720	days.
2499720	2504740	He described how the pastor put up a wall of water around his church, developed a strong
2504740	2510280	following in the town, got everyone to start calling him daddy, and said he would be able
2510280	2516800	to go back in time to fix everything as long as they got a hold of Keith Vigna.
2516800	2521800	Gary then pointed them toward a blog post from Harold Dorsey that had been wiped from
2521800	2523120	the internet.
2523120	2530520	The post was entitled Operation Samfara Blom and a Rogue Police Chief in Contention.
2530520	2537160	It described Dorsey's experiences in The Scrap Pit and The Den of Sin, as well as his new
2537160	2540120	investigation in Contention.
2540120	2547480	Maggie had been in touch to, quote, open people's eyes and talk to him about Samfara Blom, the
2547480	2553040	flowers in the city, Jim Cook, the Circle of Knowledge, Bar Corps, and the mill on the
2553040	2554920	other side of the city.
2554920	2559920	Maggie appeared spooked by the murder of her father and called off the arranged meeting,
2559920	2562280	so Harold was going to find her.
2562280	2564200	The boys confirmed this was all true.
2564200	2569120	Gary said he could get them wherever they needed to go through the tunnels, so they
2569120	2573200	set off for Maggie's house and Bean's Pond.
2573200	2578960	On the way, they entered an underground chamber where Gary Daley, Harry Klinker, and others
2578960	2581920	had set up a makeshift campsite.
2581920	2587040	As they approached, Mildred Mitchell ran into a tent away from a woman who was questioning
2587040	2588040	her.
2588040	2594040	Casey Kristoff, a janitor at the First Church of Contention, leaned against a column and
2594040	2595880	read a book.
2595880	2598600	Harry was relieved to see them all safe.
2598600	2602600	Gary introduced Clara Blankenship, a woman from the city.
2602600	2607800	She was here visiting friends whose cat had disappeared and who recently joined the First
2607800	2610760	Creek family of contention to find the kitty.
2610760	2615680	The FCFC collected all the animals in contention behind the fish wall.
2615680	2621980	They discussed Clara's tattoo, which portrayed a robed figure that carried a ball of light.
2621980	2627380	It was inspired by a crazy dream she'd had a couple years ago of this figure pulling
2627380	2631160	a ball of light out of a television.
2631160	2637020	Not really paying attention to the important conversation, Keith noticed that Casey seemed
2637020	2640680	to be listening in rather than reading his book.
2640680	2647700	Harry and Clark used smelling salts to rouse Drew Carey, who was over the moon to see Tyler
2647700	2648700	again.
2648700	2654820	She confirmed her assigned task was to bring the trio back to the FCFC so daddy could hold
2654820	2660400	them accountable for the death of his family and also use Keith to time travel.
2660400	2666860	The officers explained the body swap situation to the others in camp to everyone's astonishment.
2666860	2672400	Then they asked Gary about his experiences with magic, the spell he cast on them as children,
2672400	2673920	and the book they found.
2673920	2679560	They asked Gary what he did with his spell book and he began to weep.
2679560	2682960	He'd given it to Clark's parents.
2682960	2686780	He was scared that's why Eunice and Jerry were killed.
2686780	2692180	Gary's grandfather received the book from a figure that looked like the one on Clara's
2692180	2693800	tattoo.
2693800	2699540	John reported a similar figure had given him a note in binary that confessed he had killed
2699540	2702020	the chief's father, Jim Cook.
2702020	2707080	The figure also asked John to say hi to him for him.
2707080	2711020	Clark remembered an incident in the library when he was young.
2711020	2712920	Gary confirmed Clark's memory.
2712920	2717220	That figure from the tattoo had locked them in the library and was chased away by the
2717220	2719760	tall gaunt creatures in suits.
2719760	2725400	Claire then showed them a video from John Peters that had been scrubbed from the internet.
2725400	2731360	He spoke about a strange vision he had during his coma in which he was led to a parallel
2731360	2738440	dimension by a man with a black Nike bag who could burn folks with his hands.
2738440	2742580	Clara queried what a black Nike bag had to do with another world or a person who could
2742580	2745060	burn folks with his hands.
2745060	2751980	John explained his uncle, Don D. Pettymore, had the ability to burn things with his hands.
2751980	2757780	Don called it devil hands and it was mostly used as a party trick so John didn't think
2757780	2758780	much of it.
2758780	2763360	But when Clark asked Clara if she'd seen anyone with hot hands in their dreams of the
2763360	2766580	robed figure, it jogged John's mind.
2766580	2772480	The last time he'd seen his uncle, they were being pursued by those translucent gaunt
2772480	2775260	alien things in black suits.
2775260	2780560	John needed to know more so when Keith pulled out the watch he'd stolen from Ferguson,
2780560	2784120	John snatched the timepiece and slapped it on himself.
2784120	2789080	The channel on John's reality began to change as expected and then it stopped and he saw
2789080	2792140	the kitchen of his childhood home.
2792140	2797800	His daddy, John Lee Pettymore III, younger than John ever remembered seeing him, paced
2797800	2799880	back and forth anxiously.
2799880	2806800	His face turned hopeful as John's mother entered the room but she slowly shook her head no
2806800	2810640	and tears poured down her face.
2810640	2814040	Her husband rushed to embrace his shaking wife.
2814040	2819880	Her body convulsed rhythmically to the sobs as a negative pregnancy test fell from her
2819880	2823000	grasp onto the cold tile floor.
2823000	2824400	The channel changed.
2824400	2830860	John saw his daddy again, eyes completely wide and bloodshot, knuckles white as he gripped
2830860	2837460	the steering wheel of his black 1977 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am.
2837460	2843660	Backlit by a home completely engulfed in flames, he looked into the rearview mirror to make
2843660	2846220	sure he wasn't being followed.
2846220	2849860	He spoke into a large car phone.
2849860	2853380	The vector adopted by the Cain family has been eliminated.
2853380	2858280	Casualties unfortunately include the rest of the family.
2858280	2864840	A Fincher-esque aerial shot of this entire scene slowly zoomed in on the fire and a young
2864840	2869640	boy crawled out from this completely consumed building.
2869640	2875400	He had a balloon-shaped head and eyes so dark the irises looked black.
2875400	2879240	Back to John's black muscle car as he drove off into the night.
2879240	2883500	The camera did that cool thing where it moved through the license plate into the trunk and
2883500	2891360	there a baby swaddled in a black suit jacket laid on top of adoption papers.
2891360	2896180	Back in the contention sewer tunnels, the watch fell off John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth's
2896180	2897180	hand.
2897180	2904380	He slumped to the ground wide-eyed, dazed, and he repeated three words over and over
2904380	2907980	to himself.
2908480	2911140	The vector.
2911140	2917280	As John dry heaved, Keith confessed he'd seen tall gaunt things in black suits when he was
2917280	2918280	a kid.
2918280	2922840	They'd invaded his family's estate from the sky.
2922840	2929360	Alarms blared, he and Ferguson ran, security was able to take care of the translucent intruders.
2929360	2934280	That night Keith watched their father give Ferguson the watch.
2934420	2938540	William said Ferguson was going to be, quote, the savior.
2938540	2942700	And when the time came, the watch would fit.
2942700	2948660	Now that Ferguson was dead, Keith wondered if maybe he was the savior.
2948660	2951620	After all, the watch did fit him.
2951620	2955820	He proved it, and reality changed channels like before.
2955820	2959420	Suddenly Keith saw Bean's pond.
2959420	2963380	Three figures stepped over his vision toward the pond.
2963480	2968080	As Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, and John Lee Pettymore the Thirth approached the bank of
2968080	2973000	Bean's pond, John trailed the other two by a few yards.
2973000	2977200	Focused on searching for something in the water, Clark and Keith failed to see their
2977200	2979600	partner betray them.
2979600	2986320	John raised his gun, took a deep breath, and fired two shots, one for each of them.
2986320	2992560	He quickly finished the task with four more bullets, crouched down, and pulled the watch
2992560	2995420	off Keith's inert wrist.
2995420	3004300	John stood, slipped the watch over his bloody hand, and walked slowly into the frigid water
3004300	3008100	of Bean's pond.
3008100	3012420	Clark and John saw Keith's eyes readjust to their underground reality.
3012420	3019660	However, unlike the other times when one of them came out of a vision, the watch remained
3019660	3021180	on his wrist.
3021400	3025680	Keith and John's eyes met, and John saw a great fear.
3025680	3031920	All Keith could see was the black ooze that poured from every orifice on Pettymore's face.
3031920	3032920	He stammered.
3032920	3036400	He'd just seen them all die at the pond.
3036400	3041920	Keith turned back to the goo-covered face of his partner, John Lee Kevinmore, and weirdly
3041920	3046160	asked him to please hand over his gun.
3046160	3052020	John moved a hand to his holster, and everyone else in the room nervously sought cover.
3052020	3055840	Keith whispered what his vision revealed into Clark's ear.
3055840	3061220	The paranoia was growing, so the trio decided to share what they had seen in order to grow
3061220	3062220	some trust.
3062220	3067880	John said he'd seen confirmation that he was a child of destiny.
3067880	3073200	His daddy, Kevin Lee Pettymore, was sent to kill the Cain family.
3073200	3078420	He set fire to the house, but Adam managed to escape undetected.
3078420	3083600	More importantly to Kevin, the Cains had recently adopted a little baby.
3083600	3087280	Pettymore stole the baby, adoption papers and all.
3087280	3091060	That baby was John Lee Pettymore IV.
3091060	3094480	He was meant to be Adam Cain's brother.
3094480	3097480	But he was so much more than that.
3097480	3105060	In the vision, Kevin radioed over to K cell that he had quote, eliminated the vector adopted
3105060	3107320	by the Cains.
3107320	3113260	He, John Lee Pettymore IV, was the vector.
3113260	3118720	Clark told John that Keith's vision was of Kevinmore III executing them so that he could
3118720	3120780	have the watch.
3120780	3125040	The three argued which of them was most likely to be the savior.
3125320	3130280	Keith, whose family possessed the watch that recently stayed put on his wrist.
3130280	3133360	John, the original vector, the ball.
3133360	3139760	Or Clark, the overseer and future founder of the circle of knowledge in the past.
3139760	3145160	The tension grew and grew until Keith silenced them with the thought that maybe the real
3145160	3149340	deal here was the three of them needed to come together.
3149340	3152360	Maybe they needed each other, like pieces of a puzzle.
3152360	3155280	John agreed, they could all potentially be vectors.
3155280	3160880	And Clark reminded them the spell Gary put on them as children was meant for all three.
3160880	3167120	If there was only to be one quote, chosen one, why would the spell work on three?
3167120	3172480	To make Keith feel better, John handed over his pistol but immediately regretted his decision
3172480	3174560	and pleaded for its return.
3174560	3179760	As the disagreement continued, the tent at the far end of the underground chamber rustled
3179920	3183160	and out popped a haggard Mildred Mitchell.
3183160	3187760	She held out a piece of paper in one hand but promptly put it in her back pocket and
3187760	3190600	held up a picture with her other hand.
3190600	3195120	Flustered, she sputtered that the picture had changed just then in the tent.
3195120	3199720	She said it was John and then boom, it was Keith.
3199720	3204520	Mildred shoved a picture of the founders of contention into their faces.
3204520	3208200	In the picture was Silas Cole, but she was onto something.
3208200	3213080	It wasn't the Silas Cole the officers remembered learning about in school.
3213080	3217760	That Silas Cole was an extremely handsome man.
3217760	3220740	This Silas Cole had a familiar face.
3220740	3222800	It was Keith Vigna.
3222800	3224640	Clark was the first to put it together.
3224640	3229920	Whoever wore the watch would become Silas Cole.
3229920	3235000	Mildred Mitchell shoved the picture in Keith's face and pointed to a faint reflection of
3235000	3240100	a figure that resembled her granddaughter, Tildy B. Mitchell.
3240100	3243600	Mildred blamed Clark for Tildy's presence in the picture.
3243600	3247860	Clark replied he wasn't the one who loaded and pulled the trigger on the strange gun
3247860	3249560	that sent folks to the past.
3249560	3251640	Tildy had done that herself.
3251640	3256960	During this brouhaha, Keith tried to take the watch off to see how it affected the picture
3256960	3261520	of himself as Silas Cole, but it didn't budge.
3261520	3263440	The thing wouldn't move.
3263440	3269300	Frantic, his panic grew and grew until he snapped and lunged at Mildred Mitchell.
3269300	3276360	Keith tackled her to the ground and viciously slammed his fist down onto the frail old woman.
3276360	3282000	Clark and John were able to pull Keith off of her, but not before he had beaten Mildred
3282000	3283520	unconscious.
3283520	3286960	Keith looked down at his bloody hands and puked.
3286960	3293520	The sick hit a piece of paper that had fallen out of Mildred's pocket in the scuffle.
3293520	3295600	On it, she had written,
3295600	3298920	I'naha for Sa Saia.
3298920	3302680	Harry and Gary approached with guns drawn on Keith.
3302680	3306760	John put himself between them and Keith as he tried to calm tensions.
3306760	3313280	Keith, frightened and embarrassed, fled down the sewer tunnel that led to Bean's Pond.
3313280	3318620	Harry had a dream that if things got too heated, everyone would die.
3318620	3323920	He swiftly and forcefully told the contention officers they needed to leave.
3323920	3330840	Clark asked if Harry and Gary would still be willing to keep an eye on Drew Andrews.
3330840	3331840	And they agreed.
3331840	3337680	The air in the underground chamber was so thick with regret and loss, it was hard to
3337680	3339880	breathe properly.
3339880	3345840	And after turning their backs on the only citizens of contention who had trusted them,
3345840	3351800	John and Clark followed Keith down the sewer tunnel toward Bean's Pond.
3351800	3357600	As they walked through the underground cylinder, Keith continued his attempt to rip the watch
3357600	3360040	away from the skin on his wrist.
3360040	3365720	Tears streamed down his face, and Clark and John attempted to console their partner as
3365720	3371760	they all avoided stepping in the shit sludge that slowly flowed between the walkways that
3371760	3375600	ran along the sewers underneath contention.
3375600	3380260	The trio discussed the probability of each one of them being the savior of contention
3380260	3382300	and perhaps the world.
3382300	3388680	John made things interesting by insisting they take bets on who was actually the chosen
3388680	3389680	one.
3389680	3394760	When they arrived beneath the street across from Bean's Pond, they looked out the drain
3394800	3399040	and saw there was no water in the pond.
3399040	3401280	It had been completely emptied.
3401280	3406700	All that was left was a muddy concavity and a mostly buried metal door.
3406700	3411560	But the three contention police officers saw three different additional objects at the
3411560	3414200	bottom of this barren basin.
3414200	3420320	Clark saw a large aquarium filled with an absurd amount of fish as well as one gaunt
3420320	3421600	little boy.
3421760	3426640	But there were so many fish that the boy couldn't make it up past them to break the surface.
3426640	3429340	He was stuck, drowning.
3429340	3436480	John saw Adam Kane wearing an odd motorcycle helmet with glass tubes and a red light lit.
3436480	3440920	He drew his gun and ordered the pastor to remove his helmet.
3440920	3446880	Keith saw that same helmet sitting in the mud next to the half buried door, green light lit.
3446880	3452440	A gunfight broke out while the contention police officers were still very much unaware
3452440	3454920	of what was real and what was not.
3454920	3459680	Their grip on reality took a toll, but they were able to eliminate their opposition, which
3459680	3466400	turned out to be Asher and Avery Little, the parents of the twins, Aiden and Alice Little,
3466400	3472320	that unknowingly sacrificed themselves to an ooze-filled vacuum bag in an attempt to
3472320	3478640	save James the mill worker, who still died just two or three episodes later.
3478640	3483920	Suddenly, the trio felt their perception shift back to what they considered standard.
3483920	3492080	However, that reality included a six-story-tall wall of water encircling Bean's Pond.
3492080	3497160	Ice formed on the water as fish broke the surface and then broke the theory of gravity
3497160	3502240	as they fell sideways back into the vertical pool.
3502240	3508640	And across the empty pond on the opposite bank, just inside this water wall, Casey Kristoff
3508640	3514380	held a pistol to the back of Kerry Page's body's head.
3514380	3520720	Next to them, Adam Kane gripped the handlebars of the four-wheeler and donned the strange
3520720	3523800	motorcycle helmet, red light lit.
3523800	3529480	Strapped to the back of this four-wheeler was the unnatural radio, green light lit.
3529480	3537320	And atop that bizarre electronic airwave communicator, an extremely determined black cat utilized
3537320	3541440	his claws and held on tight.
3541440	3546420	Surrounded by the water wall, this standoff on either side of the muddy basin stayed still
3546420	3551420	for slightly a second before Keith Vigna rushed down toward the metal door buried equally
3551420	3553480	in between the two groups.
3553480	3560400	However, he ate shit on his drop-in and slid face-first down into the empty bowl.
3560400	3564760	Pastor Adam Kane took the four-wheeler tips down directly toward Keith Vigna.
3564760	3570080	Guns were drawn and aimed, but Casey Kristoff threatened to execute Drew Andrews in the
3570080	3576360	body of Councilwoman Kerry Page's if Clark or John fired at Adam Kane, the former pastor
3576360	3582600	of the First Church of Contention with unsettlingly black eyes and a balloon-shaped head.
3582600	3587260	The current daddy of the First Creek family of contention whipped the back end of his
3587260	3593580	four-wheeler around and sprayed Keith Vigna, already face-down in the stuff, with even
3593580	3594960	more mud.
3594960	3600900	And Agent Trent Chad in the body of Salem, Dr. Marie Jacobs' cat, turned on the strange
3600900	3604460	radio and prepared for a body swap.
3604460	3608480	But Keith wasn't going to let his consciousness get ripped out and stuffed into the body of
3608480	3610140	a cat without a fight.
3610180	3615360	He shoved his mechanical cocaine finger deep into his nasal cavity and sniffed like his
3615360	3617280	life depended on it.
3617280	3622200	With the glass family special powder coursing through his veins, Keith pulled himself up
3622200	3628760	from the mud and smashed one of the odd glass tubes on the radio, just before Agent Cat
3628760	3632680	Chad could initiate the switch.
3632680	3639760	Pastor Daddy Adam Kane, furious, grabbed a fish from his saddlebag, lifted it above his
3639760	3646380	head and crushed the creature over the odd motorcycle helmet, which activated the green
3646380	3647380	light.
3647380	3652540	And suddenly, the former contention police officers were forced to face very real visions
3652540	3654940	of their biggest regrets.
3654940	3658820	Clark saw the Kane family burning up in their minivan.
3658820	3664400	John watched Aidan and Alice Little become enveloped in the ooze.
3664580	3670340	Keith relived the murder of his only brother, Ferguson.
3670340	3676740	When the party snapped back to their current existence, they realized time had passed.
3676740	3683040	Agent Trent Cat had disarmed John Lee Kevinmore the 3rd, and Adam Kane was in the process
3683040	3692860	of dragging Keith Beans toward the half-buried metal door, which began to slowly slide open.
3692900	3699200	The next six seconds were an absolute whirlwind.
3699200	3704400	Daddy Kane dragged Keith toward the open hatch that, for some reason, existed at the bottom
3704400	3706080	of Beans Pond.
3706080	3712240	The sound of a fired gun matched up perfectly, with Casey Kristoff's trigger hand exploding
3712240	3717440	and spraying blood everywhere like a water balloon popped in slow motion.
3717440	3721800	Drew Andrews took advantage and grabbed the fallen gun that had just been pointed at the
3721800	3724540	head of the body he occupied.
3724540	3730900	John looked down and saw that Agent Trent Cat had filled his pistol, named Seth, coincidentally
3730900	3735880	the same name the Kane family originally gave to John, with mud.
3735880	3741760	And as Keith failed in his attempt to fight off Adam Kane, the two of them crashed down
3741760	3747980	into the hole in the ground, and the metal plate closed back over the top of them.
3747980	3754240	In that underground room, Keith saw that Kane had been knocked unconscious by the fall,
3754240	3760440	which broke the glass tubes fixed to the strange helmet on Adam's head.
3760440	3766720	Above ground, in the muddy basin that was once Beans Pond, John Lee Kevinmore slammed
3766720	3771260	his fist down on the closed, half-buried metal door.
3771260	3776760	With advice from John, Keith fired his pistol into both of Kane's feet, and then continued
3776760	3782980	into an elevator, his only forward path in this new and underground space.
3782980	3789440	After he descended even further into the earth, Keith arrived at a blast door, which he opened
3789440	3796460	by spinning a heavy metal wheel and lifting a thick metal hatch.
3796460	3804680	Beans entered an unfamiliar underground laboratory in a cave furnished with file-covered workstations,
3804680	3811260	busy shelving, and massive copper vats housed under a giant rock ceiling.
3811260	3817740	And across the enormous lab, there was another blast door with a round window, a porthole,
3817740	3824980	where the viewer could potentially see whatever it was that was being kept on the other side.
3824980	3831580	In the files and paperwork, Keith found blueprints for three familiar-looking objects, a gun,
3831580	3833960	a radio, and a camera.
3833960	3840740	There were also a bevy of phrases listed, written in a seemingly ancient and alien language.
3840740	3847220	The goal of one specific incantation seemed to be eternal life, but there were myriad
3847220	3848820	side effects listed.
3848820	3855540	Finally, Beans found the project called Manipulating Activator Robot.
3855540	3863900	Versions A through X were a bust, but Manipulating Activator Robot Y had been a success.
3863900	3874480	That project created silver balls, one inch in diameter, and the acronym spelled M-A-R-Y.
3874480	3875780	Mary.
3875780	3881420	Back above ground, John and Clark yelled to the now-safe Drew Andrews that his body was
3881420	3883600	secured down in the sewers.
3883600	3886140	But suddenly, Anne Love appeared.
3886140	3892200	She revealed herself to be Casey Kristoff's Hands Executioner, and greeted her old cellmate
3892200	3897900	Kevin as Clark aimed his weapon at this woman who murdered his parents.
3897900	3904420	She calmly explained that had been done on orders from Jim Cook.
3904420	3911220	After Casell fucked over Marvin Glass by stealing all of his cocaine, Jim initiated what was
3911220	3917300	left of his team, literally just her, into the Circle of Knowledge.
3917300	3924100	Down in the previously undiscovered laboratory below Beans Pond, Keith Beans recited the
3924100	3929180	words of the spell the document suggested imparted eternal life.
3929180	3936540	His words, however, encouraged his bones to vibrate unnaturally, and his nails began to
3936540	3943960	pop off like keratin popcorn, and then BOOM, a hearty thud came.
3943960	3952460	From something on the other side of the closed, thick metal blast door.
3952460	3957560	Clark Bishop, John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth, Drew Andrews and the body of Councilwoman
3957560	3964160	Carrie Pages, and Anne Love stood in the empty Beans Pond and traded information as Clark
3964160	3969760	and John attempted, unsuccessfully, to open the impassable metal plate.
3969760	3975800	Clark lied when Anne asked about Leon Simpson's whereabouts, but she was practically congenial
3975800	3981300	as she answered questions about Maggie Cook's brutal takeover of the Circle of Knowledge,
3981300	3988100	and the necessary death of Maggie's own father, her and Kevin's handler and Casell, Jim Cook,
3988100	3991620	due to the revelations of the overseer.
3991620	3998160	She went on about San Ferra Blum and its ability to pacify entire populations, though it didn't
3998160	4000640	work well enough on Clark's parents.
4000640	4008120	As for Myriad, Anne believed it was a shadow organization that actually ran the government.
4008120	4013260	Drew explained that Adam Kane performed the body switch between him and the Councilwoman
4013260	4016240	after Drew was kidnapped by Fade.
4016240	4021720	Clark and John explained how to find Harry and Gary, who were babysitting Drew's body,
4021720	4027680	down in the sewers, and sent him off on the four-wheeler with the broken radio and Agent
4027720	4029320	Trent Catt.
4029320	4034880	Clark Bishop and two-thirds of the bodies from Casell stared down at the impassable
4034880	4040600	metal plate when suddenly the water wall came crashing down.
4040600	4047160	The pond, no longer held back unnaturally, roared back into the muddy basin it had previously
4047160	4048640	called home.
4048640	4053800	Clark was able to swim through the rushing swell, but John's new body, with the modifications
4053800	4060080	the Glass family had implanted in Kevin, sank, unable to rise up to breach the quickly
4060080	4061960	ascending surface.
4061960	4066460	But Anne Love wasn't going to let her old Casell colleagues stay down.
4066460	4072480	She chanted in an unfamiliar tongue, Kevin Moore's heavy metal body unnaturally moved
4072480	4078520	up and after a moment emerged with a gasp for air from the bionic man.
4078560	4084840	Anne continued her incantation and Clark watched in awe from the shore as she and John stood
4084840	4090800	on the surface of Bean's pond as if it were solid ground.
4090800	4098080	Back down below the impassable metal door in the underground laboratory, a nail-free,
4098080	4105380	impossibly curious Keith Beans peered through the porthole on the thick metal blast door.
4105380	4111940	On the other side, he saw a skeletal creature with skin so thin bones protruded into the
4111940	4113380	dank air.
4113380	4120460	Her nail beds matched Keith's and bruises and lesions covered the body of this teenage
4120460	4121460	girl.
4121460	4128520	But even through her hideous transformation, Keith recognized Tildy B. Mitchell.
4128520	4135440	With pure hatred in her eyes, she shrieked and slammed her fragile frame into the door
4135440	4140000	of her seemingly eternal prison cell.
4140000	4144020	Keith startled and shaken fell backwards onto the ground.
4144020	4149720	The watch on his wrist seemed to activate a small compartment in the ground next to
4149720	4151240	where he landed.
4151240	4158760	In this hidden chamber, there sat an odd revolver adorned with glass tubes and a green
4158760	4160400	light lit.
4160400	4165780	He searched the rest of the floor and found one more clandestine cubby which contained
4165780	4170660	a silver metal sphere about one inch in diameter.
4170660	4176200	Keith pulled out the crumpled picture of himself as Silas Cole turned it over and recited the
4176200	4179440	words written by Mildred Mitchell.
4179440	4183040	Again, Keith's bones vibrated.
4183040	4190400	But then, the metal that formed his upgraded glass family body heated up and his skin,
4190400	4196160	starting with the coke finger, unzipped and bisected the back half from the front half
4196160	4201760	as all the metal detached and fell off of his skeleton.
4201760	4208800	His alloy septum hit the ground with a clank and cocaine poured endlessly from the skinless
4208800	4209800	face.
4209800	4216400	Empty skin just draped over a partial skeleton and then, with nerve endings still popping
4216400	4223300	off like the finale of a fireworks show, the pain indescribable, his bones reformed and
4223300	4230240	his skin sealed itself back around his natural, original physique.
4230240	4235920	Ironically though, being biologically made whole again demanded the little that was left
4235920	4239240	of Keith's mental stability.
4239240	4245840	Unhinged, Keith walked over to the workstation, stuffed his pockets with blueprints and notes,
4245840	4253060	grabbed the strange gun, already loaded with an old, oddly large single bullet, smiled
4253060	4255360	and pulled the trigger.
4255360	4264400	A blinding flash of light dissipated and Keith Bean stood on the dirty, sandy road to contention
4264400	4268880	in the year 1880-something.
4268880	4274540	He immediately stripped nude, ran toward a man in the near distance and called Silas
4274540	4281640	Cole by name as he sucker punched this stranger whose life and name he was about to take.
4281640	4287320	Keith snapped Cole's neck before the man could speak, rolled him over and a tri-folded piece
4287320	4290220	of parchment fell out of the jacket pocket.
4290220	4295700	It was a job advertisement for the contention mining company and it read,
4295700	4305980	We is hiring able bodies, readying untapped sight, plenty of work, hesitate not.
4305980	4312100	Anne's miraculous rescue of John Lee Pettymore from the Bean's pond deluge left John Lee
4312100	4315780	Kevinmore III and Clark Bishop shook.
4315780	4320700	Anne cackled at their shookethness and after they expressed desire to learn, she agreed
4320700	4322360	to teach them the spell.
4322360	4329940	It allowed her to do many things, even walking through doors or leaving folks inside walls.
4329940	4332620	Clark's heart sank.
4332620	4337340	He announced he no longer wanted to learn the incantation.
4337340	4339720	Anne turned the conversation toward the book.
4339720	4340720	She needed it.
4340720	4345360	The overseer was coming and if the circle of knowledge didn't have the book, Maggie
4345360	4348080	said that would be the end of everything.
4348080	4354200	John and Clark played it cool and didn't let on that the overseer was likely standing
4354200	4355440	right in front of her.
4355440	4360960	They asked what this overseer was supposed to do when he came.
4360960	4365480	According to the revelation of the overseer, Jim would die.
4365680	4372680	Maggie believed it was, as the phrase went, only through death that he may rise again.
4372680	4375120	The overseer founded the circle of knowledge.
4375120	4379280	It was only fitting he would come back at the end of everything to save it.
4379280	4385080	Considering the door at the bottom of Bean's pond said Keith was the savior of the world
4385080	4392640	and he believed Clark to be this all-important overseer, John asked Anne if hypothetically
4392640	4398380	there was a third cool thing for a third special person.
4398380	4405040	He was given the answer when his shattered sense of self betrayed the ruse that he was
4405040	4411960	indeed Karen's K-cell partner, Kevin, and he revealed that he was ball.
4411960	4414200	Anne was curious about its mindset.
4414200	4417000	Did it think it was human?
4417000	4422280	John was all too familiar with balls, or vectors as she called them.
4422280	4428120	K-cell's mission had been to eliminate the vectors that were implanted in babies at Cole's
4428120	4436080	orphanage, New School under modern etiquette, and to wipe all records of its existence.
4436080	4438140	John fumed.
4438140	4441380	Clark asked Anne to define her goals.
4441380	4446480	The best case scenario, based on what Maggie told her, was to acquire the book in order
4446480	4450200	to summon the overseer to save the world.
4450200	4451400	Anne made an offer.
4451400	4456480	If they showed her the book, she would get them through the impassable metal door at
4456480	4458680	the bottom of Bean's pond.
4458680	4464040	Clark and John turned their backs in a huddle to confer and decide the best course of action.
4464040	4471120	A decision was not reached before a chanting Anne surprised them both by driving a large
4471120	4475480	knife down through John's skull.
4475480	4480720	Clark speared her back down to the ground and wrapped his arms around her windpipe.
4480720	4488320	John shot her in the knee, and Clark dug his fingers into the squirting, fresh wound.
4488320	4495040	Anne clenched her jaw so fucking tight, her teeth shattered, and she spit the shards into
4495040	4500600	Clark's face as she broke his grapple and resumed chanting.
4500600	4508560	This new incantation telekinetically pushed her blade deeper into John's skull, and blood
4508560	4512040	gushed down his face like a chocolate fountain.
4512040	4517680	As John screamed and fell to his knees, Clark saw the knife move further down through the
4517680	4520040	back of his throat.
4520040	4526880	Anne jumped up and kicked down onto the butt of her knife, and John fell face first, unmoving
4526880	4529600	into the sloshing mud.
4529600	4533800	She turned to Clark and demanded the book.
4533800	4535240	He was stunned.
4535240	4538480	Why did she kill John?
4538480	4540040	Her answer was simple.
4540040	4542480	The vector was her mission.
4542480	4548820	John Lee Kevinmore the Thirth, face down in the mud, felt his ball reach out to the collective
4548820	4554280	unconscious of the entire universe to pick out specific memories.
4554280	4561040	His vision showed Gary Daley pass a book made of uncured leather with acne and stretch
4561040	4565560	marks along the binding over to Eunice and Jerry Bishop.
4565560	4571520	Reality turned and changed, and inside the Bishop home, Clark's parents hid the book
4571520	4580000	in a safe with an alphabetical keypad entry below their television inside a hidden compartment
4580000	4583080	within the entertainment center.
4583080	4590960	Barely clinging to life, John lifted his knife-clogged head from the muck in the mire
4590960	4596280	and told Anne he knew where the book was.
4596280	4603520	Anne chanted swiftly withdrew her blade, made a bloodletting cut on her own hand, and a
4603520	4608620	stream of her blood coagulated to fill the vacant wound.
4608620	4610100	Clark's mind snapped.
4610100	4615140	He ripped the knife away from Anne and mirrored her actions step by step.
4615140	4623900	He chanted, made a cut on his thumb, and similarly, the blood flowed over and into John's orifices,
4623900	4625220	healing him.
4625220	4629040	This new power confirmed Clark's suspicions.
4629040	4631720	He was the overseer.
4631720	4637620	He screamed as he executed the woman who killed his parents.
4637620	4641880	They didn't need her anymore.
4641880	4649860	Clark Bishop plunged Anne Love's own knife into her skull, and she died.
4649860	4655060	As they walked to the Bishop house, the pair heard screams from the direction of the First
4655060	4657120	Church of Contention.
4657120	4664720	Clark assured John that when they found the book, the return of the overseer, his return,
4664720	4668300	would fix everything.
4668300	4673560	When they arrived, John revealed a false compartment beneath the television.
4673560	4679840	Inside his entertainment center, Clark found a safe with an alphabetical keypad entry.
4679840	4682180	He remembered the words of his mother.
4682180	4684260	Life is like the bonus round.
4684260	4687040	We were already given the best letters.
4687040	4694700	He typed in R-S-T-L-N-E and the door unlocked.
4694700	4701840	Inside was a book bound in uncured leather with some acne scarring and stretch marks
4701840	4703460	on the spine.
4703460	4708620	Clark grabbed the book, and his vision turned blank.
4708620	4713300	Suddenly he stood in the abandoned water park Splashylvania.
4713300	4719500	He looked up at the two-fanged plunge, and Julie Maxwell fired a bullet through Leo Piston.
4719500	4725560	Clark raised his firearm and shot Julie Maxwell, whose body joined Leo's as they slumped and
4725560	4729220	slid down the pair of intertwining waterslides.
4729220	4733660	Then he was in the street outside of Dr. Marie Jacobs' house.
4733660	4739220	He saw James the mill worker float off the ground as Aiden and Alice Little bravely held
4739220	4741460	a vacuum up to the man's feet.
4741460	4748820	The vacuum bag burst open, and a squeamish black ooze covered the twin children.
4748820	4753020	Clark saw the children fight violently against the muck that encompassed them.
4753020	4754380	He looked over to John.
4754380	4759100	The residue dripped from every orifice in his face.
4759100	4764740	With another blink, Clark sat in a cage with a gaunt young boy above a debaucherous crowd.
4764740	4771840	Electric shocks racked their bodies, and the ceiling slowly descended.
4771840	4777700	Clark didn't want to do it, but it was either one of them died, or they both died.
4777700	4783660	Clark pushed the boy back into the juice box just as the ceiling came down, and squeezed
4783660	4787380	the boy pulp all over the crowd below.
4787380	4793620	Another blink, and Clark saw himself all over CSU campus in a grotesque montage, murder
4793620	4795540	after murder after murder.
4795540	4802880	It culminated in the moment when Clark jammed a sharpened screwdriver into his own eye until
4802880	4805700	the handle was flush with his socket.
4805700	4812980	Blood dripped down his face, and Clark Bishop crumpled to the ground, limp and lifeless.
4812980	4813980	Blink.
4813980	4817140	Clark stood in the muddy water of Bean's pond.
4817140	4820860	He knew what he was capable of, what he was.
4820860	4826660	He buried the knife into Anne Love, the woman who murdered his parents.
4826660	4828260	A final blink.
4828260	4831060	He was back in the living room of his parents' house.
4831060	4836500	His hands were covered in blood, and the blood moved between the covers of the book
4836500	4841460	and formed new pages, a record of his actions.
4841460	4847020	The book flung open, and these new pages flitted indecisively before they settled on a page
4847020	4853000	on which Clark's blood formed the letters of a new incantation over a picture of a hooded
4853000	4856900	figure that was clearly a young Clark Bishop.
4856900	4862100	Compelled, Clark chanted the spell again and again.
4862100	4868140	John saw a blinding flash of light, and then Clark disappeared as if he had never been
4868140	4869500	there.
4869500	4870660	Clark was gone.
4870660	4872560	The book was gone.
4872560	4879420	John pressed play on the VCR, laid down on the couch, and watched some Wheel of Fortune.
4879420	4881720	But Clark?
4881720	4888000	Clark stood in a dark alley on the night of December 1st, across from a man he recognized
4888000	4892620	as Jim Cook, the man who gave the orders to murder his parents.
4892620	4898920	The handler of Kacelle, a member of Myriad, the former leader of the Circle of Knowledge,
4898920	4902480	Maggie Cook's father, Jim Cook.
4902480	4905720	Clark remembered what happened next, he'd seen it in a dream.
4905720	4910360	Before he could think, Clark pounced on him, his hands wrapped around Jim's neck as he
4910360	4911360	growled.
4911400	4915320	They didn't have to die, they didn't have to die, you couldn't find it, they didn't
4915320	4916320	have to die.
4916320	4924000	His grip tightened, and Clark Bishop felt the passing as Jim Cook's life was extinguished.
4941360	4963280	Can't you hear the wolves howling all around my poor little darlin', all around my poor
4963280	4964280	little darlin', I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'.
4964280	4968680	Can't you hear the wolves howling all around my poor little darlin', all around my poor
4968680	4972200	little darlin', I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'.
4972200	4978600	Can't you hear the wolves howlin' all around my poor little darlin', all around my poor
4978600	4984200	little darlin', I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'.
4991200	4997520	Back in 1880-something, when this land was stolen and pioneer towns began to form, Keith
4997520	5004760	Beans pretended to be Silas Cole as a miner in the mine that employed the town of Contingent.
5004760	5011200	While down in the mines, Keith Bean came upon a familiar odd black substance, and he became
5011200	5013900	obsessed with studying it.
5013900	5018960	The substance was invisible to others, but not to Cole.
5018960	5025480	He utilized blueprints he had stolen from the hidden laboratory underneath Beans' pond,
5025480	5030200	and exploited the residue's unnatural qualities.
5030200	5034040	Silas Cole became an inventor.
5034040	5039160	He made so much money off of his inventions that he bought the mine.
5039160	5044440	He built an office on the top floor of the tall, skinny mining company building that
5044440	5047700	sat right above the mine itself.
5047700	5054080	He harvested the substance and acquired a much firmer grasp on its tendencies.
5054180	5061480	Keith Beans invented wild, magical things like ceiling fans.
5061480	5068320	Each new invention brought him wealth and power, but also released more of this inky
5068320	5071520	residue into his town.
5071520	5078860	To satisfy his newfound hubris, he began working on the creation of a manipulating activator
5078860	5083980	robot, or ball as they had been called in his past life.
5083980	5089720	Versions A through X were a bust, but Y was successful.
5089720	5097760	The project formed a silver ball, one inch in diameter, and Mary Cole was spawned.
5097760	5102180	Sometime thereafter, Keith Beans got a blast from the future, his past.
5102180	5107500	Tildy B. Mitchell appeared on his property in a blinding flash of light.
5107500	5113660	He became paranoid that townsfolk would see her and realize he was also from the future.
5113660	5118900	Consumed, he decided this town wasn't big enough for the two of them, and since Tildy
5118900	5123580	B. couldn't exist, she made for an excellent test subject.
5123580	5130620	But some of those tests turned her real rambunctious like he went to work on building a secret,
5130620	5137020	subterranean workshop where he could hide her away and continue working on his inventions
5137020	5143900	some of which he was scared to share with his newly minted confidant, Mary Cole.
5143900	5149100	But before it was finished, the mutated Tildy B. Mitchell got out and caused some real trouble.
5149100	5155560	She'd gotten loose before and took out basically the whole saloon staff, but this?
5155560	5161220	This was trouble with a capital T, which rhymed with C, and that stood for covered up barely.
5161220	5165900	Shoot, there were suddenly four good people missing.
5165900	5174820	Everett Pace, a homesteader, Professor Horace Green, a professor, Jack Perlman, a rancher,
5174820	5181420	and finally Preacher Sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard all disappeared.
5181420	5184580	The heat was on.
5184580	5192420	We'll end here with the supposed words of Roy Bean, a horrible man and judge from Texas
5192420	5198580	known for hanging folks who actually didn't really hang many folks.
5198580	5207580	He allegedly said, you can't tell how good a man or a watermelon is till they get dumped.
5207580	5208580	Hmm.
5208580	5230580	Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darlin', all around my poor little darlin', I'm afraid they'll get my darlin'.
5230580	5244420	I have to hop in here to give the shoutest of outs to Haiku Jason.
5244420	5249480	This fucker right here helped me out Peter Gabriel style big time.
5249480	5254060	They wrote six episode recaps and they were good too.
5254060	5256200	Jason earned themselves a shirt.
5256200	5263420	So one final thank you to Jason, I Shot Marvin, Here Be Tigers, Crush 36, Stingray, and Dylan
5263420	5268440	B. Y'all made this process so much easier to bear.
5268440	5270320	Shirts all around!
5270320	5275120	As for the rest of you, I sought advice from Taylor on what to say here and she said to
5275120	5276360	just be honest.
5276360	5282680	Well, the truth is I still really love playing Delta Green with my best friends and I still
5282680	5291380	really love making this show, but I was completely unprepared for how much work this job over
5291380	5293040	here in Korea was going to be.
5293040	5299520	I signed up for like a hundred hours a month, easy peasy I thought, but I'm basically working
5299520	5305600	full time with a commute on top and working with six to twelve year olds is fucking exhausting
5305600	5310140	and it has clearly gotten the better of me.
5310140	5316040	My contract ends in a little over two months and I am looking forward to having more time
5316040	5322740	to deliver the quality content I believe in at the release rate I think you deserve.
5322740	5326300	Even more than that, I'm just fucking stoked to keep role playing with my friends on a
5326300	5327300	regular basis.
5327300	5329480	I've missed it so much.
5329480	5334600	So while I'd love to give you an exact date for our next episode and say that we'll be
5334600	5341100	back to the weekly format, I'm really afraid, like I'm really afraid I won't be able to
5341100	5344300	deliver and that will destroy me.
5344300	5347180	So as Taylor suggested, I'll just tell you the truth.
5347180	5350320	Episode a hundred will be out as soon as I can get it finished.
5350320	5353220	I'm shooting for like two weeks from now.
5353220	5358680	From there, I do believe we'll be able to release on a more consistent schedule, but
5358680	5363980	we do have some super fun irons in the fire, merch, bonus episodes, guests, it's all happening.
5363980	5369420	Thank you all so much who have stuck by us and continued to re-listen to all the episodes
5369420	5373460	and care about this story we've spent so much time creating together.
5373460	5379380	I promise this is not even close to the end of pretending to be people.
5379380	5383180	We have so much more smoke in the tank.
5383180	5388460	Honestly, the thing I'm most scared of is trying to find a jam for season two that's
5388460	5395640	even close to as bangin' as this new track I just heard like 85, 86 minutes ago.
5395640	5401700	It was Kudzu with no backbone.
5401700	5406220	Kudzu with no backbone.
5406220	5410140	Kudzu with no backbone.
5410140	5415260	Kudzu with no backbone.
5415260	5425100	Kudzu with no backbone.
5425100	5428300	Hot dog.
5445340	5451340	The only one trying to pull over.
5451340	5460140	How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?
5462140	5466140	With no backbone.
5466140	5470140	No backbone.
5470140	5474140	No backbone.
5475260	5478140	No backbone.
