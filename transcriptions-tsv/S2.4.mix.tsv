0	3580	Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
3580	6140	It's your moon howling and scowling
6140	10320	Puparoni with the side of extra cheese wolf the dog
10320	14520	The moistest DJ this side of the solar highway
14520	20140	And I am a-wooing at you live from 694.2 PTBP
20140	23080	The greatest radio station that ever did
23080	27000	Now let's move on to the greatest things y'all ever did
27000	28740	Write me fan mail
28740	33820	This week's Howlin with Wolf is from at black goat underscore M10
33820	37980	Who instagrammed about the show and tagged at pretending pod
37980	41700	What a super cool way to let your friends know you're a freak
41700	42660	He writes
42660	44660	Greetings Mr. Wolf
44660	48140	Pretty new listener and first time howler here
48140	49240	Great show
49240	52780	I've not really been into RPGs before
52780	57420	But I really enjoy the gang's escapades and contention in the city
57420	58940	Keep up the good work
58940	61820	Big shout out to Victor for sending me your way
61820	66180	Appreciative howls from Mattias in Sweden
66180	67500	Mattias
67500	71180	Are you telling me that THE Victor sent you?
71180	73060	What did he tell you?
73060	75340	Who do you work for?
75340	76420	Mattias
76420	78380	You're on thin ice buddy
78380	80500	And you better watch your back
80500	82340	And you tell Victor
82340	84700	Tell him that Wolf says
84700	86260	Hello
86300	89100	If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl
89100	91540	Tag at pretending pod on twitter
91540	94940	Tag at pretending pod on instagram like Mattias
94940	98300	Or tag at pretending to be people on facebook
98300	102900	Wolf and his producer haven't spent a single dime on advertising
102900	106460	So y'all all here because of words in mouths
106460	107900	Or words in posts
107900	110260	Or words in comment sections
110260	112980	The point is words are powerful
112980	117060	Please use yours to share this show with your friends
117060	118340	Your co-workers
118340	119900	Your grandparents
119900	121540	And step-cousins
121540	124980	And as a reward for your sharing I'll do two things
124980	128540	One, I might choose you to submit a howling with Wolf
128540	134220	And two, I might and definitely always do put the links in the show notes
134220	139740	And while you're posting on them socials about 694.2 PTBP
139740	144260	Keep them ear holes open and receiving my dulcet tones
144260	146900	It's time for the news
146900	150300	Last time the field team at City Action News
150300	154940	Showed the good people of TikTok a glimpse into the calzone
154940	159500	On their way to a potential story from a woman named Kaylee Silver
159500	163380	What they found was the scene of a gruesome homicide
163380	165860	After watching footage from the Furbo
165860	169180	It's clear that Kaylee Silver walked over to her fridge
169180	170340	Cracked a beer
170340	172540	And her friend Kaylee Gold's head
172540	175340	Unnaturally snapped toward the kitchen
175340	180820	Before this differently dispositioned Kaylee Gold lunged at the apartments resident
180820	182100	Kaylee Silver
182100	184540	The attack took place out of view
184540	186420	Behind the kitchen counter
186420	190740	But it seems Kaylee Silver stabbed her friend repeatedly in the neck
190740	192500	With her broken beer bottle
192500	196140	Until Kaylee Gold's head was all but decapitated
196140	198140	Thankfully for this story
198140	200700	The can crew called the city cops
200700	201980	Made statements
201980	206060	And headed off to cleanse their palates with a drink at the foundry
206060	209220	Taking us there now is a bop that don't stop
209220	211020	Good shit that don't quit
211020	213260	An anthem for the handsome
213260	214940	It's Alter Girl with
214940	218620	My Life is Great and It's All My Fall
228140	244060	My Life is Great and It's All My Fall
255060	257460	Also why would we do a season one name?
257500	260780	Everyone from season one is dead to this podcast, Luke.
260780	262780	We are moving on. This is season two.
262780	266540	Dude, Thomas, ask me anything about season one.
266540	267700	What's season one?
267700	271220	I don't remember.
271220	273940	Welcome back to season two of Pretending to be People.
273940	276780	If you got into this podcast because of season one, thank you.
276780	281020	But honestly, that shit is over and done.
281020	288100	And this is a new era of excellence and groundbreaking podcast roleplay.
288100	289820	Straight up, dude.
289820	293380	Get your two tight britches on, which is a reference to nothing.
293380	298860	If you listen to season one, stop listening right now.
298860	300860	Stop. Yeah, you need to stop.
300860	304660	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, keep going.
304660	308620	The britches this, oh, I feel like I'm, am I clipping for you guys?
308620	309140	A little bit.
309140	310500	I feel very loud.
310500	311500	I'll turn you down.
311500	312700	Turn me down a little bit.
312700	313940	I'll just talk louder.
313940	315980	Oh, the cat's going in the pod box.
315980	317020	Cat in the pod box.
317020	325940	I will say the main difference after listening to the edited version of the first episode of this season.
325940	328940	Yeah, like once it was edited, we were funny and good.
328940	333740	Exactly, but after listening to that, huge differences.
333740	337580	The britches are going to be small this year, this years.
337580	339620	This years?
339620	341100	All right, they were big in that thing.
341100	343940	They were big last time and now they're small.
343940	346260	Hey, Zach, are they coming out of the ******* world right now?
346260	346860	No.
346860	348100	Oh, okay, nevermind.
348100	352420	Which is a reference to nothing.
352420	359420	Zach is currently aggressively kissing our cat.
359420	361300	And the first two times she was like, yeah, sure.
361300	366020	And then the fifth time she was like, I'm not going to sit on this ******* couch with you anymore.
366020	367100	You lost cat privilege.
367100	372660	Okay, so obviously I know the answer to this, but Joe, where exactly did we leave off last time?
372660	375940	Oh, dude, you should have seen the crazy **** that I saw.
375940	382500	A girl killed another girl in an apartment and it was messed up and we were all kind of exasperated by it.
382500	388060	And so Cal, Colorado asked us to go to the foundry to maybe wind down.
388060	394220	Which is not a reference to the old Joplin, Missouri music venue.
394220	396020	It's a reference to what, Zach?
396060	398140	Oh, it's a reference to what, Thomas?
398140	400620	I don't remember exactly, but isn't it a newsman's bar?
400620	403380	I believe it's a bar specifically for newsman's.
403380	404660	That's right.
404660	406620	I remember the whole thing.
406620	409060	I knew the whole time I knew that.
409060	411220	So vroom, vroom?
411220	412100	Vroom, vroom.
412100	414620	Vroom, vroom.
414620	420940	Julius Summers pulls into the parking lot of the foundry.
420940	422700	Yeah, where's the foundry located, Thomas?
422700	424660	What kind of bar is this?
424660	429660	It's got like dive bar aesthetics, but much like Cal, Colorado's house, there are pictures
429660	432500	all over the walls of local news people.
432500	438820	And it's kind of maybe equidistant downtown from the three different local news stations.
438820	444340	And so they all come and relax and unwind there and talk shop afterwards.
444340	447700	Are there any TVs on the walls at all?
447700	453140	Are they showing the news at this place or is it specifically to unwind away from that?
453140	454140	I think they are.
454140	457580	I think they never play sports, just the news.
457580	460140	How many news channels are in the city?
460140	461140	He just said there are three.
461140	463660	Okay, there's three TVs then.
463660	468540	I think the foundry is like in an older building downtown, but just absolutely like always
468540	470700	in the shadow of these skyscrapers.
470700	477220	We're in like the downtown railroad like intersect.
477220	478220	I love it.
478220	481560	It's right where the train rolls by and there's a...
481560	483060	They do train shots.
483380	485580	Yeah, of course they do train shots.
485580	492780	So pretty much every time this foundry is like rumbling with the train that is basically
492780	494980	right outside its back door.
494980	500420	There's just a shitload of like attractive people in good suits like getting fucking
500420	503220	hammered and the trains come by a lot.
503220	507820	That's one of the reasons that they chose this place because it's very hard to overhear
507820	510140	the conversation like anybody else is having.
510140	511140	You have to lean in close.
511140	515420	It's a great place to like protect your sources.
515420	521040	In your mind, is this place filled with producers and talent or is my ilk of the camera man
521040	522540	and crew there?
522540	524540	Everyone comes to the foundry.
524540	525900	We're all friends at the foundry.
525900	529980	Color 10, KY3, any of the other ones?
529980	533540	I don't think we're like referencing specific networks, but it would definitely be like
533540	540460	the local ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, like local anchor people all hanging out there except
540460	546420	it's CAN, NNN, Nightly News Now.
546420	548500	ETC is there.
548500	549980	ETC, which is...
549980	550980	Ethical...
550980	553860	This is going to be like PBS and nobody watches it.
553860	554860	Ethical...
554860	555860	Television.
555860	556860	Television channel.
556860	557860	Channel.
557860	560860	Joe, you do one.
560860	565700	Yeah, now that we said them all.
565700	568300	RBQ, you guys have fun.
568300	571020	It's sponsored by Arby's and it's barbeque.
571020	572020	Barbeque.
572020	573420	Yeah, Royal Broadcasting.
573420	574420	Quarterly.
574420	578980	They only air three months.
578980	588100	Anyway, I've speedily pulled into...
588100	590540	I screech into the parking lot of the foundry.
590540	593700	Does Beck say that?
593700	595700	Unless Julius goes...
595700	602740	Yeah, no, Julius pulls in like as any normal person would into a parking spot, but as he's
602740	604540	doing it, he goes...
604540	609780	And then he kind of like looks around at the other two and sees Cal is not laughing.
609780	616200	No, Cal is like holding onto the oh shit handle and is like is clutching at his chest.
616200	623360	Keep in mind throughout these interactions of the sites you just saw at the apartment,
623360	625280	the high rise that you were just at.
625280	628280	Yeah, I bet you we land in silence.
628280	630880	I bet you we pull in a little somber.
630880	632960	I was going to mention, I don't think...
632960	634440	He would not bring his camera in here.
634440	638800	I think that this is a sacred place that he knows not to film and that's a very out of
638800	639800	character for him.
639800	640800	So you guys walk across...
640800	644900	This is like where the witches and the witch hunters meet.
644900	648940	There are as many people outside smoking as there are inside.
648940	649940	Also smoking?
649940	657620	Yes, this is a smoking bar, but it's a nice day.
657620	661860	It's a cool evening from an oppressively hot, hot day.
661860	667060	The humidity kind of dies off into the night and you've got kind of a cool summer evening
667060	673140	as you guys walk across this gravel parking lot and head around back to the entrance of
673140	675900	the foundry on the train track side.
675900	679060	A train is currently finishing up.
679060	686540	It's bustling through this back area and you see a server is haphazardly making their way
686540	690180	through the smokers outside with train shots.
690180	693460	He's yelling, train shots, yeah, who had the train shots?
693460	696300	We got a whole mess of them here.
696300	701020	Cal just like silently takes one off the tray and downs it and puts it back on the tray.
701020	706500	Julius grabs one, takes it, and then puts $2 down on the tray.
706500	707500	Nice.
707500	711900	Which train shots are specifically a special here at the foundry.
711900	721780	It is a single dollar for a shot of whiskey when the train toots its horn as it drives
721780	722780	by.
722780	728460	Oh God, if it's fucking like dollar whiskey, we're talking old crow or worse.
728460	729460	Oh, it's old granddad.
729460	730460	Brown derby select.
730460	731460	It's old granddad.
731460	732460	It's old granddad.
732460	733460	Oh yeah.
733460	734460	Orange bottle.
734460	742180	And you set this down and the server looks at Cal Colorado with a certain appreciation
742180	745260	as he carries on with his job.
745260	747860	I think he knows to just add it to Cal's tab.
747860	748860	Nice.
748860	756680	Julius did put the $2 down on his tray even though he knew that those were not poured
756680	758820	out for Cal and Julius.
758820	764340	Immediately you hear him as he walks over to a group who's calling him over with the
764340	765340	train shots.
765340	768060	He's reassuring them like, yeah, no, I'll be right back.
768060	769220	I'll be right back.
769220	775740	And their understanding after seeing the looks on the pained faces of Cal Colorado, Julius
775740	778880	Summers, and Beck Wilder.
778880	779880	Probably like we recognize.
779880	781780	Are they just like local news crew?
781780	783520	Yeah, it's just another local news crew.
783520	790020	They hold up their shots to you as they all wait on the other two shots to come, which
790020	792200	come quickly and you're all able to.
792200	796720	Beck takes his head off and does an exaggerated bow and puts it back on.
796720	801200	Guys, this is my first time in here.
801200	802200	Very excited.
802200	803600	I've heard a lot about it.
803600	806680	This is the first thing that maybe like brightened Cal's face in a while.
806680	809520	Like he gives a very knowing look to Beck.
809520	813200	Well, we have a first timer here.
813200	814960	I think you know what that means, Becca.
814960	818780	We exchange a look and you see a big smile on Beck looking at you.
818780	823960	Are you thinking like we're going to do like do the full set up like now?
823960	829720	Maggie doesn't let any first timers in without putting them through the printing press.
829720	835500	Oh, Julius, my man, you're going to have fun tonight, dude.
835500	836640	It's going to be good for you.
836640	838720	You're going to want to shake off what we saw earlier.
838720	843560	You're going to forget all about that weird, horrible home brew murder.
843560	849720	I mean, I don't know that I'll forget about that anytime soon, but no, the images will
849720	857360	haunt you for the rest of your life, but we can obliterate them temporarily.
857360	859360	The printing press?
859360	860360	You'll see.
860360	865620	Julius starts walking faster and wants to be the first one in there because he's stoked
865620	870800	to see what the hell the printing press is.
870800	874500	Do you think that you and I have a booth that we haunt?
874500	875500	Probably yeah.
875500	876500	I think that'd be cool.
876500	883180	Julius has done his research asking his uncle all about these guys, so he knows which booth
883180	887780	it is.
887780	892020	So Julius goes and sits down in the booth that you guys usually go sit down.
892020	896220	Do you go sneak in right before Beck gets there?
896220	901140	Leading the way, I'm just going and sitting down and turning around like, look what I
901140	902140	know.
902140	903700	Hey, that's the one we always sit at.
903700	904700	That's weird, dude.
904700	905700	Cool.
905700	913340	Hanging Wes Anderson style directly center frame of the booth is an old picture of Cal
913340	921220	from the night after his first television broadcast as a head news anchor, and it's
921220	927420	beautifully framed in this old oak wooden frame and is sitting gloriously.
927420	928540	He looks like a kid.
928540	929780	The suit's wearing him.
929780	933460	Yeah, Cal sits purposely with his back to that.
933460	934460	In what way?
934460	938900	Is it so that when people look at it, they see your face next to your face?
938900	944700	What they're going to see is a much younger, more handsome man with a huge smile on his
944700	950900	face next to that, aged 30 years and looking absolutely miserable tonight.
950900	955580	It does have that effect that those are contrasted, but he's not trying to do it as a power move
955580	956580	or anything.
956580	957900	He just doesn't want to catch sight of it.
957900	958900	Sure, sure, sure.
958900	965860	As Julius slides into the booth, he's not saying anything, but wiggling with excitement.
965860	968380	He's wanted to do this for so long.
968380	972560	Just be a producer and be part of the news and be able to get into this place.
972560	974140	He is so fucking stoked.
974140	980820	Julius, if you wiggle like that during the printing press, you could lose a finger.
980820	982140	Printing press.
982140	984420	I want to find out what it is.
984420	986420	Your research didn't tell you what it is.
986420	988820	My uncle would not tell me.
988820	989820	That makes sense.
989820	991820	I mean, it's kind of a closely guarded secret around here.
991820	996220	I don't think that anybody goes out there just telling other people about it, you know?
996220	999180	They never do, if they want to live.
999180	1000980	Only kidding.
1000980	1004500	It's a process that happens in three steps.
1004500	1012100	The first step, you are laid across the bar and your belly is exposed.
1012100	1017820	Julius pulls his shirt up as he lays on the table and then realizes what was said and
1017820	1019680	then he goes and sits back down again.
1019680	1022420	Tell him the second part.
1022420	1026580	This is kind of like your last moment of choice here, but you get to decide what liquor you
1026580	1027580	want.
1027580	1031420	Once you're laying on the bar with your shirt up?
1031580	1034620	What would be your choice if you said your favorite liquor?
1034620	1035620	Tequila.
1035620	1041520	Ooh, that's a bad choice to try on.
1041520	1048100	The third step is more tequila than you've ever had in your life, with hungry news crews
1048100	1059180	eagerly licking it off your midriff as Maggie, the hardened barkeep, pours a bottle into
1059180	1060180	your mouth.
1060180	1062540	Same, by the way.
1062540	1069660	So the tequila gets poured into my mouth and your belly button.
1069660	1080500	And they let the older interns just absolutely go at you.
1080500	1085800	So at this point, you're probably asking what's in it for you.
1085800	1087300	The deep respect that comes.
1087300	1095060	I spent a lot of my time in college practicing for this day.
1095060	1097860	Oh, you've had a lot of people lick you.
1097860	1099260	I wish.
1099260	1102540	Oh, has anyone licked you?
1102540	1107780	Julius gets up from the booth and walks over to the bar with his, while he's like untucking
1107780	1115060	his shirt from his pants, his all tan suit.
1115060	1119340	Oh, I thought you were going to describe your body and I was like, he strikes me as
1119340	1121340	a very pale man.
1121340	1122340	He's pretty pale.
1122340	1123340	Yeah.
1123340	1133460	You see a trunk of a woman in a denim vest with long, a long braid down the back of her
1133460	1134460	hair.
1134460	1143980	She clinks a bell above her head and she's like, hot off the press.
1143980	1149540	Oh, that's right.
1149540	1154780	We got a newbie over at city action news.
1154780	1163620	Come on down everyone for Julius Summers.
1163620	1169060	He's in for the printing press, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang, and the entire crowd
1169060	1173620	in circles, like all the smokers come inside when they hear the bell and immediately jackets
1173620	1174620	come off.
1174620	1177860	Ties are loosened, top buttons are undone.
1177860	1183020	And like these very dorky, like you see the interns start circling and they all look like
1183020	1184700	Jonah from Veep.
1184700	1194260	Julius is laying on the bar with his like shirt kind of pulled up, exposing his stomach.
1194260	1208700	And then one of the Jonah interns just rips all of his like upper clothing off.
1208700	1217900	And the chants fade away, much like Julius's memories from the entire night.
1217900	1224700	Beck and Cow, however, don't get printing pressed by a bunch of rabbit interns and therefore
1224700	1228660	are able to keep their wits in their brain helmets for the evening.
1228660	1229660	Let's go check that out.
1229660	1234900	And Oh, Hey, thanks so much for listening to pretending to be people probably means
1234900	1237340	you're fucking cool.
1237340	1246660	We've got a very special guest on today's episode of pretending to be people.
1246660	1251860	I had an idea in my head when we were discussing the recording of season two, Joe and I had
1251860	1257420	talked about who his character would interact with the most.
1257420	1262420	And your answer to that was a mother.
1262420	1263420	The answer was mother.
1263420	1264420	Yes.
1264420	1268060	I think you specifically told me I can't have dead parents this time.
1268060	1275100	Well, not yet, not yet, exactly.
1275100	1281380	And when you said mom immediately, I thought, well, let's get our podcast, uh, dad to come
1281380	1284820	on and play Beck Wilder's mom.
1284820	1288820	It's Scott Norwood is back!
1288820	1290940	Thank you very much for having me back on.
1290940	1295300	And like, this isn't the first time I've been called a mother, but at least the circumstances
1295300	1297300	are different.
1297300	1303020	Well, we really appreciate you coming on for those of you who are just hearing Scott on
1303020	1307140	pretending to be people for the first time for some fucking reason.
1307140	1312360	Scott is my parasocial RPG mentor.
1312360	1319900	He didn't know that he was my mentor, but listening to his podcast that he does with
1319900	1326660	Matt Sanderson and Paul Fricker, good friends of Jackson Elias truly developed me into the
1326660	1329380	GM that I am today.
1329380	1334220	And I am super appreciative of all the lessons I've learned listening to their podcast over
1334220	1335220	the years.
1335220	1336220	Oh, blimey.
1336220	1342740	I thought I'm still amazed that anyone even listens to it.
1342740	1346380	Scott before I was ever aware of who you were, I knew that Zach listened to your podcast
1346380	1350780	and you answered some questions for him one time and he was so excited and told us all
1350780	1351780	about it.
1351780	1355780	And that was way before there was ever a glimmer of hope of meeting you, let alone playing
1355820	1356820	No, yeah.
1356820	1361280	We weren't even talking about recording a podcast, but I was running Helen Texas, which
1361280	1366920	is a scenario that you wrote for the book, The Things We Leave Behind by Stygian Fox
1366920	1368340	Publishing.
1368340	1375100	And that's a great book and your scenario in it is so terrifying and awesome.
1375100	1379880	So I posted some questions on the subreddit and you yourself came in and answered them
1379880	1387720	and I lost my fucking shit, Scott.
1387720	1391600	I waste half my life on Reddit.
1391600	1396080	It is my main time sink and I am not proud of that.
1396080	1401540	Well that time sink made this nerd super happy and validated many, many years ago.
1401540	1402640	So thank you for that.
1402640	1405720	Some might say this podcast wouldn't exist without you, Scott.
1405720	1409640	You gave him the hope, the drive.
1409640	1413000	It's all my fault now, is it?
1413000	1416000	We have to pin it on somebody.
1416000	1432560	I would like to take us to the home of Beck and Kim Wilder as Ramona scoots her cat.
1432560	1436600	Zach has a cat food bowl that is one of those ones that's like a maze.
1436600	1438600	Yeah, it keeps Ramona nice and...
1438640	1440120	But it kind of becomes a game.
1440120	1442880	Smart, yeah.
1442880	1448040	Yeah, she grabs each piece individually and then eats it out of her own paw, which is
1448040	1450440	rad.
1450440	1452400	But noisy, I imagine.
1452400	1453320	Quite noisy.
1453320	1458320	I'm going to move it into the back room.
1458320	1462680	I barely get through a recording session without one of my cats running into the room and
1462680	1468160	screaming like a seagull or jumping all over things and knocking shit over.
1469160	1473320	My cats are named Chaos and Anarchy, and it's with good reason.
1473320	1476400	That's great.
1476400	1481560	Beck Wilder has had a brutal day.
1481560	1482560	Started off fine.
1482560	1491440	Woke up around 2 p.m. in your tighty-whities, in your messy bedroom, headed off, shot a
1491440	1493680	segment out on a farm.
1493680	1494680	He had a rough evening.
1494680	1495680	Was it evening?
1496200	1499160	Yeah, it was a rough evening.
1499160	1503680	You were called out for a potential story that was...
1503680	1506400	We weren't even 100% sure what we were going out there for.
1506400	1507560	And what did you find?
1507560	1510320	Oh, man, it wasn't good.
1510320	1517280	It was a terrible, terrible crime scene, including a partially severed head.
1517280	1520840	That wasn't what Beck was thinking was going to happen that day.
1520840	1523560	Yeah, I mean, a severed head is bad enough.
1523560	1526840	A partially severed head sounds worse.
1526840	1532720	Yeah, it's a lot worse.
1532720	1533720	Just holding on.
1533720	1537640	Just a little hinge.
1537640	1539200	Beck isn't in the greatest headspace.
1539200	1542800	He's now just gotten back from the foundry, where he had a nice night trying to drink
1542800	1543800	his troubles away.
1543800	1545840	Are you feeling a little loose?
1545840	1547760	You feeling a little warm in the face?
1547760	1550320	Beck always feels loose.
1550320	1554960	He's maybe a little bit looser than normal, but he kind of lives in an equilibrium of
1554960	1555960	inebriation.
1555960	1560360	A loose state, I like that.
1560360	1564640	So as you arrive home, it's late at night.
1564640	1571320	It's 1130 PM, maybe even midnight, which is about as late in the night as you can get.
1571320	1573640	Before it starts becoming morning.
1573640	1576640	That's right.
1576760	1580920	Kim Wilder has the home to herself.
1580920	1590240	Her son is a mid-thirties field cameraman for City Action News, and he is still living
1590240	1593160	in your house, Kim.
1593160	1597320	For now.
1597320	1601200	What is Kim Wilder up to on a random Saturday evening?
1601200	1608320	I think she's sitting there on the sofa, knitting and watching television.
1608320	1614880	The sound is way down on the TV, and there's just the clack, clack, clack of knitting needles.
1614880	1620960	And somehow she is managing to make knitting look angry.
1620960	1626480	Out of the corner of her eyes, she just keeps darting her eyes over and stabbing them into
1626480	1633000	the corner where Beck keeps his camera equipment, which is not there at the time, but there's
1633000	1641040	like a whole corner of this room that is specifically set up to house Beck's livelihood.
1641040	1642200	Oh yeah.
1642200	1646160	You can tell exactly where it is just by all the scuff marks and the skirting board and
1646160	1650000	the floor tiles.
1650000	1656120	And the last you saw Beck, it was maybe even yesterday because today you knew that he was
1656120	1657120	in his bedroom.
1657120	1662880	You knew that he had been sleeping in, but you went to knock on his door for tea or snack
1662880	1664960	or he wasn't even in there.
1664960	1667400	He just left the house without saying anything.
1667400	1673440	And as those thoughts are flowing through your brain, the front door swings open.
1673440	1676440	Hey, Ma, you're up.
1676440	1678880	Oh, this is awkward.
1678880	1684880	Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
1684880	1691720	I thought that was a burglar coming in, but no, it's just my son staying out all hours
1691720	1693040	again.
1693040	1695800	And where have you been tonight, young man?
1695800	1697280	Get some drinks with the boys.
1697280	1703160	You know, it's, uh, uh, I had a, I had a bad night, Mom.
1703160	1711000	Yes I could, I can smell just how bad your night was from here, yes.
1711000	1716000	You're not going to bed until you put something in your stomach to soak up some of that beer.
1716000	1722200	There's still some hot dog casserole in the oven, it's probably, oh, it's probably burnt
1722200	1726200	to a crisp by now, but well, give it a try.
1726200	1730720	I cut up the wieners nice and small, just the way you like it, just the way I like it.
1730720	1735520	Cut up more hot dogs.
1735520	1739760	Beck starts walking toward the fridge and you can tell now that he's a little drunker
1739760	1741320	even than you've ever seen him.
1741320	1743600	He's a stumble-ier than you've ever seen him.
1743600	1750680	And he kind of catches himself, woo, a little woozy, sorry, sorry about that, Ma.
1750680	1756800	It uh, I know we don't like to talk about like what I do, but like, I saw some shit
1756800	1758680	tonight Mom, it was bad.
1758680	1762280	And what exactly did you see?
1762280	1766920	Oh, it's kind of like a thing that's like under investigation now.
1766920	1771320	I don't know if like, I might need a lawyer to talk to you about it.
1771320	1777000	Honestly, I really don't understand why you can't have a proper job.
1777000	1778320	You're out all hours.
1778320	1782840	I never know whether I'm going to find you sleeping in your room in the middle of the
1782840	1787080	afternoon or whether you're going to stay out until three o'clock in the morning.
1787080	1790760	Clearly what you're doing isn't making you enough money for you to actually move into
1790760	1792440	your own place.
1792440	1798200	And now you're saying that it's dangerous as well, and it's going to get you into trouble.
1798200	1799560	Why do you do this?
1799560	1801780	Why can't you just get a proper job?
1801780	1808280	You know, Macy Grindel's son, Deke, he's got, he's got a nice thriving business for himself
1808280	1814020	selling secondhand sofa beds and he's moved into a new apartment downtown.
1814020	1815280	It's all his own.
1815280	1820100	Well, I think he's got a couple of flatmates, but he's not living with his mother anymore.
1820100	1821100	That's the important thing.
1821180	1823580	Yeah, but Deke's a fucking asshole.
1823580	1827260	Oh, not this again.
1827260	1829020	Jesus Christ.
1829020	1831420	He's a financially solvent asshole.
1834060	1837660	Sorry, uh, the, uh, the internet connection cut out a little bit right there.
1837660	1847660	He's a financially solvent asshole.
1847660	1848300	Brilliant.
1851260	1855580	As Kim started to go into that diatribe, Beck had his back to her and he was kind of mouthing
1855580	1856700	along with these words.
1856700	1858140	He's heard it so many times.
1861500	1863180	Oh, she's got to mention Deke again.
1863180	1864380	She's got to mention Deke.
1864380	1865500	Oh, there we go.
1866300	1867420	Playing the greatest hits.
1869340	1872380	If you love Deke so much, why didn't you give birth to him?
1875260	1877980	Don't think that I haven't thought about that every day.
1878060	1879100	Ew, gross mom.
1879100	1881180	You think about fucking Deke's dad?
1883420	1885900	A wistful look crosses Kim's eyes.
1891820	1896380	For like half a second, I thought we were going to get something like really meaningful
1896380	1899500	when Kim was like, why do you even do this job?
1900780	1903500	And then Beck's like, go fuck my friend's dad.
1908620	1914220	At this point, Beck has lost the gusto for the hot dog casserole and it's just kind of
1914220	1918540	like slopping it onto a plate and throwing it in the microwave and is trying his best
1918540	1920300	to like avoid eye contact with you.
1921340	1925980	Look, Ma, I know that it's like not like the best paying thing in the world, but it's like
1925980	1927420	what I want to do.
1927420	1932860	Like, I don't know if you can understand like happiness from that perspective, but that's
1932860	1934620	what I've got for me right now.
1934620	1941740	Look, you've got to understand that part of being a grown up is that we all have to do
1941740	1948860	things that we don't want to do, because that's just how we get through life.
1949580	1956380	And yes, all right, you can run around doing your camera stuff and whatever it is you do
1956380	1957820	at three o'clock in the morning.
1957820	1964700	And I try not to judge you, but sooner or later, you've got to grow up.
1964700	1970300	You can't just carry on like this and pretend that everything's all right.
1971420	1975660	You've got to you've got to grow up someday, boy.
1976540	1981820	Beck is now kind of a little more solemn and a little more introspective visually.
1982540	1986220	And he pulls the food out of the microwave and he's holding the plate and he's kind of
1986220	1987340	picking at it with a fork.
1987980	1990300	Yeah, I mean, fine.
1991340	1993900	We disagree on like fundamental things, Ma.
1993900	2002140	I just maybe someday you'll see that I can do this and also like be successful, whatever
2002140	2003100	that means to you.
2004300	2005580	I'm going to my room.
2005580	2006140	All right.
2006140	2008380	You'll have to pick up the clean sheets.
2008380	2011580	I've left them out for you, but you'll have to make the bed yourself.
2011580	2017740	And I tried to get the stains out, but we're going to have to try a new brand.
2023020	2023260	Yeah.
2023260	2023660	Okay.
2023660	2024380	Thanks.
2024380	2025180	Thanks, Mommy.
2025980	2026940	You got any milk?
2033740	2038780	Scott, we didn't bring you on here to roleplay anything other than what's about to happen.
2041580	2047980	Oh, Scott, thank you so much.
2047980	2049580	I think that's the end of the night.
2049580	2050300	That was perfect.
2055100	2057820	Oh, Scott, as always, an absolute pleasure.
2059260	2060060	Oh, thank you.
2061020	2065100	Zach, we live in a weird privileged world that we just had Scott Dorward on to play
2065100	2065820	my mom.
2065820	2066940	And I said, thanks, Mommy.
2066940	2067580	Got any milk?
2067580	2074060	And then we said, have a good day.
2074060	2075420	That is going to haunt me.
2080220	2081260	Scott, thank you so much.
2081260	2082940	Seriously, thank you so much.
2082940	2089820	And for those of you who enjoyed Scott just now, you can hear him.
2089820	2095420	He runs two different full scenarios for us on pretending to be people in our bonus episodes
2096140	2098140	here on the main feed.
2098700	2104940	Scott, you ran Bleak Prospect, a Call of Cthulhu scenario that you wrote so fucking creepy.
2104940	2107100	It's one of my favorite things that we've done on the show.
2107100	2108060	It's so fun.
2108060	2111900	Starts in a Hoover town and goes to worse places.
2111900	2112400	Yeah.
2113980	2119980	And you also recently ran a Pulp Cthulhu scenario, both of which, by the way, that Scott wrote.
2119980	2122380	This one was A New Age of Wonders.
2122380	2128780	And that was, for me personally, I think one of my absolute favorite player experiences
2128780	2130380	I've ever had in an RPG.
2130380	2130940	Oh, man.
2131500	2132780	Oh, I'm glad you liked it.
2132780	2134540	I had an absolute blast running it.
2134540	2135100	You did, too.
2135980	2136940	That's so fun.
2139180	2139500	All right.
2139500	2145180	Well, I'm going to stop gushing and we'll see you soon, Scott.
2145180	2146060	Oh, marvelous.
2146060	2146780	Look forward to it.
2146780	2147420	Good night, Mommy.
2149900	2151260	Got to go and have a bath now.
2152380	2165500	You're just now joining us.
2165500	2167660	Welcome back to Pretending to Be People.
2167660	2171100	We are here with a special guest right now.
2171100	2179420	It is the GM of the Lost Mountain Saga, one of the best players from Glass Canada Network's
2179420	2180780	Androids and Aliens.
2180780	2185660	It is Eleanor de Lorenzo.
2187180	2188620	Let's get one that the people can hear.
2191580	2196300	It's fun to talk like this, but I don't know if anybody can understand Eleanor de Lorenzo.
2198140	2199180	Hey, Ellie.
2199180	2199680	Hello.
2200220	2201500	I understood.
2201500	2203020	There were compliments in that.
2203020	2203820	I understood that.
2204860	2206860	I sucked that up right up.
2206860	2208300	I picked those out right away.
2209020	2210700	Thank you so much for coming back on.
2210700	2212700	Thank you so much for coming and joining us again.
2213820	2216140	I'm so excited to be back.
2216140	2217260	Thank you for inviting me.
2217260	2222060	If you're listening to this and you haven't heard Ellie on Pretending to Be People before,
2222060	2226380	Ellie was a guest and a player when I ran a homebrew scenario that I wrote,
2226380	2230380	Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt for her and some other guest players.
2230380	2232940	And we had an absolutely phenomenal time.
2233660	2238140	You were such a wonderful player that I was so excited to bring you back on.
2238780	2242940	Another huge reason that I was so excited to bring you on is when I told Thomas, I was like,
2242940	2247740	Hey, dude, Ellie from A&A is coming on Pretending to Be People.
2247740	2248060	Yeah.
2248060	2251420	And then you had her play with a bunch of people who weren't fans of that show,
2253740	2255820	which as a fan was like, well, that's a bummer.
2257500	2262620	Couldn't have anyone except me getting too starstruck on her first appearance on Pretending
2262620	2263260	to Be People.
2263260	2263740	Fair enough.
2263820	2268460	You wanted to protect her from what's about to happen.
2268460	2268960	Yes.
2269660	2273580	Slobbering idiots of the PTBP pod.
2273580	2275260	I love slobbering idiots, though.
2275260	2277260	That's what I'm more comfortable with.
2277260	2277980	Do you know what I'm saying?
2278540	2282140	Now I played with very talented, wonderful women and they were all great.
2282140	2284460	But that sounds deeply intimidating.
2286540	2287660	They were hot.
2287660	2290460	They stared at me with their hot eyes.
2290460	2293500	And one of them was apparently married to you, Zach.
2293500	2294300	That is correct.
2294300	2294700	Yeah.
2294700	2295260	Apparently.
2296780	2297420	Apparently.
2298060	2298300	Yeah.
2298300	2300140	Allegedly married.
2300140	2302220	Taylor and her hot eyes are married to Zach.
2303420	2304940	I'm an allegedly lucky man.
2308940	2309440	Okay.
2309980	2313340	I'm not going to correct that just because I'm waiting for all the chinks in your marriage's
2313340	2316940	armor to collapse at once.
2316940	2317660	Coming in hot.
2317660	2318300	Coming in hot.
2318860	2319500	Love it.
2319500	2320860	I'll have to beat Luke off, but.
2321820	2322220	Wow.
2322220	2322940	I'd watch that.
2323500	2326700	Well, so Thomas, are you married?
2326700	2327660	Uh, no.
2327660	2328460	No, I'm not married.
2328460	2329740	You said that very quickly.
2329740	2332460	No, it was like, it was like a gut reaction.
2332460	2332700	No.
2332700	2334220	Well, I remembered that I wasn't.
2335180	2335420	Right.
2335900	2338140	Well, you looked back at your whole life.
2339820	2343420	Did I leave a wife somewhere along the road?
2343420	2346300	It's like when people ask you if you're like, do you have any kids?
2346300	2348140	And you're like, not that I'm aware of.
2348140	2349260	It's like, do you have a wife?
2349260	2351900	Not that I'm aware of.
2351900	2354540	I'm known for not knowing much about America.
2354540	2361500	And I just realized that I know you guys are from a state, but I don't remember which state
2361500	2363020	right this second.
2363020	2365180	Is it Missouri?
2365180	2365820	It is.
2365820	2367820	Oh, wow.
2367820	2371420	I was going to make a joke about you have a one in 50 shots, so just go for it.
2371420	2373020	You fucking nailed it.
2373020	2373740	I did.
2373740	2374780	Got it in one.
2374780	2378860	It is indeed Missouri, which we like, but a lot of people don't.
2378860	2379660	Oh yeah.
2379660	2380380	We love it.
2380380	2381340	It's nice here.
2381340	2382220	It's really hot right now.
2382220	2383260	Actually, it sucks here.
2384940	2389100	Oh, but still, I would love to go, but like, is it nice because it's like, you know, you
2389100	2393020	can be on a horse ranch and I'm sorry.
2393020	2393580	You can be.
2393580	2395100	Yeah, you can be on a horse ranch.
2396140	2396700	Okay.
2396700	2402860	Well, I mean, I don't make very much money and this is my house that we're recording
2402860	2402940	in.
2402940	2408860	Oh, screw you and making fun of my bullshit New York studio cabin.
2411740	2412620	But that's true.
2412620	2414860	That's a really cool thing about Missouri.
2414860	2416620	You have an actual kitchen.
2416620	2417120	I love that.
2418060	2420300	I want a Missouri kitchen.
2420300	2424460	Let's get into Cal, Colorado.
2425020	2426940	Cal, you've had a very interesting night.
2426940	2432380	I want to dive back into some of the things that you've seen here on this random night.
2432380	2434060	You were, oh, yeah.
2434060	2438780	That makes sense because one of these memories that keeps just blasting into your head as
2438780	2447500	you're leaving the foundry is just this headless, almost headless neck held on by a couple of
2447500	2453580	tendons and skin on one side.
2453580	2459180	Your mind drifts immediately from this severed neck off to your daughter.
2459180	2459740	A little bit.
2459740	2464780	Mostly my mind is just shouting neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as I see like this horrifying
2464780	2468540	like red flash and this image of this nearly headless neck.
2468780	2471580	Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you get into your car.
2472300	2476700	Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you drive really far back to your home.
2477580	2481180	Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole, neck hole everywhere.
2482060	2486380	Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you sit into your chair.
2486380	2489660	And he turns on a 24 hour news channel like he always does.
2489660	2490160	Natch.
2490940	2491980	Drown it out, baby.
2491980	2495500	Honestly, the cleaning person must have turned it off because he kind of likes to just keep
2495500	2496460	it on all day.
2496460	2498620	But yeah, he turns that on.
2498620	2501740	He goes over to his pretty dusty home bar.
2502540	2509500	He grabs a glass and takes a bottle of cheap white wine out of the refrigerator and pours
2509500	2513020	it to the brim and then downs that and pours another.
2513020	2518700	And at that moment, you feel a vibration coming from your pocket and it's not the vibration
2518700	2519820	of a text or a call.
2520700	2522540	Do you not have a phone that vibrates?
2522540	2525500	No, he does, but we don't do vibrates here.
2525500	2528460	We have a ring on this podcast.
2528460	2529020	That's right.
2529020	2531260	Ring, ring, ring, ring.
2531260	2533660	Yeah, he hears the ringtone set to his daughter, Carol.
2536300	2537660	Eleanor de Lorenzo.
2537660	2542060	What is Carol's face look like on the screen of Cal's phone here?
2542060	2545100	It's a young woman, young 20s.
2545100	2549260	She currently looks a little flushed as if she might have been, I don't know, working
2549260	2550300	out or something.
2550300	2555100	But since Saturday night, you might assume that she might be a little tipsy and she's
2555100	2559660	sitting down on a couch that you recognize to be her student room.
2559660	2559900	Hey.
2562940	2566540	Oh, Carol, it's lovely to hear from you.
2566540	2567020	I'm sorry.
2567020	2571180	I've had kind of an extraordinary evening.
2573020	2573820	Honey, how are you?
2573820	2577180	Dad, can you tilt your phone up a little bit?
2577180	2580220	I can't see you like you're filming your forehead again.
2580220	2581980	He tilts it down and you can just see his chin.
2581980	2584940	Is this better?
2584940	2585820	No, please.
2586940	2590620	You remember, like, you can put it a little bit further away from your face.
2590620	2591660	Then that works better.
2591660	2594940	You just see one giant eye as he's looking into the camera lens.
2594940	2595980	It's all right.
2595980	2599020	And she puts down the phone and it's just voiceover.
2603500	2608540	Honey, I'd love to see your darling face, especially with you so far away from home.
2609100	2610700	Please explain FaceTime to me.
2611980	2616540	Oh, Dad, have you been drinking?
2617180	2619340	Not just a little wine.
2619340	2620780	It's a Saturday night.
2620780	2622620	I'm a single man.
2622620	2625420	Can I not enjoy a sifter of wine?
2625420	2626220	No, of course.
2626220	2628540	Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you a little bit about.
2628540	2632540	I wondered if you have you been doing anything fun lately?
2632540	2633580	Like, except working.
2634780	2636380	Work is fun, sweetie.
2636380	2638140	Your mother and I always tried to tell you that.
2638140	2639100	No, I know.
2639100	2639500	I know.
2640060	2641980	I just, I don't know.
2641980	2642700	I worry about you.
2642700	2647020	That's why I just wish you, you know, would get out there a little bit.
2647580	2650700	Cal thinks about where he just got out to and pauses.
2651500	2655180	And he kind of gulps and he's like, I get out, sweetie.
2655180	2659260	Just today, I saw some corn wrestling while I was out on assignment.
2659260	2662460	They also had crabs, not the men, the farm.
2663420	2664780	They raised corn and crabs.
2665820	2666380	All right.
2666380	2667180	So I get out.
2667180	2669900	Yeah, no, I get it.
2669900	2670460	I know.
2670460	2677660	I just, I don't know if you, I'm sure you already heard, but mom, I think mom's seeing someone.
2678860	2680620	Yes, I heard.
2680620	2682540	He's quite a bit younger too.
2682540	2684220	I heard he was 40.
2684220	2689820	Yeah, but I mean, after you turn 25, it's like age doesn't matter anymore.
2690620	2691120	Oh.
2692080	2698720	She says that with 100% sincerity, because she thinks that if you're over 25, you're
2698720	2704960	ancient and you can tell that suddenly Carol seems a little bit nervous.
2705680	2706960	It's yeah, I don't know.
2706960	2708640	Is there something else on your mind, sweetie?
2708640	2712160	Well, promise you won't get angry.
2712880	2713920	I promise.
2713920	2721040	Well, you know that I know, you know, that I always wanted to make you happy and that
2721040	2724000	that's why I went to journalism school.
2724000	2729040	Of course, just like your mother and I, you went on to journalism school to continue the
2729040	2733840	family business, which is your ultimate dream and desire, of course, right?
2733840	2734560	Right.
2734560	2740160	But well, I've decided and she suddenly gets like defensive as if she's ready to fight.
2740880	2744080	I've decided that I'm not going to do that anymore.
2744080	2749600	I've decided that I am going to pursue something else, something that I am passionate about
2749600	2751120	and it's not journalism.
2751120	2752000	It's not writing.
2752000	2754320	It's not any of that.
2754320	2757280	I have decided I'm going to become a nature photographer.
2760000	2764960	Well, sweetie, that's that's wonderful.
2764960	2765360	Really?
2765360	2769840	You know, photography is still technically journalism.
2773360	2778880	Sweetheart, I just want you to know that no matter what you choose, even if you're not
2778880	2784320	a world class news anchor like me or a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist like your mother,
2786080	2792000	we're happy that what you have chosen is still inexplicably linked to the nexus of
2794000	2799920	of reporting and well, you know, showing the truth of our world to the people.
2799920	2800560	That's what it's all about.
2800560	2805280	OK, well, see, see, that was like I knew that you were going to react like that.
2805280	2808720	So now I'm going to tell you the real my real job.
2811200	2812320	I'm going to tell you the real.
2813200	2815360	It's still related to photography.
2816640	2824960	Yeah, but it's like for like beautiful women posing without clothing.
2824960	2827760	Pornography, pornography.
2827760	2830720	It's not it's not pornography.
2831360	2834240	It's boudoir photography.
2834240	2835600	Oh, I'm sorry.
2835600	2836720	Nerd pornography.
2840880	2841840	See, this is the thing.
2841840	2842880	You never understand.
2842880	2844080	You mock everything I do.
2844080	2845680	That's the problem with you and mom.
2845680	2846880	You're both academics.
2846880	2848400	And I don't want to be involved with this.
2848400	2850080	Like, I don't want to go to school anymore.
2850080	2851280	I'm going to buy my camera.
2851280	2856480	I'm going to take pictures of my friends and and they will pay me eventually.
2856480	2859440	And then I'll start an Instagram account and I'm going to make a lot of money.
2859440	2861040	And there's nothing you can say or do.
2861680	2864080	And yeah, roll grip check, dad.
2864080	2866080	No, I think he's no, no, no.
2866080	2867040	This is hold on.
2867040	2869680	This is specifically because of what you've seen tonight.
2869680	2871840	And the amount of grip that you lost.
2871840	2874400	It is going to affect the relationships that you have.
2874400	2874800	Yeah, I know.
2874800	2877760	But I was like what I was just about to say was all about that.
2878320	2878880	Oh, okay.
2878880	2880400	Why it actually wouldn't.
2880400	2882880	Well, that's part of the game is you have to roll to do that.
2885520	2889120	Yeah, he hates the dice, but he succeeds.
2890080	2890480	Okay.
2890480	2890720	Yeah.
2890720	2891280	All fair enough.
2891280	2898720	Uh, so you see from the part of your father's chin that you can't see it like quivers a
2898720	2905360	little bit, but then he, then he composes itself and he says, honey, your mother and
2905360	2908400	I will support you no matter what you choose to do.
2908960	2910480	We only want you to be happy.
2910480	2916000	And tonight I saw some horrible things that I can never unsee.
2916720	2922880	If you can make beautiful art and put it into this world, that is enough for me.
2923760	2926960	You're going to want to approach this more carefully with your mother.
2927840	2929600	We may not tell her until you've graduated.
2930480	2931760	Well, I'm not going to graduate.
2931760	2932640	That's the thing.
2932640	2934000	Right, right, right.
2934000	2937600	Until you burlesque photography.
2937600	2943440	Well, I'm, this is a whole new world for me, pumpkin.
2943440	2946320	So dad, are you, are you all right?
2946960	2948640	You said you've seen some horrible stuff.
2948640	2949920	I didn't see a neck hole.
2951520	2952000	Sorry.
2952000	2954160	Uh, one of the wrestlers broke his arm.
2954160	2955360	It bent the wrong way.
2955360	2956400	It was gnarly.
2958560	2960800	I love that Cal picked up the word gnarly from Beck.
2962800	2964000	Oh no, Jesus.
2964000	2964320	All right.
2964320	2965440	Is he going to be okay?
2965440	2966000	Yes, sweetie.
2966000	2967280	I think he'll be fine.
2967280	2973360	Everything will be fine in the world and you will, no matter what you choose to do, you
2973360	2975440	will be an important contributing part of it.
2975440	2977600	And your mother and I love you very deeply.
2977600	2981680	Well, I love you too, dad, but, and she's starting to get worried.
2981680	2984160	Like, wow, he really needs to start getting out there.
2987520	2992560	I don't know that I know it's not my business, but I think it would be good for you to like,
2993200	2998640	there are apps you can download that would like match you with other women.
2998640	3001200	I just don't want you to be like, be alone.
3002160	3004320	I'm not alone, sweetie.
3004320	3007200	I have you, I have my memories.
3007200	3009360	He points to all the pictures around the house.
3009360	3010800	Oh my God.
3010800	3012960	See, that's the definition of being alone.
3014320	3017200	But I will try to get out there more.
3018000	3020000	What are these women apps you told me about?
3020800	3023840	Well, one of them is called Bumble.
3025200	3028160	I mean, like when you've downloaded them, let me know and I'll give you some advice
3028160	3033840	because you can't be like, like, don't start commenting on women's profiles like a weirdo.
3036160	3038000	How do you comment like a normal low?
3038000	3041680	Well, you just wait for them to like, you put up a nice picture of yourself
3041680	3043600	and then you write something nice about you.
3043600	3048480	Like you're an established journalist and then you wait for women to contact you.
3048480	3051120	Is there an app that finds me a woman exactly like your mother?
3054320	3054800	Dad.
3055920	3056420	What?
3058160	3062320	Maybe you should go for the complete opposite.
3063520	3064080	Like a guy?
3067280	3067920	Well, maybe.
3069440	3070320	I don't know, man.
3073120	3077680	Carol, I promise you, I will look into online dating.
3077680	3078000	All right.
3078000	3079360	Carol, exciting news.
3079920	3082400	Do you post your boudoir pictures on TikTok?
3082400	3083120	Well, okay.
3083120	3085920	So dad, you can't follow my friends.
3085920	3087760	Like, they are not part of the dating pool.
3088720	3089520	No, no.
3089520	3090400	Have you heard of this?
3090400	3091520	Have you heard of TikTok?
3093680	3095200	Of course I've heard about TikTok.
3095200	3095920	Oh, I'm sorry.
3096640	3099120	Well, I learned about it today and I did a dance.
3100160	3102480	Carol, no, you should see the dance I did.
3102480	3105120	It's posted on the can TikTok for the station.
3105920	3106720	People liked it.
3108480	3110000	Hey, you'll see, I'm out there.
3110000	3115600	Hey Carol, when you pull it up on your phone, you see it's called the calzone.
3115600	3116160	Oh God.
3116720	3117520	Oh God.
3117520	3122720	And he's doing a dance with a random guy on the street who's doing a very cool dance where
3122720	3128880	it looks like he's sitting while he's upright and dancing around in the sitting position.
3128880	3131600	And Cal does it perfectly alongside of him.
3131600	3132320	Wow, dad.
3132320	3134000	Actually, that's pretty impressive.
3134000	3136160	You should actually, you should keep doing that.
3136160	3140000	I'm in a weird twisted reality that we currently live in.
3140000	3143360	You would actually find more dates based on this video.
3143360	3145120	With women like your mother?
3146160	3150400	Maybe women like my mother.
3150400	3156160	Sure, but you should not narrow your, like, there are plenty of women out there that aren't
3156160	3156720	like mom.
3157360	3158560	Oh, well, that's the problem.
3160240	3160960	All right, dad.
3162160	3166960	I have to go, but thank you for being supportive of my choices.
3166960	3171200	Try to get some sleep and then maybe we'll, yeah, we'll, I'll check in with you tomorrow.
3171680	3177360	But I still, until I have some money, maybe don't cancel my credit card yet.
3179520	3181680	I wouldn't dream of it, sweetie.
3181680	3186000	But again, don't tell your mother she would cancel them in a heartbeat.
3187200	3188160	Thanks, dad.
3188160	3190560	Yeah, take care of yourself and I'll talk to you tomorrow.
3190560	3192560	I love you very much.
3192560	3193920	I love you too, dad.
3193920	3195680	And I, yeah, thank you.
3198160	3198660	Thank you.
3199220	3201540	This has been Cal Colorado.
3201540	3202580	Have a pleasant evening.
3203700	3205140	You really don't have, okay, fine.
3208740	3211300	Ellie, thank you so much for coming on the show.
3211300	3211940	Oh my God.
3211940	3212420	That was great.
3212420	3212980	That was fun.
3212980	3219300	I'm very much looking forward to seeing how this relationship thrives or...
3219300	3220260	Yeah, it was very normal.
3220260	3225060	Like, I love how, like, I expected Zach to come in and be like, and then all of a sudden
3225060	3227540	her head falls over, like she dies.
3228180	3229460	And I'm like, okay, cool.
3229460	3230580	We got a long ways to go.
3230580	3232660	We got time to fuck this shit up.
3232660	3235140	Yeah, there can definitely be a phone call where your head falls off.
3236020	3237220	Hey, if that's what you want.
3237220	3240500	Is season two a homebrew as well?
3240500	3241460	Yeah, very nice.
3241460	3242420	It's all I can do.
3242420	3243220	I don't like reading.
3244260	3245300	You actually can't.
3246740	3247700	I'm too stupid.
3248340	3248980	It's a shame.
3257540	3277540	My life is great and it's all mine Cause my life is great and it's all mine
3287540	3288620	I
