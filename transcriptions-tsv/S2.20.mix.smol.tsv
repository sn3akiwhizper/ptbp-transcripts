251760	257800	Is that right hard to remember down here in this dark place where the hours pass?
258320	261600	immeasurable made to contain a golem born of
262060	267600	Desperation and malice and built by those who wish to contain that which they did not understand
268000	271720	This labyrinth has lain forgotten for a century
272040	278160	Yet the beast still lives for I hear its ancient voice in the echoes of rattling bones
278760	281340	In the beast it hungers
281920	288280	Shout out to Pavlo Mason and Brock for trusting me to run them through their first session of Delta green
289720	297640	Damn Duncan sounds like you live in an eternal nightmare from which you may never come back from and that sucks
297880	302940	But what doesn't suck is that you decided to take a break from your horrid
303200	309780	Conditions to write a letter to little old me and for that I send you immense gratitude
309800	313120	I hope one day you can get out of that labyrinth

546820	548820	Which at this point in time is it?
549380	553980	$500 already, so we're gonna match that we're already gonna be able to donate over $1,000

561260	566100	Yeah, it'll come right before this. So this is a letdown. Let's get in the episode. That's what she said
568180	572060	Far back to remember it'll come right before this so that will be a letdown
577100	584460	It's the demons which ones the God all the gondol demons the god old name, I think he meant goons, but he said demons

618980	620980	Spelled badego wrong

627300	630540	B AG le BAG al that's
630820	632820	Sounds like I
632860	640620	Spelled that in my notes as bidet gal. So I would remember how to say it instead. I read it as badego
643180	645180	Yeah, you should have maybe gone for an UH
645860	651540	Deagle the deagle the deagle goal and we found we we found out our stuff get done

656900	658900	Listen to season one
659500	666060	Which was not a mistake on our part, but in fact incisive commentary the entire time as we played cops
667340	670460	incisors used our trench and make those
671900	675800	Trench mouth gum disease I had in college. Let's move
676540	681620	Yeah, what the dentist said the nobody had gotten it since 1917

690240	696740	Pussy Zach. No, no, no, you're no no, I'm supposed to write. I'm supposed to have better self-talk than that. I
697420	699420	Wasn't ready for college
699900	702420	That's better. So you got a World War one disease
704100	707460	You weren't ready for college because you were a little pussy
708380	711260	Now that that's cleared up we can talk imagine
711580	715820	Imagine if that Zach had been sent to World War one dead so quickly

832660	835860	Was absolutely obsessed with a b-minus movie
837780	842540	It's working its way through through your ranks already though, you said c-plus I think
843060	849300	I quickly autocorrected. I don't remember it other than I saw it and I was like you speak the true true
850500	853700	Sounded like it was about geography and I wasn't ready for it. Oh
854340	856340	It'd be so much better
856940	858940	Here we are

887180	892460	3 p.m. At this point. We do not have a lot of time to get this on the evening news. We have to find this footage
893740	898820	Let's go straight to the security office. We gotta see like if there was any like identifying Mars
898820	901620	Maybe we could see the car that they drove. It was a police car
901620	905660	I think she said it's gonna have like a number on it. Sounds good to me. Let's let's do that
905660	906540	Let's review the footage
906540	914060	So you guys head to the can security office over the marvelous floor the glass and the beautiful?
914620	917340	Can station you walk through the halls?
918220	923580	Confidently, there are other people here at the station. So on the way there Beck
923580	930980	I'm gonna need a grip check for you for the attire of some of your co-workers that you're passing through the hall
931020	933540	I pass 35 and a 49 nice
933540	940540	So you see you start to see these flashes as these people approach and how do you like contain yourself?
940540	942540	It's a head down looking at the feet
942740	949260	Like like somebody who is trying to be as inconspicuous as possible and just get through this hallway to the other end
949260	951540	And you've been through these hallways time after time
952180	959820	in the morning and you pass through the same way you always head to the can security office and as you guys pass in you
959820	965780	See that's on shift today is ray. It's Raymond. It's the son
966500	970100	Perhaps the the worse of the sons of tife
970860	976800	Rayland so Julius, this is your cousin cousin cousin ray ray
977100	985020	Yep, cousin ray ray and he's like on his phone feet up in the chair not looking at any of the
985780	993020	Myriad screens on the wall in front of him with this range were made by myriad. There's a little logo and
994260	997060	He's watching tiktoks on his phone. He's just like
1000900	1006280	And you hear the tiktok voice over the top like walking with my partner in
1007820	1010020	Frisco Julius walks over
1011020	1014180	Julius has never really it when you call it Frisco
1014660	1020300	Julius has never really liked ray ray so he goes over and he sees him screwing off and
1020540	1025340	Just kind of like pushes his feet off the desk and makes his chair like swivel around school

1073760	1077800	Hey, hey, Zach. What time was this you guys left around like midnight?
1077800	1082360	So you're probably looking at like 12 15 12 30 except it was like even later
1083320	1088160	Because I went to the hospital cuz you're like everything's negative 40 if you do anything else
1088560	1093720	So I was like, I'll go sleep. So it's like 3 so you guys are looking at like 3 15 3 30
1093720	1095720	We
1096600	1098940	Left the offices like a roundup
1100040	1102040	Here's you guys leaving?
1102200	1108560	Okay, it would be shortly after this. Yeah, we're looking for two men and a he plays it at regular speed
1108560	1112520	Can you go quickly Ray Ray? Yes, please fast fast Ray Ray
1113080	1115760	Beck is gonna push him out of the way because he knows how to use this equipment
1116840	1122600	Come on, man. At least let me do it. It's my only job. You do well Ray Ray Beck is the best and time is of the essence
1122600	1125600	You just got to turn the knob it it sets it up to be 1.5 speed
1125600	1127600	It's good. We might even want to go to at this point
1128960	1137320	Okay, let's take a double and he goes to two times speed pushes it through and we see Vivica sneaking back
1137960	1144800	into the city action news station after you all have left looking over her shoulder the whole way through as she
1145000	1150600	Crosses into the foyer. She digs deep into her pocket. She pulls out this thumb drive
1151600	1158560	And there's this determined look in her not grainy face because it's pretty decent quality
1158880	1161660	This quality is amazing even five years ago
1162120	1166600	She would have been grainy as fuck and then she puts the thumb drive back in her pocket
1166600	1173960	It shows it in there and heads back into the editing Bay surely in your minds to delete the footage or at least take it
1173960	1176540	What was my character's name when we played with?
1176980	1182440	Can I say the name and don't has it has it been played already? No, it hasn't come out yet her name is
1183200	1188940	What's up? What was my guy's name? He owned a security company. So you see the the security system is made
1188940	1195440	We just looked it up. What's who's the security system made by Vincente boring? Yeah, so it's the security system called like
1200900	1205340	Yeah, it's on there yeah, you'll have to wait to hear Luke's character who chokes every line out
1206980	1212100	Oh, wow, this is the best security system in the whole city. I
1214740	1221980	Actually had these people install some security in my home and both my my Peabody and three local Emmys were stolen in that time. I
1222820	1227500	Ended up going with Shakira toss. Well for your home, you should go with a ring doorbell
1230980	1235700	Target oh, I do have a ring doorbell found a target but for for the office, it's a fun story
1235740	1241780	We actually used it to some effect earlier to see Stevie running away from my basement with her brother. That's that's right
1241780	1247020	I remember on that beautiful ring doorbell crystal-clear picture every time hold on. Hold on
1247020	1250320	I could see the shame on her face. That was a present from my daughter
1250640	1255660	She gave me a gift receipt in case I didn't want it that gift receipt was to a store called
1256780	1262860	Target, huh? That's it. That's it. It was Target. Hmm. I love shopping in Target for all my holiday needs
1262860	1269040	I I got you and back such wonderful presents two individuals walk through the doors
1269580	1276800	Are they revolving doors into the can station? Why not? I can't yeah, of course feels like they are the old west saloon doors
1277260	1279260	one of these individuals
1282340	1284340	The can piano players
1284340	1286340	I
1289660	1296420	Immediately slumps over two individuals walk through the front door of the can station one is tall
1297280	1301740	Mousey is wearing glasses and the other one is short jacked and bald
1301900	1306420	They walk forward scoping out one takes the left side one takes the right side
1306420	1313180	They're looking through the windows on either side. They see the editing Bay you follow them they head into the editing Bay
1313500	1316620	Ray-ray, you remember every face that's coming in out of here, don't you?
1319140	1324940	We can zoom enhance zoom and enhance we zoom in enhance you can do that on boring security cameras
1325460	1326660	We pull back
1326660	1333060	we zoom out to see these two as they walk in once again and zoom in on their faces and
1333460	1335460	Something it's weird. It's like
1336060	1341380	Something that they're wearing maybe seems to be obvious skating their face
1341380	1346660	It's like it's too well lit like pauperizing around their shirt paparazzi clothes
1348180	1353900	Paparazzi stuffs like the anti-paparazzi shirts. Can I roll to see if Julius would like associate that with?
1354580	1357860	Fuck, what is the bet? Well, who are the bad guys bad guys?

1372280	1374280	I mean, uh, well Sharon I spent
1374800	1380600	Several weeks together in the in the mid 80s and and she employed a similar device against the paparazzo
1380600	1383560	I bet you wish you could turn back time, dude
1384400	1388600	I'm sorry. What you know like never mind mamma Mia

1408880	1410200	Ray Ray
1410200	1411600	It's it's hard to see their faces
1411600	1416680	But it's like they're wearing some sort of mask have you have you ever seen anything like this or seen them before? Oh
1417120	1422560	I heard about it on the internet. I heard about what on the internet. It's kind of like clothes
1423480	1426840	That okay. Yes. I mean, I'm familiar. What would you google?
1427560	1428960	anti
1428960	1430300	face
1430300	1433140	Camera, can you zoom into the car that they arrived in?
1434680	1436680	Anti face camera
1438200	1439320	Shirt
1439320	1441520	Go ahead and zoom into the car that they came in
1441520	1448880	He whips around with the digital analog knob and shows that they head into the editing bay
1448880	1450760	They're in there for a couple minutes
1450760	1456840	They leave the editing bay just the two of them as they're walking out one does a classic like
1457400	1462520	Flicks the thumb drive in the air off their thumb. It makes a noise. Oh
1464440	1465480	And
1465480	1467440	Catches it throws it back in the pocket
1467440	1475340	they head back out to their police car the external camera on the building looks out and you see that this is
1476040	1479180	CPD number eight three six. Oh, come on
1483480	1488200	Is it TC I read the spoilers discord
1492280	1494280	I should have asked you what number it was
1496480	1498480	Is it a
1501840	1509240	Is it a city police car or contingent police car ooh interesting question, I don't know what contingent is this is season two
1509240	1514920	It's a city police car. We need to find out who that police car is registered to which which officers
1516240	1518720	How do you even do that Beck can do that?
1518720	1523840	I mean I can I can sort of do that but like I'm not a reporter like
1524040	1528440	It seems like you guys would know more about how to like investigate things
1528440	1533120	Is there another way you could figure out like a way to follow them? What's that?
1536120	1542160	I know that that the the Bori security company runs almost all the security around here
1542160	1546480	Maybe if we call one of the higher-ups we can get access to the buildings around us
1546480	1549880	I have a couple of trusted contacts in the city police force
1549880	1553600	They might be able to look these badge numbers up for me this car number
1553600	1553920	Yeah
1553920	1557840	I think that'd be the way to go just like see if they have like who was driving the car
1558000	1561260	Just like that alone would get us on the right track sick. Yeah
1561260	1566640	Let's go to the giant phone in the can offices the red phone that goes straight to the police. Yeah
1568600	1570600	No, no, that's that's
1570800	1576000	Too obvious my contacts in the CPD prefer me to contact them more discreetly
1577000	1583960	Is it like a like a secret drop situation are we doing like by stuff yes, it's very cool. Oh shit
1583960	1589160	Yeah, it's very fun. I mean, it's not so like we do talk face-to-face, but there is an elaborate and
1589800	1594240	Fairly pointless system of message drops and exchanges before that process can begin
1594240	1600560	Are we gonna like put an X on a window Julius is googling the Bori security company hotline?
1602800	1604680	Everyone roll on
1604720	1606720	Intelligence or
1609360	1613200	Bureaucracy 18 on the 75 I pass an intelligence role
1615760	1617760	Yeah, they're ring
1618720	1624000	System I'll try to do that again at Target God I went to Target the other day
1626640	1630840	Classic thing where you go in for one thing and the deals are so hot you end up just
1631200	1633320	You get your whole week's worth of stuff
1634040	1638840	That they have at the front. I just like one dollar two dollars three dollars five
1639040	1643760	Yeah, and I know before Thanksgiving. I bought a stuffed felt turkey there
1643800	1647960	I'm gonna go back to Target and try to find myself a reindeer in that little front section
1647960	1652680	Do you think maybe stop by this? Maybe stop by the Starbucks that's always at the front of the target
1652680	1655940	I kind of feel like everything in that front section has been felt. This is crazy
1656460	1662060	You bought a stuffed turkey I bought a real strict like turkey and they're extensive grocery section Wow
1662660	1668940	Yeah, that is crazy. Well, and I didn't know where I was gonna get a turkey and a ham for Christmas
1669140	1676380	But at Target they have it and you should go to Target if you check on Target's website. They have recipes for holiday meals
1677580	1681420	late lunch time late lunch alert and you see that
1681740	1686900	Thai shitty son Raymond pulls his phone back out of his pocket and he's like
1688940	1691820	Deborah over traffic hit me up for that lunch time
1692320	1697140	Me and Deborah from traffic over here at City Action News are gonna head out to lunch
1697140	1701740	So you guys can have at this but like whatever this feels like an everybody loves Raymond joke
1701740	1703980	But I don't know enough about that show to know if it's accurate
1708220	1710220	What a good show
1710660	1715420	Yeah, I had a real good dog named Murphy he used to sound like he was on everybody loves Raymond
1721060	1728700	I passed my intelligence. So did I yes in me three successes and when Raymond brings up the debt
1728700	1732700	Oh my god. I just got that. I just understood the jerk
1733280	1737080	Raymond and Deborah. Yep. This is this is me. I'm Zach. What's up?
1737760	1744840	It's nuts how brands work it's like two people who are so in some way like have a relationship that sounds good
1749360	1756700	As as Raymond starts talking about having lunch with Deborah from traffic at City Action News you think
1761040	1765980	Julius puts his phone down realizing. I don't want to talk to the boring hotline
1767080	1773620	We can just use the traffic cameras and Cal has already texted his contact. How's the weather?
1776680	1780920	You immediately get a text back this is Beck gets a text it says, how's the weather?
1789520	1794460	It's you don't even have to be old to make a mistake like that like hey, you don't have to be that old
1797080	1799080	Oh
1802320	1809520	Cal it looks like you texted me. It's it's it's fine. The weather's fine. And but I think that this was probably for fuck anyway
1811880	1816120	Yes, yes, yes, he scrolls down like several bees and gets to his contact
1817960	1819960	How's the weather

1974760	1979040	You said the park it was it was you Cal we were following your lead. That's right. He takes a sudden
1980040	1982040	And
1983200	1990480	Through the gates of the city park we see etched no not etched rot in iron
1990480	1992480	I
1998400	2000400	Got tingles
2005840	2012000	Cow cow like sheds a single tear as he passes under the gates and thinks about like the brave like proud working men of
2012000	2014000	the city who rot
2015800	2017120	120 years ago
2017120	2019040	twisted it says
2019040	2021400	The city park. I
2022240	2028440	Love this goddamn city rolling through you see on either side of you trees

2034000	2039600	That's I don't know you see trees must have been planted here must have been 30 of the fuckers
2050040	2054820	Must have been purposely planted here at least a hundred two hundred years ago
2055240	2062320	Massive trees lining the roads on either side as you curve and make your way through this park
2062320	2066480	You see picnic tables. You see ponds you see fountains
2066480	2073960	You see a little boathouse where a dock has paddle boats the happy couples and families
2074560	2075840	and
2075840	2077160	Rangers
2077160	2079720	There's a medical NPC and there's a long
2080240	2085120	Green dawn on either side past the the medical person there
2085120	2086760	That's adjacent to the pond
2086760	2094160	Of course and the big green lawn stretch is up in a hill sort of fashion up to the top
2094160	2100640	where there is a large statue of an old military general on a horse in front of a
2101080	2106680	Massive building with columns in front of it major general means major gentle means
2107240	2109540	major general beans major general
2111240	2114140	And you know for that guy he looks like a cop
2117100	2122800	You see a police officer on a bike in front of you is that our guy no hit him
2123100	2125100	Where
2125960	2132980	Are you meeting your contact probably under the major general being statue where you can also access the docks to one of the
2133400	2135080	myriad ponds
2135080	2141680	And there's there's some like duck boats that you can paddle as you pass the police officer that's on a bicycle
2141680	2148980	He gives you a kind of stink eye as you head into the the double lanes you as you pass the bicycle
2148980	2153940	It's the appropriate way to pass someone on a bicycle mind you but he gets a kind of hair
2154380	2159500	Tingles up on the back of his neck and then decides. I don't really want to do anything right now
2160100	2165020	Cal is cows in a you know cows in an odd mood these past few days
2165020	2171380	But he chuckles and he says don't worry boys. We're off to meet that those bosses boss damn Cal
2172260	2174260	That's only two rings up
2179780	2181780	Guys still makes coffee
2183140	2186580	Julius through the speaker on the roof of the car just says oops
2188780	2190500	Sorry
2190500	2196420	Yeah, I didn't take into account the siren on the top of your car. Did I know that guy was an idiot
2197140	2203400	Let's go meet our man. Let's go meet this man as you approach the statue at the top of this hill
2203760	2207760	There's like a circle drive around it and Cal pulls the Mercedes over
2207960	2212480	He kind of looks over it back in the passenger seat looks it was starting to get the camera out
2212600	2215860	looks at Julius and the in the back and he says um
2216660	2223880	Unfortunately, there's only room for two on the on the goose paddle boats, but could you follow discreetly behind me?
2224080	2228080	Yeah, hey Cal is it cool if I mic you up very cool back
2229080	2233440	Also, give me one of your tik-tok phones and I could
2235200	2238800	Hide it in my pocket square and and lean towards
2239240	2241240	Julius gives him his tik-tok phone
2241560	2247880	And Julius is stoked because he knows that he can paddle the shit out of these boats with his fucking huge legs
2252080	2257740	Discreetly but you could pull alongside us at some distance and zoom in. Oh, yeah with the audio
2258200	2261280	You're mostly gonna be going in circles though from what I can hear from
2264400	2266560	Julius is gonna sit in the middle and paddle both
2269680	2273380	That way back can straddling like the goose's neck
2280200	2286760	Hey Cal I can you know, I can splash you if you want no, no, no, don't get too close. He'll know something is up
2286800	2287960	Okay, okay
2287960	2290920	Should we go first that would be best if you go before us?
2290920	2296280	You could we'll get a good we'll get a good spot your pace and advantage you behind that's much easier than trying to I'll get
2296280	2300180	A lot of footage of like the trees and stuff. So it looks like we're just tourists making making videos
2300200	2303520	They do call you the b-roll bastard. I
2304940	2311000	Was hoping that was gonna catch on fuck. Yeah. Oh, did you start that back? Yeah, that's a good one. It's working
2311000	2314960	It's yeah, I heard it from like I heard it from a couple people. Oh, yeah
2315520	2322800	That doesn't usually work great job back as you're buying the admission tickets to hop on Julie you think about curious cow
2324200	2328600	Curious cow I like it. That sounds a little weird
2332400	2338480	Don't spread that one I'll think on it Julius flashes his season pass which allows a guest
2338480	2340480	We
2343200	2346440	Have your boat waiting for you right here, mr. Summers it
2348240	2353120	It's a goose with sunglasses on and on the side it's gilded it says summers
2361240	2364920	Which it I turn on to work against my legs and this is my
2368480	2370480	I

2386920	2394440	Yeah, man. Do you like do this a lot as he pulls up the Julius just slaps his thighs and kind of like duh
2399480	2402760	So I'm thinking it's just protein it's a
2403320	2407200	Like one of those like muscle powder like shaker things
2407920	2412920	And then like a charcuterie board, but it's mostly it's like two full summer sausages
2417760	2419760	Plus like four ounces of vodka
2421800	2425800	Like a big Slim Jim just snaps into
2425800	2427800	One of the summer sausages
2427960	2434620	Beck you better hold on. Yeah. Oh, yeah, and I'm kind of I'm doing what we said just kind of holding on for dear life
2436360	2438360	Getting into a good angle
2438960	2440960	and
2442520	2447080	Julius flips the motor in reverse and starts pedaling forward quickly
2447080	2449080	And
2451500	2455840	You guys make your way out into the middle of this pond
2455960	2464080	He's like make it like creating like a wake making you awake out to yeah, like it's like bouncing. It's bouncing the other
2464840	2466840	bird

2473520	2478640	Cal is approaching his contact who is in like a classic kind of trench coat

2484520	2486520	And we've got we've got our headphones
2491960	2497440	Doesn't zoom just like goes to the focus of like the very obvious boat with these two with their boom
2497440	2501320	I say to Julius I didn't set up a way for us to communicate with him
2501640	2503640	Julius gives a big thumbs up
2511120	2513460	That's funny for a minute and he turns around
2517800	2525240	He gives you a big thumbs up too and approaches police chief McMillan Oh police chief McMillan who is a
2526040	2527000	Broad-shouldered
2527000	2530400	gentleman with a big ol walrus
2530980	2537140	Mustache that is gray and salt and pepper. What's his head look like shiny? Yeah
2537280	2541520	Yeah, very shiny since he's got a walrus stash. He has to be bald
2547000	2553480	Haircut and a walrus mustache looks strange. Yeah, he's got he's got these crazy like schoolboy locks
2555600	2560760	Like fifties, yeah, but his but his mustache is is is more gray than red
2560760	2564360	But it still twitches weirdly like a walruses almost like whiskers
2564880	2569660	Mr. Colorado was a pleasure back. I can see that guy sweating from over here
2571880	2573880	Mac are you okay?
2576480	2581060	What I don't get out on the boat, oh, yes, I definitely agree
2581820	2585580	By the way, this is a two-party consent state, so I
2587700	2592420	Just need to tell you this conversation is being recorded is this normal for the two of you
2592420	2593540	This is abnormal
2593540	2595060	but in real life
2595060	2600460	It might not be abnormal if you just always guaranteed him that he was on what I think it's called deep cover or deep background
2600460	2603560	That they on background on background. Is that what it is? Can't be quoted
2604300	2608700	Background is but you are deep back your deep background. You can't be quoted in
2609100	2612540	It like is very meaningful hello, mr. X
2613620	2617340	You're on deep background. Oh, then I can use this voice
2620500	2622980	It's hard easier to understand for sure, please
2623700	2628220	Just for the sake of journalistic integrity. Could you please speak as clearly as possible?
2628420	2632380	So there's no issue with the with the transcription. Yes, of course
2633120	2635120	Thank you
2635840	2639560	That was as best as I could do that was very good for me
2649520	2651520	Back I think this guy's having a stroke
2653680	2659360	He keeps shaking his head as he talks, I think that might be the issue sweat is just flying off of him
2660360	2668160	I'm very nervous cow Mac. You're my best source. I need to know about two of your officers. He
2669280	2676000	Walks, he looks at you with that big mustache. He walks off the side of the goose boat that we're battling
2677600	2679600	We've got a goose but not a swan boat
2681480	2683480	It's a little uglier
2684600	2687200	Ours has sunglasses on so it's inconspicuous
2689360	2691360	On the eyes
2693120	2699680	Let's damn got always button to us that's that's what I want to know or do you do you have reason to believe and it?
2699680	2703600	Seems that you do that. Some of your rank are perhaps compromised by the gaudel Corp
2706600	2708600	Never come percentage about
2719800	2721800	I've never
2732680	2734680	Mocking you
2736240	2742160	Speak clearly man, you know, I know your father got you this job, but it's time to show some spine
2742840	2744840	City is in danger
2745360	2748880	Persuader bureaucracy or laws is a 20 year old kid
2756720	2758720	Have no fucking clue where my dice is
2759560	2764800	While you're rolling Julius you receive a text from tife Rayland your uncle and it reads
2765760	2767760	Need to see you in my office
2768520	2772940	Bring Beck and cow. What was I rolling? You are rolling on law
2773540	2775340	Bureaucracy or
2775340	2779540	Persuade I win them all with a 29. I win the mice
2780860	2787180	Julius doesn't respond right now. Well, you say that's just a type of the God all company is
2788180	2792220	When that's where me 10 films all through the city police department
2792820	2797220	And it's hard to know who you can trust anymore. Who's a real cop and who's a cop?
2797260	2799940	What percentage roughly would you say are cops?
2800940	2802940	Mm-hmm
2803260	2807460	Unfortunately, it's hard to tell these days, but I say it's somewhere between
2809140	2810740	15 and
2810740	2813460	25% this thick is a poison is poison
2813460	2820060	That's going like a virus not poison unless a poison cause a poison that grows maybe a
2820900	2822900	poison that grows
2823500	2828040	Mac you may have just given us the name of the segment that wins the next Peabody
2828120	2833760	Bob what's all in the name to get it all out and make sure that the good people of the city are being taken care
2833760	2839360	Of and being watched over whether it's by the funny police department or the city. I can news or whatever goes out
2845640	2849240	Beck turns to Julius. I'm just getting plosives dude. It's all
2858040	2860040	a
2860320	2862320	Make sure you're getting the spit flying
2867080	2870080	Becca zoomed in on the lips to try to better understand him
2872960	2874960	I'm already there
2879040	2882240	Back I can feel the water level of this pond raising just
2889040	2891840	Mac that's what I'm trying to use the dire straight
2891840	2896000	I have known you since you were just a beat cop and I was a beat reporter
2896800	2900800	We would get drinks at suds and buds the bus sides of buds
2900800	2905600	I have they were the best suds of buds could have and you were my best, but
2906440	2908440	Do you remember those days Mac?
2910520	2912520	Well, of course I go
2912520	2914520	I
2914680	2920120	It's amazing, I feel like my voice has grown deeper or more
2921680	2923680	Distinguished
2925360	2930800	Except for the gray in your beard Mac. I'd swear you had an age today
2936800	2939440	Julius is giving back the craziest look
2940440	2942440	He's returning it
2943840	2947560	My father was a Mac his father was a Mac his father father
2948680	2951560	I'm a Mac. Oh, this is where we see he has like
2952200	2954200	Fishman gills
2955360	2960220	Okay, I'm laughing too hard. Yeah, this is nuts. Let's get to the let's get to the point here
2960220	2964840	I mean you just keep doing it for a little bit. Well, I don't remember what that is
2966000	2968000	You can break that what to do
2969440	2971440	Hold on
2982120	2987760	You're right Mac we should get to the point I pass him like a little sheet of paper that has the the
2988320	2996400	CPD 836 license plate on it and I say two of your officers were spotted entering the can offices last night and
2996840	2999480	Leaving with the biggest story of my career
2999480	3003400	I was hoping you could tell me who they were and where they might have gone
3003680	3007640	But I do think there are certainly one of those 15% that are
3008040	3010240	Gops, not cops role
3010880	3012880	law or bureaucracy
3013920	3016540	17 big ol pass yo
3017880	3022780	He's like basic platelet and he pulls out his phone cop that
3026840	3029580	What is your query I am
3031480	3035840	6c PD 8 3 6 8 2 6
3046320	3051600	Hold up two fingers to Thomas like okay, there's two people
3051600	3053600	It's
3054240	3056240	826 say 3 6
3057880	3065840	CPD 8 3 6 2 officers assigned to vehicle officers Richard Riley and
3066520	3068920	Wilson Wiley, well, why do you have it?
3068920	3074520	Which are violent and was compiled they show officers. What did they do? They stole the biggest news story since 9-eleven
3075360	3076760	Whoa
3076760	3082040	What do Karen to go into any details place? Tell me anything that won't get me into too much trouble
3082040	3085200	I yearn to learn you should have been a journalist my friend
3085200	3088080	I tried to get you to go into J school when we were roommates
3090080	3092080	Like it was yesterday
3092120	3095320	See me those dawn looking over a single tear trust
3096160	3100320	Cal's face. I know exactly what you mean Julius is once
3101040	3103040	once again looking it back like
3103720	3105720	You know what
3105960	3108040	We've got a boom hour like organically
3109920	3115800	If he's like vaguely, uh, like a nautical creature, right? He's a walrus in my head
3117960	3124440	Mac I can't thank you enough for this information. I know I did with some give me a little tease, baby. Oh
3124440	3126440	Oh
3132280	3136320	Mac you know, I can't do that. Hey, also, maybe next time just text me
3145560	3148040	I'll get a burner. It'll be easier
3148840	3155720	But you know these swan boats tire out my legs I you look down and he's just got calves for dogs
3155920	3161440	He's got the calves that like Julius Summers wishes he had with his thighs. Oh, yeah
3162520	3164620	We have just been going around in circles
3167360	3169360	The can boat circles
3171360	3175400	While Julius is like looking at back just dumbfounded
3175400	3182240	He is kind of not paying enough attention and goes right by them like a foot away
3182640	3184640	What is the back to shore?
3185000	3187000	Cal just like glares at you
3188040	3190040	Like Tanya and Porsche
3190240	3192240	My Tanya Porsche

3198720	3201360	Also kind of people will be catching up then over the holidays
3201400	3206280	And I thought it would be funny if we like just tease Joe about the things he hasn't seen watch it
3206280	3208280	I don't think that'd be funny
3211200	3214760	You guys parked the swan back at the dock and
3215600	3222240	Hop on out and he immediately goes to the person who's working there that the young person behind the counter
3222240	3224240	Thank you so much for an excellent
3226040	3227600	And heads up
3227600	3234600	For a what experience max on excellent got it Cal didn't catch that but he does tip the kid like 80 bucks
3239800	3245760	Julius finishes up his summer sausages and hops onto the deck and
3246280	3251320	Is just like stoked at what he just experienced but also very confused
3251360	3258120	Yeah, Cal Cal is waving goodbye to Mac as he gets like he walks back to the parking lot and he he turns around and
3258200	3260940	Runs up to you guys and is like well you heard the man

3285260	3287260	dude plosives plosives
3288380	3290380	Plosives that is a fun word
3291180	3296100	No, I don't know what it means. It's just the audio wasn't great, but I think we got most of it
3297820	3303620	Okay, I mean I you know, that's really your department back so that's a little disappointing to hear
3303820	3309420	Did you remember what the names the cop net said Richard Riley Wilson Wiley
3309820	3312340	Julius is gonna start googling those names. Oh
3313940	3319960	You're gonna be able to find some social media pages some would cops have LinkedIn
3321140	3323540	No cops have problematic Facebook's
3324740	3332160	Like no Instagram like no look at the groups. They're in so Julius is Julius finds a blue lives matter
3332760	3338120	Banner yep sticker thing with a frame. That is the Punisher. Yes
3339560	3346360	50 Wilson Wiley's yeah, but most of them are like, okay a third of them are the same like happy dad
3346360	3349880	He's like recreated all the photos like all the profiles
3351660	3353660	Every time we forgot his login
3355600	3357600	And then there's that one
3357640	3364000	Yeah, you scroll down through a bunch and you get to the the Punisher and the the blue lives matter Julius knows that this
3364000	3369540	Is who he's looking for? Oh, man, look look who's there in his featured photos. It's Richard Riley
3369540	3373220	Do they look like the guys I saw on the security ad so
3373740	3379280	Lutely and the the one that is tall mousy and wears glasses is
3380460	3384620	Wilson that is right. It's Wilson Wiley and the short jacked and bald one
3384940	3391500	That's Richard Riley Richard Riley shout out to Cameron from Kansas City for
3392360	3399340	Wilson Wiley one of our $10 patreon patrons. Hold on. Hold on Kansas City, Kansas or Kansas City, Missouri
3399340	3401940	It just says Cameron from Kansas City
3402900	3406740	Well, then I guess we'll see Cameron one has to assume, Missouri
3406740	3408740	You
3416100	3418100	Now a target
3419540	3425220	You guys are standing in the middle of City Park we were looking at the Facebook you were looking through the Facebook
3425220	3432460	I want to see if he's posted his like posted a status like with his his location accidentally on that's it
3432460	3439940	Just says an address of like maybe a house. He lives in interesting or like his militia meetup. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead and real search
3442320	3448460	57 on a 70. Yeah, absolutely one of the most recent photos that has been snapped is
3448980	3456260	Actually of him and of Wilson it is of both Richard and Wilson together peeking behind a fence over a fence
3458180	3460180	They are peeking over a fence
3460580	3463800	It does have the geotech locked on there
3471100	3477780	And it is a location that is in the city in the warehouse district look nice
3480460	3485580	Dude does one of you live in the browser that seems like a cool place Julius might live
3485740	3492340	He is renting a house in the center place, of course, we know what kind of neighborhood the warehouse district is. Oh, yeah
3492340	3494340	Yeah, it's actually it's down by
3494740	3497780	It's down by the docks. It's like the warehouse district
3498300	3503660	Which is like specifically that's yes, but is it cool or is it not it depends on who you are
3503660	3507460	I suppose for someone like you it might not be cool for someone who is
3507900	3514860	Maybe Beck speed but ten years speedier might be cool. I mean younger or older
3514860	3519060	I think it means young it's cool. Yeah, it could be cool. It's up-and-coming cool
3519060	3524340	I mean clearly these guys aren't hanging out at a cool place guys. I I I think I went to a
3524940	3528220	Show in a warehouse around this area in college
3529060	3531060	Which was not that long ago
3531060	3533060	I
3535660	3537660	Been doing like a bar
3543540	3546700	Wait, seriously, you two are you want to go to the warehouse district?
3546700	3552340	I mean, that's it's where the guys are. I did a lot of reporting in the warehouse district in the 80s
3552340	3559220	It's it's actually a kind of a up-and-coming spot. There's a restaurant there called the black widow
3560220	3562220	Interesting, it's all eggs
3562980	3566900	Spider egg shaped foods. It's where a cool young person might live
3566900	3572740	It's kind of like two blocks where you would actually live and then the rest is, you know less up-and-coming
3573260	3577180	Exciting but this is definitely right off one block over from where it's cool
3577260	3584100	Well, let's let's go check it out. Joy is to get another text. This just says ETA. Oh fuck guys. I forgot
