0	7600	Hot damn, y'all. I just heard cheesecake is a real thing that real human people like to eat.
7600	17000	I didn't know I could get all my favorite kinds of messy, curdled cream all in one solidified circle,
17000	21100	ready to cram all up in my maw.
21100	24900	I hope it's as slimy as I imagined it to be.
24900	28500	It's your dreamy, cheesy daddy Wolf the Dog,
28500	36300	and I am dreaming of that cheesy, sexy good time live from 694.2 PTBP.
36300	45500	We are proud to announce this community has raised $6,502 for the bail project.
45500	50000	And since the bail money goes back to them when cases close,
50000	55200	they're able to recycle every dollar donated at least twice per year.
55200	57900	Go to the link in the show notes to help.
57900	65200	The bail project combats mass incarceration and reshapes the pretrial system in the United States.
65200	70400	Screenshot your donation and email us pretendingpod at gmail.com.
70400	77000	And for every $5 donated, you'll have an entry to win a Pretending to Be People t-shirt.
77000	81700	The third winner in this giveaway will be announced right now.
81700	84600	And that generous listener is...
87600	91400	Congratulations, Joelle. Keep donating, y'all.
91400	96100	There are still two more PTBP shirts left to give away.
96100	98300	I'd love to get one of them shirts,
98300	104900	but every time I put clothes on, they melt into a kind of shirt paste after a few hours.
104900	112100	One time, I made a sweater out of a bunch of hair clippings I found out back behind a dog groomer's place.
112100	117200	And by the time I made it home, it turned into a kind of hair jelly.
117200	122600	Slap that on some toast, throw some paprika on it, and you got a stool going, baby.
122600	129400	Have any thoughts on any of that? Then tag at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram.
129400	132500	Let me know how you really feel.
132500	139100	It's one of the best ways to get the word out about our little show here at 694.2.
139100	141700	And it's free, too.
141700	149600	What's not free is that sweet, sweet bonus content over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.
149600	154500	But it's worth it. I'm worth it. And I guess you're worth it, too.
154500	160000	And for those of you in the Dennis Inn, get ready for part three of Lover in the Ice.
160000	171000	Streaming live into your room, workplace, or fancy toilet setup on Tuesday, June 23rd at 7 p.m. Central time.
171000	177600	My producer says the edited audio of part two will be up before Monday is complete.
177600	185400	And that episode will be available to all patrons at the Splashylvania Fastpass holder tier and up.
185400	188700	But Wolfie knows money is evil.
188700	196900	So if you can't swing the expense, write up a five star review on Apple Podcasts and I might read it on air.
196900	201300	Like this one here from Macha505 who writes,
201300	204900	I'm super impressed with the quality of this podcast.
204900	208700	All the role players are imaginative and committed.
208700	214100	And the DM is an incredible story creator and storyteller.
214100	219100	My husband and I listen to this weekly. Definitely recommend.
219100	222200	Well, that's so nice of you to say, Macha.
222200	228800	One day when I understand the merits of modern technology, I hope I can listen to the podcast.
228800	234500	For now, I just got to take y'all's word for it and blindly throw my support behind it.
234500	239300	Slap my ass and call me by my preferred nomenclature.
239300	246400	It's the news after escaping the growing but leisurely ooze by heading down into the sewer system.
246400	253900	Gary Daley showed the boys an old blog post by Harold Dorsey that had been wiped from the World Wide Web.
253900	263400	Our intrepid adventurers, along with Drew Carey, Tyler and Jimmy Sanders, were led to Harry and Gary's underground hideout.
263400	268500	There, Mildred Mitchell, Tildy B's grandma hid in her tent.
268500	277000	Casey Kristoff, the longtime janitor at the First Church of Contention, listened in while feigning interest in his book.
277000	282900	And Clara Blankenship, a dream-obsessed archivist with a familiar tattoo,
282900	290300	showed them a vlog from the previously missing John Peters that had also been pulled from the interwebs.
290300	299000	Catch these hands, my babies, and feel the fire of kudzu with no backbone.
320300	337800	My mom just sent me a meme that says, breaking news, John Travolta was hospitalized for suspected COVID-19.
337800	345800	But doctors now confirm that it was only Saturday Night Fever.
345800	351300	And they assure everyone that he is staying alive.
351300	359300	Apparently, he had chills that were multiplying.
359300	364800	It's a good thing the angel Michael didn't come for him.
364800	368300	Grease.
368300	371300	It would have been a heck of a phenomenon.
371300	374300	Oh, that's good.
374300	380800	Everybody wants world peace, but it really seems that we've got a real battlefield here on Earth.
380800	385300	Yeah, we're heading toward a face-off.
385300	397300	The other day on TV, have you heard about the wild hogs in Missouri?
397300	399800	Them and farmers are having a real face-off.
399800	400800	I already used face-off.
400800	402800	Oh, shit.
402800	408800	I got a postcard from my aunt from Paris with love.
408800	412300	Have you ever eaten at Hemingway's up at Bass Pro?
412300	414300	On the wall, they've got a big swordfish.
414300	415800	Oh, wow.
415800	420800	Hey, good one.
420800	424800	I couldn't relate it to his COVID diagnosis, but it worked.
424800	426300	Yeah, that's really hard.
426300	435300	They said while he was in the hospital, he had to get somebody to take care of his old dogs.
435300	437300	Oh, wow.
437300	440300	Isn't it old hogs? Wild hogs?
440300	442300	He's in old dogs and wild hogs.
442300	445300	He's in both. Oh, no.
445300	453300	He didn't look the way he wanted to because they wouldn't allow him in the hospital to use his hairspray.
453300	455300	Oh, yeah.
455300	461300	They had to put him in a special bed because he was too tall because he couldn't get shorty.
461300	463300	Gotti.
463300	464300	Gotti.
464300	466300	Luke's just looking at Wikipedia now.
466300	471300	Oh, look who's talking now. Thomas is back in the room.
471300	474300	Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, and John Lee Pettymore III.
474300	483300	You're in this large underground chamber that Gary Daley led you to in order to hide from Pastor Adam Kane and the First Creek family of contention.
483300	491300	Kerry Pages, Drew Andrews' body, is on the ground, cuffed, and nuzzling Tyler, the tireless black lab.
491300	495300	Jimmy Sanders is wandering around the place, murmuring to himself.
495300	501300	Mildred Mitchell is in the tent furthest from you and hasn't popped out since your arrival.
501300	509300	Casey Kristoff, the long-time janitor at the First Church of contention, is leaning up against one of the four concrete columns,
509300	518300	acting like he is reading a book while he listens in on the conversation you've been having with Harry Klinker, Gary Daley, and Clara Blankenship,
518300	523300	who just showed you a video of John Peters from a few years ago.
523300	526300	A video that was scrubbed from the internet.
526300	531300	A video wherein he talks about the dreams he had during his coma.
531300	534300	Clara puts down her phone and looks to you all.
534300	539300	What does a Nike bag have to do with another world and a man who can burn persons with his hands?
539300	544300	I might know a feller who, uh, who, who can shake your hand and make it burn.
544300	548300	Uh, that's, that's my, that's my uncle, uh, Don D. Pettymore.
548300	549300	What?
549300	552300	That, that's, yeah, that's my, my uncle can do that.
552300	554300	Probably lots of other people.
554300	561300	He mostly did it as like a party trick, but sometimes, you know, if he got a little too drunk or if he really didn't like a feller, he'd burn them pretty good.
561300	569300	But like also he'd, he'd, he'd stick it in your mittens when we were kids on a cold day and, and he'd warm you up.
569300	576300	So we always took it as like, you know, it wasn't, I didn't think of it as anything sinister.
578300	580300	You know, he did call it devil hands.
585300	589300	But it, you know, it warmed, it warmed my little bones up, so.
589300	594300	Did he, did he ever tell you why he thought he could do it? Like that's not something most people can do, John.
594300	598300	I mean, I guess it just became part of your world as a kid, but it's kind of weird.
598300	605300	I never, I never asked, you know, cause yeah, it's just, since I was born, Uncle Don could do that.
605300	606300	Where, where is he now?
606300	615300	Well, uh, I can, you know, that's, I actually kind of come, uh, come into law enforcement because of, because of him.
615300	625300	And you know, now, as I say, I'm about to say this next thing, uh, it does make the devil's hand sound a lot more sinister, but he's, he's really involved in some, in some nasty business.
625300	630300	And, uh, he put up a lot of money for my race and career when I was a younger man.
630300	638300	And, uh, I kinda, I kinda, I kinda biffed that, uh, a little bit and ended up owing him a lot of money.
638300	641300	And I thought maybe the safest place for me to be was in a uniform.
641300	646300	To avoid him, you mean? To keep you safe from, like, loan sharks?
646300	651300	Yeah, uh, yeah. And devil hands.
651300	652300	And devil hands, right.
652300	656300	So what would he have been doing with a Nike bag? With the Nike bag?
656300	662300	This, this devil hands uncle of yours, when was the last time you saw him?
662300	668300	Uh, you know, a few, a few years ago, he did the old devil hands on, on Large Eddie.
668300	672300	Large, Largette, he, he burned, he burned somebody. Did it kill him?
672300	676300	No, no, no. He just, you know, toasted his fingers a little bit.
676300	683300	Claire, you said you've been seeing the, have you, have you seen a person who can burn hands in your, in your visions of this rope?
683300	685300	You've been seeing the rope figure though, right?
685300	690300	Yeah. Yeah. The rope figure, which like, Keith, you've been really quiet for the past like 10 minutes.
690300	695300	Maybe it's just cause Luke's internet dropped last time, but have you seen any of these?
695300	698300	I mean, we were talking the rope figure, we were talking these long...
698300	705300	Before, before Keith says anything, I do also seem to, and I'm just kicking myself for just thinking of this now,
705300	712300	but speaking of the fellows that were chasing the rope figure, come to think of it, last time I saw Uncle Don,
712300	720300	uh, two of them, those weird, tall, lanky, translucent figures, they was chasing us for a while.
720300	727300	I took quite a severe head injury, uh, the last time I saw Uncle Don, so a lot of the details are fuzzy.
727300	734300	Did you, you felt, you felt like this, the, the, the translucent guys wearing suits that they were chasing you in particular?
734300	742300	Well, they were chasing, I see, I was being wheeled in a wheelchair by Uncle Don at the time and he, we took off in flight.
742300	745300	I didn't really have much say in the matter.
745300	752300	They were after him or me or someone running directly in front of us, maybe we were running parallel to the people they were chasing
752300	758300	and we were just running for no reason, but now that I've seen them again, that doesn't seem like a very likely explanation.
758300	766300	You know, I must have had repressed memories or something, but you know, when we were messing around with this and I pulled the watch out of my pocket.
766300	768300	Oh, I put it on.
768300	775300	Alright, uh, uh, Luke and Joe, take your headphones off.
775300	776300	Okay.
776300	798300	John, the channel on your reality begins changing as expected and then it stops and you're looking at the kitchen of your childhood home.
798300	806300	Your daddy, John Lee Pettymore III, younger than you ever remember seeing him, is pacing back and forth anxiously.
806300	816300	His face turns hopeful as your mother enters the room, but she slowly shakes her head no as tears begin pouring down her face.
816300	830300	Her husband rushes to embrace his shaking wife, her body convulsing rhythmically to the sobs as a negative pregnancy test falls from her grasp onto the cold tile floor.
830300	844300	The channel changes. You see your daddy again, eyes completely wide and bloodshot, knuckles white as he grips the steering wheel of his black 1977 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am.
844300	854300	Backlit by a home completely engulfed in flames, he looks into the rearview mirror to make sure he isn't being followed.
854300	865300	He speaks into a large car phone. The vector adopted by the Kane family has been eliminated. Casualties, unfortunately, include the rest of the family.
865300	879300	You see a Fincher-esque aerial shot of this entire scene begin to slowly zoom in on the fire and there's a young boy crawling out from this completely consumed building.
879300	892300	He has a balloon-shaped head and eyes so dark that the irises look black. Your view shifts back onto John's black muscle car driving into the night.
892300	904300	And the camera does that cool thing where it moves into the trunk and there you see a baby swaddled in a black suit jacket sitting on top of adoption papers.
905300	913300	Holy shit. Can I get an audio reaction that matches what your face just looked like?
913300	918300	He's not a real petty boy. He's a damn Kane.
918300	937300	So the watch falls off John's hand. John just sits on the floor, like almost falls. He's down.
937300	941300	Whoa, whoa, John, John. I'm trying to ease his fall to the ground. John?
941300	943300	You guys are close enough, you can kind of catch him.
943300	944300	Keith, he put it on again.
944300	951300	Yeah, I was about to tell you about the guys, but holy shit. What'd you see?
951300	958300	John's eyes are just wide. He's just repeating, adopted the vector. They adopted the vector.
958300	960300	Adopted the vector.
960300	963300	Roll Sanity. Thomas?
963300	970300	Crit success. Wait, no, no, no, no, no. Sorry. 33 is a crit failure because I don't know.
971300	976300	All right. But at least it's not over my power.
976300	978300	You're going to lose two sanity.
978300	980300	That takes me to my breaking point.
980300	982300	Oh, wonderful. Very appropriate.
982300	987300	Yes, that is absolutely correct. So Luke and Joe, if you guys want to take your headphones off again.
987300	988300	For sure.
988300	994300	You guys should try putting on the watch this episode because he's got some great shit fucking written for that this time.
1000300	1014300	All righty. Thomas, you know the drill. I need you to roll on a D-100 three times and give me the results one at a time.
1014300	1015300	64.
1015300	1023300	All right. 64 is going to be Lottery Mania. An extreme desire to take part in lotteries.
1023300	1024300	23.
1024300	1034300	23 is Cardicoethis. Cardicoethis, which is an uncontrollable compulsion to see maps everywhere. And the last one?
1034300	1035300	97.
1035300	1041300	And a 97 is Trichotillomania. Craving for pulling out own hair.
1041300	1053300	Wow. These all provide some very interesting role playing options. The last one might be too horrific.
1053300	1055300	It would be really gross.
1055300	1058300	Though I do potentially have thousands of arm hairs.
1058300	1060300	And mustache hairs.
1060300	1063300	I think that's the last thing he'd pull out. That's only when it's truly broken.
1063300	1066300	I'm going to go, I think, with Lottery Mania.
1066300	1073300	Okay. An extreme desire to take part in lotteries. And let's go ahead and just throw in gambling into that as a whole.
1073300	1075300	That would open up some more role player opportunities.
1075300	1076300	Exactly.
1076300	1081300	I was just thinking maybe he would try to start his own lottery and really evangelize it.
1081300	1088300	I think within the confines of this game, trying to take bets with people consistently is going to be an easier...
1088300	1092300	Let's do that. Alright. He's a gambling addict.
1092300	1095300	He's a gambling addict out of nowhere.
1095300	1097300	Holy shit, he's gonna come.
1098300	1100300	Hahahaha!
1110300	1118300	John Lee Pettymore the 3rd, as the watch falls off his wrist, he crumples into the ground and Clark Bishop kind of reaches out and takes hold of him.
1118300	1121300	John starts dry heaving. Clark is gonna pat your back.
1121300	1123300	What's that sound like?
1124300	1132300	John? You got something coming up? Alright, get it out.
1135300	1139300	Well anyway, I saw those figures when I was a kid.
1139300	1144300	John turns around on you and he's like, you wanna bet?
1144300	1158300	I mean, yeah. The first time I saw the watch, my dad was giving it to my brother and the alarms were going off at our house and a few of those creatures were, I guess, invading the property.
1158300	1170300	And we got shooed inside and my dad gave that watch to Ferguson and told him that he was gonna be the savior. So I guess that's not true.
1170300	1186300	The savior? Yeah, something like that. He said, when the time comes, the watch would fit him. I wonder if I'm the savior. Maybe it fits me and I put the watch on.
1186300	1191300	Alrighty, Thomas and Joe. Take those headphones off.
1191300	1197300	Listeners, I hope you're ready for Ben's watching episode 2.
1197300	1199300	Part 2.
1199300	1201300	The rebinjanine.
1229300	1246300	You recognize Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, yourself, and John Lee Pettymore III as they approach the bank of Bean's Pond, with John trailing the other two, you and Clark, by a few yards.
1246300	1259300	Focused on searching for something in the water, Clark and Keith fail to see John raise his gun, take a deep breath, and fire two shots, one for each of his partners.
1259300	1282300	He quickly finishes the task with four more bullets before he crouches down beside your bodies. He grabs your wrist and pulls the watch off and slips it over his own wrist, before he begins walking slowly into the frigid water of Bean's Pond.
1282300	1285300	Oh, no.
1289300	1307300	Clark and John, you actually see Keith Vigna's eyes come back to and look at you, and the watch stays on his wrist.
1307300	1309300	John actually vomits.
1309300	1312300	Keith? Keith? Are you with us? Are you with us?
1312300	1314300	Yeah, Keith, roll Sanity.
1314300	1316300	The watch is still on, Keith.
1316300	1318300	Fail, but not over my power.
1318300	1332300	Okay, you just lose one Sanity, and as Keith realizes the watch is still on, he looks directly into the eyes of John Lee Pettymore III, and John, all you see is fear.
1332300	1340300	And Keith, all you see is this ooze coming out of every orifice on John Lee Pettymore III's face.
1340300	1355300	I just saw us die at the pond.
1355300	1370300	John, can you put your gun down and slide it away from you?
1370300	1376300	John puts his hand on his gun. He doesn't draw it, but he puts it on his holster.
1376300	1378300	Hey, whoa, hey, what's going on?
1378300	1393300	And immediately, Clara and Gary and Harry all kind of back up and go and kind of stand nearby Casey Kristoff, who immediately just kind of like fumbles with his book and then steps away and tries to like move behind one of the pillars.
1393300	1395300	What do you want my gun for, Keith?
1395300	1401300	I don't want it. I just, I don't want you to have it right now.
1401300	1403300	Why don't you want him to have his gun, Keith?
1403300	1411300	I like look at both of them, like looking back and forth to him and I walk over to Clark and I whisper something in his ear.
1411300	1413300	Thomas should take his headphones out.
1413300	1414300	He took it out.
1414300	1415300	Oh, he did.
1415300	1428300	Clark, I saw him, us approaching the pond and John, he shot us and he killed us and then he took the watch and he went into the pond.
1428300	1430300	He just shot us out of the blue?
1430300	1437300	He shot each of us in the back and then four more shots to finish us off and then...
1437300	1438300	Oh, God.
1438300	1439300	Yeah.
1439300	1447300	John is just like, this whisper is taking a long time.
1447300	1451300	What'd he tell you, Clark?
1451300	1454300	Come over here and whisper it in my ear.
1454300	1458300	Hey, John, when you put on the watch, what did you see?
1458300	1464300	Well, I saw confirmation that I'm a child of destiny.
1464300	1470300	I suspect perhaps you two are as well, but I know for a fact that I am.
1470300	1472300	What does that mean?
1472300	1474300	That might be a little complicated.
1474300	1478300	Why don't you tell me why all of a sudden you want to disarm me?
1478300	1479300	Hang on, though.
1479300	1485300	If all you saw was being a child of destiny, when you popped out of there, you said adopted the vector.
1485300	1486300	You kept repeating it.
1486300	1487300	What did that mean?
1487300	1493300	Well, as it happens, I am the vector.
1493300	1494300	You adopted yourself?
1494300	1496300	Technically, he did adopt himself.
1496300	1499300	Yeah, technically, I guess I did adopt myself.
1499300	1503300	This body that you see before you, the body of Kevin Lee Pettymore.
1503300	1505300	John is not taking his hand off his gun.
1505300	1510300	The body of Kevin Lee Pettymore, the soul and mind of Kevin Lee Pettymore.
1510300	1515300	See, he was sent to, I guess, kill all the gangs.
1515300	1520300	Don't rightly know why, but they had adopted a little baby.
1520300	1521300	That's me.
1521300	1523300	I was going to be a cane, fellas.
1523300	1529300	But then my daddy burned down their house and little Adam crawled out of it.
1529300	1532300	He thought he'd killed all them canes, but I guess Adam got out.
1532300	1536300	Might be why he's so ornery.
1536300	1548300	Anyway, I saw me, him, taking baby me, I, with him in a little, you know, with adoption papers.
1548300	1553300	And I also saw a little vision of him and my mama trying real hard to have a baby, and they couldn't.
1553300	1555300	So it was on his mind.
1555300	1562300	And it seems like, you know, you kind of, well, you see a baby on the table, you just take it, you know how it is sometimes.
1562300	1563300	The Pettymore way.
1563300	1564300	Free baby.
1564300	1569300	But yeah, what he said over the radio, remember, he was a part of K-Cell.
1569300	1576300	What he was telling somebody is that he had eliminated the vector adopted by the canes.
1576300	1579300	But he didn't. I'm the vector.
1579300	1581300	And he took me in.
1581300	1585300	And maybe you boys is from similar circumstances.
1585300	1588300	Anyway, that's my story, Ergo, child of destiny.
1588300	1590300	Well, Keith saw you kill us.
1590300	1591300	Yeah.
1591300	1593300	Did you deserve it?
1593300	1596300	I don't rightly believe so.
1596300	1599300	You killed us at the pond, and you took the watch.
1599300	1603300	Are you wanting the watch real bad right now, John?
1603300	1610300	Now that you say that, I got to suspect I had a good reason.
1610300	1613300	Keith, why don't you try taking that watch off?
1613300	1614300	Why is it stuck to you?
1614300	1616300	I think I'm going to keep it on.
1617300	1625300	You know, like I said, my dad told Ferguson, when the time comes, it'll fit, you know?
1625300	1627300	Yeah, but he said that about himself.
1627300	1635300	Well, he said it about, well, my dad thought he was going to be the one, the savior, the chosen one, whatever.
1635300	1639300	And he realized it wasn't him, and he thought it was going to be Ferguson.
1639300	1643300	But, you know, he's gone, so I've got it.
1643300	1650300	And he said when the time comes, it'll fit, and it's not falling off me.
1650300	1657300	And if there's any time for it to be the time of and for a savior, I'd say just right about now is the time.
1657300	1662300	But you're, listen, I've been ball. I am the vector.
1662300	1665300	If anybody's going to be a savior around here, it seems like it would probably be me.
1665300	1672300	Well, I mean, I don't know much about this prophecy other than what I overheard my dad telling Ferguson.
1672300	1675300	Damn, watch.
1675300	1680300	And I step back away from him a little bit, and I'm very scared.
1680300	1691300	I get in the middle. Hey, wait, hey, if anybody's saving anybody, it's going to be the overseer, which we're under the assumption I am.
1691300	1695300	Oh, la-di-da, Mr. Overseer. Could you oversee ball?
1695300	1701300	Nothing could oversee ball. It couldn't be contained. It burst gloriously from the roof that tries to constrain it.
1701300	1707300	Guys, hear me out. What if it's all three of us needing to come together?
1707300	1710300	Now is hardly the time. Sex magic.
1710300	1716300	No, no, no. None of us can do it. I surely can't do anything by myself.
1716300	1723300	I've always needed your guys' help, and maybe we're each a piece of a puzzle.
1723300	1727300	Well, now, here's an interesting point. You might be onto something there.
1728300	1737300	He said, the vector adopted by the canes. Now, perhaps grammatically ambiguous, but to me, it implies other vectors.
1737300	1739300	And Gary...
1739300	1742300	Yeah, Gary did that, you know, little witchcraft.
1742300	1748300	He has that spell that was perfect for three of us. If it was any one of us, it was important.
1748300	1750300	Gary, which one of us is the savior?
1750300	1752300	It's probably me.
1753300	1757300	I'm just saying, my seafood fur will change the world.
1757300	1759300	It is pretty damn good, Gary.
1759300	1762300	Ah, yeah. Alright, we gotta give that to you, Gary.
1764300	1770300	Guys, I've been wanting to get to the pond, but I'm not so sure now.
1770300	1774300	You know, every time we try to go somewhere, we really want to go.
1774300	1781300	The mill. The pond. Some unseen forces trying to scare us away from that.
1781300	1786300	You know, maybe this watch is just showing us bullshit. Maybe we should just go to the pond.
1786300	1788300	Clark starts nodding emphatically.
1788300	1793300	Yeah, what if it's showing us bullshit? How do we know any of it's anything to put any stock in?
1793300	1795300	I mean, yeah, it could easily...
1795300	1800300	Well, except for the part where I'm a child of destiny. I felt that in my bones to be true.
1801300	1803300	That's why I think you should give me that watch.
1803300	1808300	I think maybe we ought to go down into the pond, but maybe I'll keep wearing it and maybe you don't...
1808300	1811300	Maybe you're in front instead of behind us.
1811300	1813300	Is that where I was when the vision was behind you?
1813300	1816300	Yeah, you were a little bit behind us shooting us in the back.
1816300	1818300	That would have been the way to do it.
1824300	1829300	Well, Keith, if it'll make you feel better, here.
1830300	1833300	And I draw my gun and I kick it across to him.
1833300	1837300	I pick it up and tuck it into my belt, my waistband.
1837300	1842300	I actually hate this. Could I get that back? Could I feel very naked? Could I have that back?
1842300	1849300	I'm just going to keep a hold of it. Clark can hold it if you want, but I just...
1849300	1851300	Give it to Clark.
1851300	1853300	I hand the gun to Clark.
1853300	1855300	Hey Clark, can I have that gun back?
1855300	1857300	Clark, don't do it.
1857300	1861300	I'm going to hold on to it just as long as we get past the point in his vision.
1861300	1864300	Once we get past the moment in time, things change.
1864300	1870300	Yeah, we'll give it back to you. Once we get to the pond, nobody's behind anybody, we'll give it back to you.
1870300	1872300	As long as you don't shoot us, that is.
1872300	1874300	Gary, do you have any extra guns?
1874300	1876300	Well, it's a contention, ain't it?
1877300	1879300	Okay, could you get me one?
1879300	1881300	Yeah, you know, he's just...
1881300	1886300	Then Harry walks over to his tent and kind of unzips a flat and opens it up.
1886300	1888300	There's a few different choice weapons.
1888300	1893300	I take a little concealed carry pistol, boom, and slip it into my back pocket.
1893300	1900300	Yeah, that one's real nice for keeping it at the bar, you know, people get unruly, they don't even know, they don't see it coming.
1900300	1903300	You kill people at the bar when they get unruly?
1905300	1911300	Oh, that's actually a pellet gun. Let me hand you the one that looks the exact same, that's actually a real gun. Here you go.
1911300	1912300	Thank you.
1912300	1916300	When I see this happen, I'm like, I mean, well, you're definitely walking in front then.
1916300	1921300	I shoot a glance over to Keith. I mean, was he holding that gun and not his gun in your vision?
1921300	1925300	Oh, that's a fantastic question. Let me think real hard, real quick.
1928300	1929300	Zach?
1929300	1931300	Yeah, man, it was his standard issue.
1931300	1937300	No, it was the gun that you have that he gave to us, so it makes me feel a little bit better.
1937300	1939300	I think things are changing then, maybe.
1939300	1942300	You know, the watch is still on, I'm not seeing anything, so.
1942300	1948300	Keith, here's another question. Did you see yourself die or did I just shoot you two?
1948300	1951300	Oh, I would say, you know.
1951300	1952300	Maybe you just needed a winging.
1952300	1956300	I think a total of six shots does the trick, you know.
1956300	1958300	Apparently you shot us after we were down.
1958300	1963300	Yeah, you shot both of us and then you shot us more.
1963300	1967300	Well, that would do the trick, yeah, probably.
1967300	1970300	How about you just don't shoot us?
1970300	1972300	We'll have you walk in front, just in case.
1972300	1975300	We've kind of moved past this real fast, but I just wanted to ask,
1975300	1979300	Keith, do you have any idea where that watch came from, like how it got to your dad?
1979300	1986300	No, I mean, the first time I saw it was that day when me and Fergie were just playing outside
1986300	1993300	and all of a sudden those creatures popped up in our yard and I don't really know what happened to them,
1994300	1997300	but the first time I saw that watch my dad was giving it to Ferguson.
1997300	2003300	Did you or we look at, like, inspect it? It's not engraved or anything, is it?
2003300	2005300	It's just a normal watch looking, right?
2005300	2011300	I mean, yeah, it's just a gold watch. It's real nice, but, you know, it's a pretty normal watch
2011300	2014300	other than it gives you visions and only fits me.
2014300	2020300	It might be waterproof, but we'd have to get to the pond to find out. Wink, wink.
2020300	2023300	I think that's our next course of action, isn't it?
2023300	2027300	Yeah, I mean, I think we can leave Carrie here with these guys.
2027300	2030300	I think, you know, she shouldn't be too much of an issue with Tyler.
2030300	2037300	Real quick, what if you gave me my gun back? I just like my gun. I named him Seth.
2037300	2041300	Yeah, in my vision you were shooting us with Seth.
2041300	2047300	Hear the rest. Hear it out. Hear it out. Hear it out. I'll just stay here.
2047300	2050300	I won't come to the pond. I'll guard Carrie Pages.
2050300	2057300	Thomas, I'm not kidding. I have it written in my notes that the Canes named you Seth.
2057300	2061300	Oh, my God.
2061300	2063300	That's really weird.
2063300	2064300	That's super weird.
2064300	2066300	That's fucking wild.
2066300	2067300	Holy shit.
2067300	2069300	Maybe the gun is actually a kid.
2069300	2072300	What if it's the vector?
2072300	2085300	I mean, do you really? I mean, it's not that I trust you more than this watch, really, but, you know, I'd like you to come along with us.
2085300	2088300	Good things don't typically happen when we split up.
2088300	2091300	What if I trade you this new gun for Seth?
2091300	2092300	Are you going to kill us?
2092300	2096300	The tent on the far side of the room kind of bursts open, or it tries to.
2097300	2101300	Someone's trying to get out, but they didn't unzip the tent flap first.
2101300	2105300	And Mildred Mitchell is like, oh, my goodness.
2105300	2110300	And then finally the zipper comes loose, and she busts out of there, and she looked haggard.
2110300	2113300	She looks terrible. She's normally all done up all night.
2113300	2119300	She still has one rainbow earring on, but the other one's missing, and her hair's all over the place.
2119300	2125300	And she's holding this piece of paper in one hand that she immediately, like, oh, no, and puts it in her back pocket.
2125300	2130300	And then she's holding a picture in her other hand, and she's like, this, this, this, this is the one.
2130300	2134300	I mean, you, you, you all are the reason that she's gone.
2134300	2139300	But I, just now, standing in this tent, it changed. It changed.
2139300	2143300	It was him, and then it, and then it was him.
2143300	2146300	And she points at John. She says, it was him.
2146300	2150300	And then she points at Keith, and she says, it was him.
2150300	2156300	And she shoves this picture in your face, and it is a picture of the founders of contention.
2156300	2165300	And there you see Silas Cole, but it is not the face of the Silas Cole that you remember seeing growing up, who is very handsome.
2165300	2170300	A very good-looking, maybe a ridiculously handsome man.
2170300	2174300	But now, that face is the face of Keith Vigna.
2174300	2177300	What the, what the fuck?
2177300	2180300	You didn't roll sanity for me?
2180300	2182300	I swear, it was, it, it was him?
2182300	2184300	And she points at John Lee Pettymore the third.
2184300	2190300	It was his face right here, where Silas Cole is. It was his face. And then it changed. The picture changed.
2190300	2193300	There was a very handsome face, and then there was Keith's face.
2193300	2197300	No, there was a handsome face, it was back in the day, a long time, a few weeks ago.
2197300	2204300	And then, and then, I mean, even up until a few days ago, and, and then it became Keith, yes, Keith's face.
2204300	2209300	Oh my God, that's who, I knew he looked familiar. Hey, oh my God.
2209300	2212300	And she just kind of like stumbles away.
2212300	2220300	I just don't, I just don't, does anyone have any pot?
2220300	2224300	Oh yeah, I help her out.
2224300	2228300	I pass her, I pass her my one hitter in.
2228300	2232300	That Kevin always has in his tactical gear.
2232300	2236300	Sean just probably had some stashed around town.
2236300	2240300	He's like, oh, I know this part of the underground. How'd you guys do on your sanity checks?
2240300	2241300	I got a three.
2241300	2242300	Oh my God.
2242300	2243300	I got a two.
2243300	2244300	Jesus.
2244300	2245300	I failed, but under my power.
2245300	2252300	Okay, so Clark, you're going to lose one sanity as you start to realize, Thomas and Luke, take your headphones off.
2252300	2260300	Clark realizes in this moment, whoever had the watch on, becomes Silas Cole.
2260300	2266300	I don't know if that's obvious, just listening to how everything's gone down, but in this moment, you know it to be true.
2266300	2270300	Okay.
2270300	2276300	Keith Vigna, Mildred Mitchell hands you the picture that has you in it.
2276300	2281300	And she goes, look, look, see, and she points to this reflection, it's like a window.
2281300	2292300	There's a vague, faint reflection, and in it, you think you can make out the general outline, vague aura of Tildi B. Mitchell.
2292300	2295300	And she's there, and it's your fault.
2295300	2296300	And she points at Clark Bishop.
2296300	2299300	Hey, I didn't shoot the gun. She did.
2299300	2300300	What gun?
2300300	2305300	I mean, she was gone is what I mean. She wasn't in her room.
2305300	2308300	I mean, we could tell her about the gun that sends people to the past, right?
2308300	2319300	Well, we weren't quite sure what it did, but now that we see this picture of Tildi here, after she shot that gun and disappeared, seems like it sends people to the past, so...
2319300	2320300	That checks out.
2320300	2330300	I got a good idea. What if, how about we give Jon his gun back, but we bring Mildred with us, that way the vision can't be true.
2330300	2334300	I'm not going anywhere with you. You all are the reason that she's gone.
2334300	2335300	What if I gave you this gun?
2336300	2340300	Oh, oh, oh, oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, okay, fine. I'll go, yeah, sure.
2340300	2342300	Okay, but first, Keith, you give me my gun back.
2342300	2343300	Clark's got it.
2343300	2344300	Give me Seth.
2344300	2345300	Clark.
2345300	2348300	Clark is real hesitant about it.
2348300	2350300	Put Seth back in his holster.
2350300	2354300	Why are we trying to make more things like Keith's vision instead of less things?
2354300	2355300	Well, Mildred is the less thing.
2355300	2356300	We're bringing Mildred with us.
2356300	2359300	I just feel very uncomfortable. I would just feel a lot better.
2359300	2369300	While he's trying to get the gun from Clark, I want to, I'm looking at the picture, and I want to take the watch off and see if my face is still on Silas Cole's face.
2369300	2370300	Hey, Luke.
2370300	2371300	Yeah?
2371300	2373300	You can't get that watch off your wrist.
2373300	2374300	Oh.
2376300	2378300	Go ahead and roll sanity. Just you.
2378300	2381300	Oh, that's a fail. Let's see if it's over my power.
2382300	2383300	Yep.
2383300	2392300	Go ahead and lose one sanity as you can't get the watch off your wrist.
2392300	2404300	So while he's trying to get the gun back, I'm trying to, like, unclasp the watch, and it won't unclasp, and then I'm trying to, like, move it around on my arm, but it's, like, staying in just, like, one position.
2404300	2415300	And I start freaking out, and I look at the picture, and I look at Mildred, and I just fly at her and tackle her to the ground and trying to start just beating the shit out of her.
2415300	2417300	Do you actually fly?
2417300	2420300	No. I leap at her.
2423300	2427300	Most Delta Green games don't need that disclaimer.
2428300	2434300	I yell, oh, fuck, and throw Jon his gun, and I try to tackle Keith off of Mildred.
2434300	2442300	Okay, let's all roll. Clark, Keith, and Mildred will all roll an armed combat to see how this shakes out.
2444300	2449300	Jon's just got two guns in his hands now, and he's staring wide-eyed. He doesn't really know what to do.
2449300	2452300	Oh, I forgot you were already holding one. Yeah.
2453300	2456300	I was going to give it to Mitchell. She could have shot Keith.
2459300	2464300	I failed. I rolled over. I got an 85 on a 70.
2464300	2467300	Nice. Oh, my goodness gracious.
2467300	2468300	Oh, no.
2468300	2474300	Luke just showed us with his webcam. He rolled an 0-1, and I failed with a 43. Mildred Mitchell's not a fighter.
2474300	2481300	I look up from the picture, lock eyes with her, and tackle her to the ground and just start punching her in the face.
2481300	2484300	I soar over the top of him as I tried to tackle him off of her.
2488300	2491300	Jon's going to try to separate them.
2491300	2495300	You separate them, and Mildred lays unconscious on the ground.
2496300	2503300	I look over at Mildred and look at Jon and then look down at my hands, and I just throw up.
2503300	2509300	And you throw up directly onto this piece of paper that was in the back pocket of Mildred Mitchell.
2509300	2514300	It fell out, and it's on the ground next to her, and you kind of puke on the corner of it.
2514300	2519300	And it is just a piece of paper that she has written on it, and it says,
2522300	2530300	I'm just shaking, and I'm just looking at the piece of paper, and I lay down on my side, and I'm just trying to catch my breath.
2530300	2536300	Clara Blankenship has hidden behind one of the pillars, as has Casey Kristoff.
2536300	2542300	However, Gary and Harry are both standing at their tense edge, guns drawn.
2542300	2550300	Harry has a pistol, and Gary has a semi-automatic rifle, and they are slowly walking toward Keith Vigna,
2550300	2553300	who's on the ground, and they have their weapons pointed.
2553300	2558300	And Gary's like, you stay right there! You stay on the ground! What the fuck?
2558300	2563300	And Harry's like, I've always stuck up for you. I've always stuck up for you, Keith Vigna.
2563300	2566300	You come in here, and you take out Mildred Mitchell like that.
2566300	2569300	I get between them and Keith. They point their weapons at you.
2569300	2573300	I couldn't help it. I didn't mean to do it. It just, what the hell is going on?
2573300	2582300	Hold on. Hold on, everybody. Calm down now. Should Keith have done that? No. Obviously, Keith.
2582300	2584300	I turn around, and I give you a glare.
2584300	2586300	Weapons down. Weapons down. Everyone. Everyone.
2586300	2591300	They're down. They're down. I put Seth in his holster, and I pocket the other gun.
2591300	2597300	I had a dream that if the temperature gets too high, we all die here. Okay?
2597300	2601300	That was my dream. Claire's over there talking about dreams like,
2601300	2607300	my dream was if the temperature got too high, that we were all gonna die down here.
2607300	2613300	Yet, the dream seemed to be like, maybe metaphorical in places. You ever think about that?
2613300	2614300	About your dreams? No, no.
2614300	2617300	I mean, everybody's dream is different, so what the fuck?
2617300	2620300	Now you're questioning about temperature. Okay, okay. We just gotta all calm down, okay?
2620300	2625300	I'm just trying to understand your meaning. You'd all die if tempers got heated down here,
2625300	2629300	or if the temperature itself got too high. Jesus fucking Christ, John.
2629300	2632300	Yeah, I was saying if our tempers got too high, we were all gonna die.
2632300	2639300	You, Clark, Keith, me, Gary, Mildred, Clara, Casey, all of us.
2639300	2646300	While they're talking, I am slowly, like, scooting towards a tunnel.
2646300	2650300	I mean, you can slowly back away. You're far ways away from one of the tunnels.
2650300	2653300	This is a pretty big room. Yeah, I'm doing that still, though.
2653300	2657300	And I'm looking at everybody. Clark is gonna start getting back to his feet.
2657300	2664300	Harry, I'm sorry. I understand that was alarming. We've all become touchy in the last few days.
2664300	2669300	Things set us off, and it's not good, I understand, but look at him now. Look at him now.
2669300	2672300	He's scared. He doesn't even know what just happened. I guarantee it.
2672300	2674300	He's just worming his little way away.
2674300	2679300	Y'all need to get the fuck out of here. We protected you for long enough. You need to get going.
2679300	2681300	If you're gonna go to the pond, go to the fucking pond.
2681300	2686300	Well, now, hold on. Everyone's sitting around here having visions.
2686300	2688300	Go to the fucking pond.
2688300	2690300	Listen, magic man, we've got some fucking questions.
2690300	2692300	I get up and take off towards the tunnel.
2692300	2693300	John, I think we should go.
2693300	2695300	Harry, is this how you feel?
2695300	2696300	I don't like it.
2696300	2698300	Oh, sorry. Gary, is this how you feel?
2698300	2701300	I don't like it either, but y'all need to...
2701300	2704300	I trust his dream, and I don't want to die today.
2704300	2707300	And I believe all of you. I believe you've been through some shit.
2707300	2710300	It's putting you on edge. It's making you do all sorts of weird things.
2710300	2713300	We've all seen a lot of messed up shit in the past few days.
2713300	2718300	Maybe even our whole lives, but it's just coming to fruition now for some reason.
2718300	2724300	But I swear, what Keith just did to Mildred is not okay, and I know he's gone now.
2724300	2727300	I know he's gone. Okay? He went down that tunnel.
2727300	2730300	Y'all are gonna go have to find him if you want to find him, okay?
2730300	2733300	He's heading south. That's the way you were heading anyway.
2733300	2735300	So y'all just need to go on and get.
2735300	2736300	Alright, Gary.
2736300	2739300	I'm sorry. I didn't want it to go this way.
2739300	2742300	I'm sorry too, Gary. You're right, that shouldn't have happened.
2742300	2745300	Will you keep an eye on Drew there?
2745300	2748300	I need you to maybe keep him here. Don't let him get anywhere.
2748300	2750300	Yeah, well keep an eye on Drew.
2750300	2752300	Again, that's not Drew. That's Kerry Pages.
2752300	2755300	Drew Kerry. That's a funny little thing we say.
2755300	2758300	Make sure you don't feed him anything with too much sugar,
2758300	2763300	and make sure you give Tyler a treat before bed every night.
2763300	2767300	Sorry about all this. Mildred, we are going to, at some point,
2767300	2771300	time cop our way into finding your daughter, I'm sure of it.
2771300	2773300	She doesn't respond because she's unconscious,
2773300	2776300	because Keith just beat the shit out of her and she's an old woman.
2776300	2778300	I say it again louder.
2782300	2785300	Wake up, lazy bones.
2785300	2787300	Oh, God.
2789300	2793300	Now y'all come back to Daily Pho as soon as you fix this,
2793300	2797300	because I trust that you will, and here come Monday,
2797300	2800300	you come get a steaming hot bowl of seafood pho.
2800300	2802300	That'll be nice.
2802300	2806300	Alright, yeah. We'll do that.
2806300	2808300	I start going toward a tunnel.
2808300	2810300	Same.
