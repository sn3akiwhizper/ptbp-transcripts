0	4120	Salutations, my fellow interdimensional friends.
4120	7760	It's your time and space traveling trash sommelier,
7760	9240	Wolf the dog.
9240	14240	And I'm live from somewhere, some time,
14440	19400	but probably still from 694.2, maybe?
19400	22720	Listen, I don't know where the fuck I am right now.
22720	25400	It's somehow both dark and bright
25400	29520	and there is everything and nothing all at once.
29520	32960	There's also a possum wearing a cowboy hat.
32960	35680	His name is Jeremy.
35680	39180	Uh, anyway, this week's Howlin' with Wolf
39180	43200	is from Newman's Necromorium Funeral Home.
43200	45680	Who got Wolf here reading an ad copy
45680	47780	all because they tweeted about the show
47780	50280	and tagged at Pretending Pod,
50280	53840	a smart business decision in this cutthroat business
53840	56080	of dead folk parlors?
56080	57440	They right.
57440	61080	Ever wondered what to do with your dead friends and family?
61080	64160	Here at Newman's Necromorium Funeral Home,
64160	66320	we take the wonder out of death.
66320	69240	For an astronomical and non-negotiable
69240	70840	price of our choosing,
70840	74040	you won't have to worry about the finer details.
74040	75280	Still not sure?
75280	76520	Meet Stu.
76520	79960	Stu says, the dead make great listeners.
79960	81180	Except Lewis.
81180	83960	That guy keeps screaming that he just wants to go home
83960	85960	and there's been a terrible mistake.
85960	89840	Classic Lewis, now that you sold on the idea,
89840	91640	let us handle you dead.
91640	93680	We'll even wear gloves.
93680	95680	Well damn, thanks Newman.
95680	98080	I would advise you to not listen
98080	100480	to the screams of Classic Lewis.
100480	104480	Every Lewis I've ever known has been a lie and a cheat.
104480	107280	This one is probably no exception.
107280	110540	And every Lewis is also a rat bastard.
110540	114000	But especially a Lewis named Classic Lewis.
114000	116280	Remember, if you want to write up something
116280	119240	for your wolf to howl, tag at Pretending Pod
119240	120960	on Twitter or Instagram.
120960	124760	Or write up a five star review on the Apple Podcasts.
124760	127280	Huge shout out to a concerned observer,
127280	132000	Lobster Memories and Huge Earn for writing reviews.
132000	135780	It makes this interdimensional traveling little wolfie
135780	137560	so gosh darn happy.
137560	139480	And if you want to meet other listeners,
139480	142680	AKA super rad weirdos like yourself,
142680	144400	check out the link to Discord
144400	146520	and the subreddit in the show notes.
146520	149480	Our community isn't big enough yet to be toxic
149480	151580	and it's a real good time to hang out.
151580	154940	Honestly, I'm just there for the memes and pet pics.
154940	158960	But there's a good amount of role play chat as well.
158960	161600	Or maybe you want to put together a one shot
161600	163800	with a group of other listeners.
163800	166160	Bubble gum tree my babies.
166160	171120	The links, as always, are in the damn show notes.
171120	173080	And not to be weird about it,
173080	175960	but if you've listened to the entire first season
175960	178200	of Pretending to be People
178200	181400	and you've been considering joining the Patreon
181400	182760	but you've never done it,
182760	186200	the link to the Patreon's in the show notes.
186200	187120	It's worth it.
187120	189740	And apologies to the PTBP crew
189740	192220	for letting you in on this little secret.
192220	195840	But you can actually sign up for like five bucks.
195840	199720	Then listen to all the bonus episodes in a matter of days.
199720	201920	Then delete your pledge.
201920	204060	They can't stop you.
204060	206280	Is it cooler to just let it ride
206280	209940	and support the creative dreams of some small town weirdos
209940	211860	that you really like to listen to?
211860	216360	No, it's obviously cooler to rip these dumb idiots off.
216360	218460	But you do whatever feels right.
218460	220600	I heard they just finished up another arc
220600	224560	of a 13 episode long mostly homebrew campaign.
224560	228080	And the 26th episode is a session zero
228120	231120	for the upcoming run of Control Copy,
231120	234220	a Delta Green scenario by Dennis Detwiller
234220	239220	chosen by a poll over on patreon.com slash pretending pod.
239280	243440	The link's in the show notes as I have mentioned many times
243440	245600	but you can probably remember it.
245600	248760	It's just patreon.com slash pretending pod.
248760	251240	Sign up for the Circle of Knowledge shirt club
251240	254520	before Halloween and you can receive an exclusive shirt
254520	256600	a whole month sooner.
256600	259320	And check out the YouTube channel.
259320	262440	The composer, some freak named Justin,
262440	265800	continues to slowly upload tracks from the show
265800	269800	onto the ultimate TTRPG playlist.
269800	272880	Guess what that damn link is, you freaks?
272880	275940	Also in the show notes, you can find a link
275940	279480	to a music video for this hot new track.
279480	281600	It's Kudzu with no backbone.
281600	282760	So.
312400	313400	It's Q&A time.
313400	315240	It's Q&A time.
315240	316080	Hell yeah.
316080	316920	Whoa.
316920	318560	The season is done.
318560	320040	The season is over
320040	322400	and it's time to answer questions about the season.
322400	324820	Now we get to find out what happened.
324820	326420	Yeah, in some ways,
326420	330840	I like to think that most of the questions
330840	333840	as far as what actually happened have been answered.
333840	337120	Although, I understand
340000	341260	that that's not the case
341780	342620	and that's okay.
342620	346460	Dude, today a coworker of mine asked me for my phone number
346460	349180	so that they could send me a playlist.
349180	351380	And what are the seven,
351380	353100	not 10 numbers that you told me?
353100	354820	No, I won't be saying that.
356820	358820	He sent me this playlist.
358820	359780	Oh, hell yes.
359780	361180	And it had,
361180	364580	what's the band that sings Radioactive?
364580	366420	Oh, is that Imagine Dragons?
366420	368820	Imagine Dragon Deez Nuts Across Your Face.
368820	369660	Oh, no.
377660	379100	I kept wanting to tell it,
379100	382080	but I was like, wait until we're recording.
383380	385980	We've been hanging out for a while
385980	388940	and I'm not sure I've ever been more proud of you
388940	390020	that you held onto that.
390020	391700	I feel like I got hit by a train.
394580	395500	I did get,
396620	397980	I got Joe with a-
397980	399460	He got me before we started recording
399460	400820	with such a genuine one.
400820	401660	I was like-
401660	403520	It was really good and I was like,
403520	405340	oh, you should have saved it for the pod.
405340	406180	I didn't even see that coming.
406180	407180	I had another one.
407180	408540	I straight up don't,
408540	409900	I don't know if I was in here,
409900	410740	if I wasn't listening.
410740	411580	You were not.
411580	412480	But it was a,
412480	413320	dude,
413320	414160	I just like,
414160	416260	it was like both of us looking at our phones.
416260	417100	I was like,
417100	418900	dude, did you see that thing about the article
418900	420380	about Cho Ken today?
420380	421460	And I went,
421460	423300	Cho Ken?
423300	424140	Oh my God.
424140	425380	Yeah, Cho Ken on Deez Nuts.
426380	427220	Jesus.
427220	428780	I was so genuinely,
428780	430140	I have not heard about this.
430140	430980	Please tell me.
430980	431820	You're like, who's Cho Ken?
433580	434420	My
434420	435260	God.
436900	437740	Anyway,
439020	439940	that was good.
439940	440880	Yeah.
440880	441720	Proud of you.
441720	442540	I think that's enough.
442540	444780	We have enough questions for that to be
447140	448380	our jumping off point.
448380	449740	So let's dive into these.
449740	450980	I'm gonna go ahead and start
450980	453740	with a question here from me.
454700	456420	I'm Zach and I have a question.
456420	457820	We asked for questions,
457820	460980	comments or compliments on Twitter and Reddit and
460980	462820	Zach felt he didn't get enough compliments.
462820	463660	So.
464620	465960	So I'm gonna start this thing off
465960	467280	by complimenting myself.
467280	468360	Zach,
468360	470040	I don't say this a lot,
470040	470880	but
472120	474460	you actually finished a thing.
474460	475300	Good job, man.
475300	476120	That's huge, dude.
476120	476960	Yeah.
477820	478660	All right.
478660	479500	That was genuine.
479500	480500	And I didn't expect to
481500	485600	negate my horrible self-talk to myself,
486660	487540	but here we are.
487540	490500	And so I do have a compliment right off the bat
490500	492460	for the three of you,
492460	493580	each of you.
493580	494400	Joe,
494400	495820	I'll start with you as it's-
495820	497740	Oh, literally individually.
497740	499220	Do you also have one for the group?
499220	501780	I literally didn't plan this at all.
501780	504460	I am not looking at anything.
504460	505840	I didn't have these planned,
505840	508260	but I have a compliment for each of you.
508260	509100	Joe,
509100	512620	having you as a player makes my job
512620	514660	as a GM more fun.
514660	515500	Dope, dude.
515500	517860	Legitimately watching your reactions
517860	519640	to things that happen
519640	521380	and how stoked you get
521380	523860	and how into the story you are at all times
523860	524860	makes me,
525820	527380	oh, I was gonna say horny,
527380	528900	but I'm being genuine.
528900	530420	No, you can say it.
530420	531340	That's so nice, dude.
531340	532500	At first, I thought it was just
532500	533960	a veiled jab at Luke and I.
536540	538900	But no, it makes it more fun as a player at the table.
539820	541180	Yeah, it totally does.
541180	543500	So moving on from the compliments.
552300	553360	End of praise.
554580	556500	No, moving on to Luke.
556500	559220	Luke, you are without a doubt
559220	562680	the most fun and spontaneous person
562680	565500	I've ever like hung out with even.
565780	569380	You are extremely enjoyable to be around
569380	573220	due to your ability to take any situation
573220	575300	and find the levity in it.
575300	577100	I appreciate that so much.
577100	581420	And I specifically within the realm of role-playing,
581420	585580	anytime that I feel you grab the reins out of my hands,
585580	588260	I'm nothing but overjoyed.
588260	589500	Hell yeah.
589500	590320	Thank you.
592560	594460	And back to the questions.
594460	595620	I can't do the same joke again.
595620	597140	And Tom.
597140	597980	You could.
597980	600160	I thought, I almost thought you were just gonna go
600160	603580	into the question, so I was like, I was fine with it.
603580	604820	Thank you.
604820	609820	Thomas, you make jokes that are literally standing
611500	614740	on the precipice of like in and out of game
614740	617460	in a way that, in my opinion,
617460	621180	speaks to the soul of like how we role-play.
621180	626060	Your ability to constantly have one hand in hot water
626060	630760	and one hand in cold water is like absolutely excellent.
630760	635080	Also, I respect you and any opinion that you bring
635080	637900	to the table, regardless of how opposite
637900	640500	of what I've just said is.
640500	642020	Basically, you.
642020	647020	You are one of the only people whose opinion I trust.
655740	656580	Thank you.
658140	660580	Also, the earliest stuff about me being the voice
660580	663900	of a role-playing generation, I wonder if you said yes.
663900	665040	Agreed.
665040	667540	Legitimately though, I have a hard time taking
667540	669260	anyone else's opinion.
669260	670540	I'm very controlling.
670580	675540	I think we all know this and I respect that a lot of you
675540	677740	and I think you're a great dude.
677740	678580	Thanks, bro.
678580	679460	Same, please.
679460	681820	I love you guys so much
681820	685340	and you have changed my life for the better.
685340	686180	Same.
686180	687420	Back at you, man.
687420	689620	I like you so much.
689620	694300	I like barely, I barely remember a time with you.
694300	697940	I love so much about you.
697940	701300	I like don't remember a time in my life
701300	703980	not playing this, even though it's only been.
703980	706060	Yeah, I've blacked out all memories of life.
706060	707900	Even though it's been more.
707900	709980	Yeah, we've been doing it for like 10 years.
711340	712700	No, I love you too.
712700	713540	We love you too.
713540	714360	Fuck all that.
714360	715200	Shut up.
715200	716040	All right, we've got a question from.
716040	716860	Oh, wait, no, no.
716860	717700	You said you had a question for us.
717700	720620	We have to jerk each other off real quick.
720620	721460	To finish.
723100	726900	All right, so the question that I have is actually
726900	731620	a question that I will ask at the top of the next episode,
731620	732800	the next Q&A episode.
732800	735060	I have a personal question for you guys.
735940	738540	It's a teaser for next week.
738540	741080	We could say you can expect to hear Justin
741080	742260	on that next episode.
742260	743900	That's right, that's right.
743900	747180	Justin will be here for next week's Q&A.
747180	748780	Check back in at 8.30.
751100	752260	Justin's busy right now.
752260	753540	All right, let's dive in here.
753540	755860	We've got a question from.
755860	758180	It was all a snow globe.
758180	761100	They say, I hope it's okay to ask a few.
761100	761940	It is.
761940	764580	That was a classic reference to that one show.
764580	768420	I was gonna say, do you millennials get that reference?
768420	772220	Yeah, it's the thing where Chris O'Dowd
772220	775220	dropped the snow globe in Travel Man.
775220	776180	Okay.
776180	777620	It's Saint something, right?
777620	778520	Oh, okay.
778520	779420	Saint Elmo.
779420	781660	It's a spoiler no matter what.
781660	783340	Once I'm a very drunk mom.
783340	784540	Be careful.
784540	787220	Oh yeah, just in case anybody's trying to watch
787220	788060	Men in Black.
788060	789620	That hospital show or whatever.
790580	792700	They were in a marble and the marble had fake snow in it.
792700	794100	Was it Saint Elsewhere?
794100	795100	Saint Elsewhere, yeah.
795100	796260	Okay, so real quick.
796260	799780	Once I'm a very drunk mom in a bar in Colorado.
801180	802580	It could be so much quicker.
803700	807300	Once I'm a very drunk mom in a bar in Colorado
807300	809940	asked me how old I was and I was like 29 at the time
809940	812620	and I said 29 and she goes,
812620	814220	oh, you're just like my son.
814220	815700	You're a millennium.
815700	817380	You're a millennium.
819380	820860	I am.
820860	821700	I'm a millennium.
821700	822540	That's really good.
822540	823380	Yeah.
823380	824220	Okay, that's perfect.
824220	826540	They asked, it was all snow globe, asks,
826540	830500	who was the person in the woods in episode six?
830500	831940	Charles Donovan.
831940	832780	Okay.
832780	834420	I should have asked who you thought it was
834420	836740	but that would just belabor the whole part.
836740	837580	Moving on.
837580	838400	I would say, oh.
838400	839240	Next question.
839240	842040	Who is the ambiguously British man
842040	844120	in the circle of white powder?
844120	846360	I believe they are talking about the person
846360	848480	that Lindsay's character talks to
848480	851000	in the contention woods arc.
851000	855200	That was an agent of Pisces.
855200	860200	Delta Green has a British wing of its existence
861040	862920	and they are called Pisces.
862920	867460	And I believe that man had a tattoo somewhere
867460	870220	and I believe, I did not look this up,
870220	874460	but I think that I made that tattoo a reference
874460	877800	to the fact that he was in Pisces.
877800	879400	It might've even been a fish.
879400	882220	Like it straight up might've been a fish tattoo.
882220	883060	So, okay.
883060	884880	So if any of us had run into him,
884880	886340	we would have known right away.
886340	888780	Yes.
888780	889700	Next question.
889700	890540	Fish, Pisces.
890540	893220	So that's deep lore for somebody
893220	894460	who knows Delta Green lore.
894460	896700	Oh, that's some real deep lore.
896780	897600	That wasn't for us.
897600	898820	No.
898820	899660	Zach, yeah.
899660	901860	Speaking of like your own deep lore,
901860	903260	I totally thought you were like,
903260	904580	oh yeah, that was Pisces.
904580	906660	They were competing against Myriad.
906660	908140	You never really ran into them,
908140	909420	but they were there the whole time.
909420	912860	You guys literally never ran into anyone from Pisces.
912860	915300	My cool fish men brigade.
915300	918540	Actual company behind, was it Bar Corp?
918540	921220	Bar Corp owned by Pisces.
921220	922040	No.
922040	922880	So next question.
922880	924320	What does Joe smell like?
925080	927480	What flavor vape do you have?
927480	928320	Yeah.
928320	929520	I got some strawberry milk tonight.
929520	931660	Oh, that is an answer.
931660	932500	All right.
932500	934640	That's pretty much what he smells like just in general.
934640	937240	I've known him since middle school.
937240	938360	Joe, middle school.
938360	939280	You've got the option.
939280	941640	Chocolate, vanilla.
941640	942960	Is it called vanilla milk?
942960	944160	Regular.
944160	945040	2%.
945040	948400	Chocolate, milk, or strawberry?
948400	949240	Strawberry.
949240	950060	Oh, all right.
950060	952160	And moving on, what was the asylum all about?
952160	954240	Specifically the Satan plot line
954240	956200	that apparently got dropped.
956200	958800	Yeah, because I did mention at one point
958800	962080	that the Satan, somebody asked about it mid-game.
962080	964680	And I was like, yeah, like as an NPC,
964680	968600	I think I said, you guys didn't look into that very much,
968600	969800	so we didn't worry about it.
969800	972000	I thought that you guys were gonna try to follow
972000	975320	the agents, the dead president's cell,
975320	977640	Kennedy, McKinley, and Harrison
977640	979440	back to wherever they came from,
979440	983120	or at least try to hitch more of a ride on what they had.
983120	984440	But as we were role-playing,
984440	987460	it just felt right to kind of leave you out in the cold.
987460	990260	I could use that sentence for all role-playing.
991760	994200	Yeah, that's your go-to instinct as a GM.
994200	996680	And I'm trying to get better at it, all right?
1000840	1002200	We're all growing.
1002200	1004280	That's one thing that I'm gonna work on.
1004280	1007280	No, it's fun and it leads to, I don't know.
1007280	1011000	But if we do wanna not go 113 episodes again.
1011000	1012320	Yeah, exactly.
1012320	1013320	We go to the mill.
1016120	1018020	So what was the asylum all about?
1018020	1021100	So basically there's a woman there named,
1021100	1025060	code name Satan, not actually birth name Satan.
1025060	1029280	And she was in charge of running these different teams
1029280	1032920	of essentially what Delta Green Lore would call cowboys.
1032920	1035440	So your A through Z cells.
1035440	1038000	But I decided instead of the modern day
1038000	1039320	using A through Z cells,
1039320	1041520	they would have gotten rid of it by then
1041520	1044440	and come up with some fun alternatives.
1044440	1047840	So I thought dead presidents was a fun combo of things.
1047840	1048720	So I went with that.
1048720	1052500	But that is also where K cell was run out of,
1052500	1055880	because they originally started with the alphabet cells
1055880	1058740	as cowboys, essentially fighting against
1058740	1061400	the unnatural threat to the world,
1061400	1064580	not with government oversight.
1064580	1069020	And so that is what the asylum is specifically all about.
1069020	1072620	The woman who runs it, she's a black and white character.
1072620	1073900	She's got a lot going on.
1073900	1075520	She lives in the middle.
1075520	1076620	Yeah, I don't know.
1077980	1081060	Everyone's got like a middling agenda.
1081060	1082940	In Delta Green, from what I can tell,
1082940	1085160	there aren't a lot of like specifically good
1085160	1087820	or specifically bad people.
1087820	1090940	Some people get turned bad by circumstance,
1090940	1095500	but everyone's kind of like trying to do their best
1095500	1097300	with the hand they've been dealt.
1097300	1098180	I don't know.
1098180	1100760	So that's what was happening at the asylum.
1100760	1102540	If somebody else asks a question about it later,
1102540	1105620	which I bet they do, I might add to that.
1105620	1107320	And that part of Delta Green,
1107320	1109400	it just really stresses me out when we're playing it,
1109400	1112160	because it's not like real life where you know right away,
1112160	1114460	like, oh, do they believe in Jesus?
1114460	1115300	They're good or bad.
1115300	1118420	You can just know, and all the uncertainty
1118420	1120820	and like the grayness, it gives me a headache.
1120820	1121660	Yeah.
1121660	1122900	No, thank you.
1122900	1123740	Yeah.
1123740	1128740	Hey, why don't you just ask the NPCs if they believe in Jesus?
1128740	1131900	Are you a good person or a bad person?
1131900	1133380	So they finish it out.
1133380	1135140	Snow Globe finishes it out by saying,
1135140	1136860	thank you all for everything.
1136860	1139300	This is by far my favorite podcast,
1139300	1140620	which is just a very nice thing.
1140620	1141860	Thanks, us too.
1141860	1142820	It's a nice thing to say.
1142820	1144560	It is ours as well.
1144560	1146580	Ain't on a no, no, no.
1146580	1147420	Is that how you say it?
1147420	1148260	Ain't on a no, no, no.
1149100	1151060	Ain't on a no, no, no.
1151060	1153420	Which is No Way Hang On.
1153420	1155500	That's one of our beautiful mods
1155500	1157580	over on the subreddit and the discord.
1157580	1158620	We've got a question.
1158620	1161900	What's y'all's favorite karaoke jam?
1161900	1164340	Soak Up The Sun by Shirl Crow.
1164340	1166300	That's good.
1166300	1167780	Soak Up The Sun is real good.
1167780	1168860	I just do Beatles songs,
1168860	1170140	cause I know the words already.
1170140	1170980	Yep.
1172500	1174460	And what are Beatles songs?
1174460	1176500	It's this band that I've been into lately.
1176500	1177460	They're kind of coming up.
1177940	1179840	And Thomas, do you do karaoke?
1179840	1181040	I actually never have.
1181040	1181880	Really?
1181880	1182700	Really.
1182700	1185100	Wait, when we did karaoke at my house, did you not sing?
1185100	1186060	Oh, I probably did.
1186060	1188700	But like drunk, living room karaoke.
1188700	1191220	I've never been in a bar full of people,
1191220	1194780	like strangers, selected a song and sang that song.
1194780	1195700	Yeah.
1195700	1197940	Thomas, you were actually there though
1197940	1200780	for my birthday a couple of years ago.
1200780	1201820	After the ball game.
1201820	1205180	Yeah, you got me tickets to a Cardinals game
1205220	1207020	for my birthday.
1207020	1209980	That was a surprise, which was fucking rad.
1209980	1213320	We went and hung out and watched a day game in St. Louis
1213320	1214380	that I didn't know was happening.
1214380	1216320	Yeah, I got you those tickets,
1216320	1219220	not your wife and my partner.
1219220	1220060	You know what?
1220060	1221060	It actually makes more sense
1221060	1223660	that it was my wife who got me those tickets.
1223660	1226020	And then after the ball game, we like-
1226020	1227560	There's a chance I totally pitched in.
1227560	1228400	I don't know.
1228400	1229220	Yeah, I don't know, man.
1229220	1230060	Who knows?
1230060	1230900	But I would bet.
1230900	1233440	I was just willing to give you full credit here
1233440	1234460	on the recording.
1234460	1236820	Oh yeah, just like if either of the other people
1236820	1239260	involved heard that, they would probably be like, what?
1239260	1240860	Oh, they're not listening.
1240860	1242060	They're not listening to this?
1242060	1242900	That's fair.
1242900	1247000	And so I sing my go-to karaoke jam,
1247000	1250500	which we have posted a video of me singing
1250500	1252180	on Instagram and Twitter.
1252180	1253020	You can find it there.
1253020	1253860	And that is me singing-
1253860	1255180	Oh baby, baby.
1256540	1260380	How was I supposed to know?
1260380	1262700	My go-to is Hit Me Baby One More Time by Britney Spears,
1262700	1266220	specifically because it is just out of my range.
1266220	1268780	Zach, I was actually going through my Instagram
1268780	1272220	story archives the other day and came across those videos.
1272220	1274700	And do you remember the guy who sung After You?
1274700	1277060	No, I was on a high.
1279540	1283780	He was very red and drunk.
1283780	1284740	Oh yeah, classic.
1284740	1285580	Like karaoke.
1285580	1287020	The Cardinals colors.
1287020	1289060	Well, that's Neil.
1289060	1292060	Looked like yellow teeth, red face.
1292260	1295180	It looked like most of the guys at a Cardinals game,
1295180	1298820	like meaning like late forties, a polo.
1298820	1300980	And they love the polos.
1300980	1304140	He was shit-faced, but passionate.
1304140	1309140	And he was singing Closing Time at like 3 p.m. I bet.
1310800	1311680	I love that song.
1311680	1313940	Compliment from ainonanonono.
1313940	1314900	Nice cock, bro.
1314900	1315740	Thank you.
1315740	1316560	Thanks.
1316560	1317400	Wouldn't you like to know?
1317400	1319840	All right, and a question from ainonanonono.
1319860	1322760	I remember Zach delivering some well-deserved praise
1322760	1325640	to Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency,
1325640	1329420	which shares some fun elements with season one of PTBP.
1329420	1332000	What other foundational media or artists
1332000	1334420	have influenced y'all in this season
1334420	1337620	as handler and players?
1337620	1342080	Anyone have an inspiration to you as a player
1342080	1344200	or just to give you like a head space
1344200	1346040	of what this game we're playing was?
1346040	1346920	I just do whatever I want.
1346920	1349280	Yeah, there, yeah, yeah.
1349760	1350840	The most truthful answer.
1350840	1353320	Yeah, Wild West Arc was all Deadwood in my brain.
1353320	1354160	Yeah.
1354160	1356000	Deadwood was what I would reference in my brain.
1356000	1356840	Mine was Red Dead Redemption.
1356840	1359580	In general, just all police media.
1362000	1364480	Yeah, like that pop culture is inundated with
1364480	1366800	so just lots of cop stereotypes
1366800	1371000	and then the actual place we live for.
1371000	1372600	Yeah, for sure.
1372600	1376000	The actual place we live and like going hiking
1376000	1378880	or just visiting other small towns around
1379440	1383360	and getting a feel for what life is like in a smaller town.
1383360	1385480	I actually drove through Mountain Grove.
1385480	1387600	I mean, literally just passed it.
1387600	1388840	You literally drove through.
1388840	1390680	I literally drove through.
1390680	1392440	You're the one who drove through Mountain Grove.
1392440	1393280	I drove through.
1393280	1394920	You drove through the downtown just like
1394920	1395760	Mountain Grove.
1395760	1397240	Blues Brothers style like that mall.
1397240	1399240	Hung out for a little bit, just drove around.
1399240	1402180	That's the small town that I stole the map from
1402180	1403760	for contention.
1403760	1404580	Oh, nice.
1404580	1405520	Oh, really?
1405520	1408800	I stole the map from Mountain Grove, Missouri.
1409760	1410600	The layout of the roads and things.
1410600	1411640	Yeah, I did.
1411640	1413360	I dated someone and grew up there
1413360	1417360	and when I was like 19 and we drove out there a few times
1417360	1419320	to hang out with her parents.
1419320	1422240	And it was, it's very small.
1422240	1423080	It's really small, yeah.
1423080	1424400	You've been to contention then.
1424400	1425720	Yeah, you've been to contention.
1425720	1429920	All right, yeah, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency
1429920	1430760	and like-
1430760	1434120	Anything ever Delta Green or not Delta Green,
1434120	1437240	but like Lovecraft.
1437260	1442260	I've literally never like read Lovecraft.
1444440	1445800	I've seen some movies.
1448560	1449400	It's good.
1451920	1454040	I don't read, but read Dirk Gently's
1454040	1455260	Holistic Detective Agency.
1455260	1456500	I took a lot from that.
1456500	1458320	Compliment, thanks for making me laugh so hard.
1458320	1460760	I cried a few times.
1460760	1461600	Wow.
1461600	1462440	I'm glad we did it to you
1462440	1463920	because we did it to ourselves a lot.
1463920	1464760	Oh yeah.
1465600	1468800	We had more fun making it than you did listening to it.
1468800	1469640	Oh, 100%.
1469640	1472400	And I'm glad our podcast made you so hard, you cried.
1473920	1478920	L-Elephant, L-Elephant, L-Elephant, L-Elephant.
1479800	1482960	L-Elephant, L-Elephant, L-Elephant.
1482960	1484120	I think it's just L-Elephant.
1484120	1487840	L-Elephant, L-Elephant.
1487840	1489720	Like their name is probably L.
1489720	1492320	Congrats on finishing the first season.
1492320	1493160	Thanks.
1493160	1494000	Thank you.
1494080	1497240	There have been a lot of little Easter eggs
1497240	1499480	for people paying a lot of attention.
1499480	1502320	There was, quote, no backbone being,
1502320	1505040	oh, by the way, we're doing spoilers.
1505040	1506040	Yeah, big time.
1508320	1509880	We might need Dog to say that.
1512000	1512840	Yeah, well.
1512840	1513680	Who's Dog?
1513680	1514500	We'll have Dog.
1514500	1516480	Joe's on a first, last name basis.
1516480	1517320	Last name basis, yeah.
1517320	1518160	We know each other pretty well.
1518160	1519000	Joe's on a last name basis with Dog.
1519000	1521160	No, he has to call him Mr. Dog.
1521160	1522640	Over the years, we've gotten to know each other
1522680	1524080	pretty well.
1524080	1525480	I think I can call him Dog.
1528120	1532080	No backbone being a more relevant song than first thought.
1532080	1534360	Yes, classic.
1534360	1538160	The Wizard of Oznod with what everyone lost
1538160	1540160	slash was searching for in the raid
1540160	1542000	on Marvin Glass's compound.
1542000	1545160	I think at one point you named some corpses
1545160	1547200	after the last podcast on the left crew.
1547200	1551400	Actually, those were the costumes that Billy Harrison
1551440	1554280	was tied up in the back of Charles Donovan's trunk
1554280	1556360	and also in Charles Donovan's trunk
1556360	1559320	was Charles Donovan's extra disguises
1559320	1562400	in which he used the last podcast on the left crew
1562400	1563600	as covers.
1563600	1566120	Oh, what are some of your favorite Easter eggs
1566120	1568640	no one has mentioned yet?
1568640	1569880	What's an anagram?
1571500	1572340	Am I thinking of the right?
1572340	1573760	Whether it's all mixed up.
1573760	1574680	It's all mixed up, yes.
1574680	1579680	Okay, so Tildy B. Mitchell is an anagram.
1580160	1581560	Oh, fuck, what's it for though?
1581560	1585080	I refuse to look for anagrams in every name you give us.
1585080	1590080	I'm looking up anagram solver.
1590600	1592200	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1592200	1595500	It's not gonna give it to you because it's like half baked.
1595500	1597200	It's like lit B.
1597200	1598040	It's lit.
1598040	1598880	How do you spell Tildy?
1598880	1603320	Oh, T-I-L-D-E B as B
1603320	1606160	and then Mitchell, M-I-T-C-H-E-L-L.
1606160	1607000	But lit is part of it?
1607000	1607840	It's lit.
1607840	1608800	Fucking good, dude.
1608800	1611140	Meet Bill Ted.
1613680	1614520	Wait, are you for real?
1614520	1615880	Good anagram, bro.
1615880	1617160	What, Bill Ted?
1617160	1619200	Yeah, like Bill and Ted because they time travel.
1619200	1621840	So you had the time travel and the fact that she was
1621840	1625280	zombie-ish or undead-ish from that early on
1625280	1626100	that you just named her.
1626100	1627760	Holy fuck, that's cool.
1627760	1629000	I thought that came later.
1629000	1630840	I thought those revelations came later.
1630840	1633860	That is what Keith might name his meat monster.
1636680	1638280	Lich meet Bill Ted.
1638760	1639600	Nice, good one.
1639600	1640680	But that was her name.
1640680	1642320	Tildy B. Mitchell.
1642320	1643240	Tildy B. Mitchell.
1643240	1645320	Yeah, like exactly.
1645320	1646680	Like from birth, right?
1646680	1647520	Yeah.
1647520	1648340	I guess that.
1648340	1649180	She was destined.
1649180	1650020	That was just fun for Zach.
1650020	1652360	That's just a fun detail outside of the canon.
1652360	1654200	Yeah, that doesn't mean anything.
1654200	1655040	It's an Easter egg.
1655040	1656480	That's just a Zach fun time.
1656480	1657600	What's another Easter egg?
1657600	1661620	There's one that a fan found that you definitely put in,
1661620	1664960	none of us caught was the Mary Coles Institute
1664960	1665800	or whatever it was.
1665960	1668760	It was an acronym for consume, was it?
1668760	1670000	Consume, yeah.
1670000	1675000	The Coles Orphanage colon new school under modern etiquette.
1676240	1679000	Somebody pointed that out on Twitter and it blew my mind.
1679000	1682560	I thought that I made it so stilted
1682560	1684920	that you guys would be like, why is it that?
1684920	1687280	Every time you do that, I'm just like,
1687280	1691120	I'm not gonna make Zach feel bad about his English.
1691120	1696120	Well, now you know to make fun of me
1696560	1699700	and reveal my hidden secrets,
1699700	1701240	but also it might hurt my feelings.
1701240	1705200	So, you know, it's a time when we're like,
1705200	1708440	that must be one of your weird things, right?
1708440	1712700	And you're just like, no, no, no, no, Thomas.
1713680	1715480	Anyway, so that's one.
1715480	1718660	Consume is definitely one that I really liked.
1718660	1722060	Oh, this one's dumb.
1722060	1726420	This one's so dumb, but Oz Mayhem Wolf,
1726420	1731420	his brother was Elby, E-L-B-Y, which is not a name.
1732180	1733180	But like pounds or?
1733180	1736300	Yeah, L-B and ounces.
1736300	1738340	That's good, that's a good one.
1738340	1739180	I like that.
1739180	1740900	That was real stupid.
1740900	1742660	That's real good.
1742660	1743900	Did we ever meet Elby?
1743900	1745460	No, he just talked about him.
1745460	1746300	He mentioned him, yeah.
1746460	1747300	Oh, okay.
1747300	1748900	He mentioned him once.
1748900	1752540	Keith Vigna, Vigna is a type of bean or something.
1752540	1756780	Yeah, Vigna is a genus, I think, of bean.
1756780	1758680	It's a science version of a bean.
1760180	1761260	It's a sciency bean.
1761260	1762460	It's a science bean.
1762460	1767140	John Lee Pettymore is named from the song,
1767140	1770140	Copperhead Road by Steve Earle.
1770140	1771860	We kind of made his dad something else,
1771860	1775400	but I guess Kevin is literally the character
1775400	1776240	in Copperhead Road.
1777200	1778040	Exactly.
1778040	1778880	Clark was born with a tail.
1778880	1780960	Just a little Easter egg for you.
1780960	1782400	And never got it removed.
1782400	1783240	He had it the whole campaign.
1783240	1784080	The whole time.
1784080	1784920	The whole time.
1784920	1786680	If you just looked at his back,
1786680	1788080	you would have seen it wagging every now and then.
1788080	1789920	If you'd done an alertness check,
1789920	1793780	you actually had detailed emotional responses for the tail.
1793780	1794960	I had rolls I could have made.
1794960	1796320	For those of you who are gonna go back
1796320	1798100	and listen through the campaign,
1798100	1800400	you'll find a slight whooshing sound.
1804160	1806000	I do remember one last Easter egg.
1806680	1808280	Right before we started this whole thing,
1808280	1810560	Zach was like, okay, your character is God.
1810560	1812480	This is all a dream that he's created
1812480	1813560	for the other characters.
1813560	1815360	So just remember that at the end.
1816960	1818100	I was like, okay, yeah, for sure.
1818100	1818940	I wrote it down.
1818940	1820200	The only thing in my notes.
1821600	1822440	You're God.
1823760	1825520	What are you looking at?
1825520	1827760	Trying to find my cheat sheet.
1827760	1829560	Just show you guys my cheat sheet
1829560	1831040	where I had listed like.
1831040	1834920	There was, I was frantically reading as fast as I could.
1835360	1838880	Was trying to consume all the little nuggets
1838880	1840520	as it went by.
1840520	1842800	There was a bunch of stuff in there, man.
1842800	1845040	I was on top of a lot of stuff that was happening
1845040	1847000	on certain time restraints for a while.
1847000	1851160	Yeah, that was a weird time when you guys were like
1851160	1853160	at the end of your time in contention
1853160	1856480	when all the moving parts were happening.
1856480	1857680	And I was trying to keep track of it.
1857680	1859400	All right, let's move on.
1859400	1861140	Hope it's okay to do two questions.
1861140	1862360	It is, we'll keep going.
1862360	1863640	A little while ago,
1863640	1866400	I had an idea about a connection to Martin Cupertino
1866400	1869920	being an influential person wanting to create cube
1869920	1872000	during the calm comfy campground arc
1872000	1875280	and the contention boys chasing down the origins
1875280	1877520	of what they called ball.
1877520	1880680	I get that Martin was a Steve Jobs stand in,
1880680	1885680	but was the cube versus ball connection intentional
1885920	1889120	or am I grasping at straws?
1889120	1893020	I'm gonna turn this one over to Thomas for the answer.
1893500	1895780	Unfortunately, grasping at straws cube
1895780	1899580	was just a parody of the original iMac.
1899580	1901860	And then like the crazy promises about cube
1901860	1905780	were just like Zombocom style like nonsense
1905780	1908180	and over promising like tech world.
1908180	1911300	Like this will solve every problem anybody's ever had.
1911300	1912140	It's the normal stuff.
1912140	1916980	It's a very, very, very simple broad parody of Steve Jobs.
1923460	1924820	We got to think about our pace.
1924820	1929140	Cause I think we have 50 total in three.
1929140	1931060	Yeah, we're on page one of nine.
1931060	1933140	The reason it was called, we are 30 minutes in.
1933140	1934140	The reason it was called cube
1934140	1936900	is cause the iMac is like a cube shape kind of.
1936900	1937740	Nice.
1937740	1940380	Soren Ash asks.
1940380	1942740	Oh yeah, you guys keep going, I'm gonna go pee.
1942740	1944580	Oh, I didn't know you were peeing right now.
1944580	1945980	This isn't one we can answer.
1947340	1948180	We could try.
1948180	1949340	I'll read it and we'll try.
1949340	1952180	Okay, so the things I've racked up over time.
1952220	1955500	How did Marvin get removed from the myriad hive mind?
1955500	1957100	That's a question I've had myself.
1957100	1961620	Yeah, so here's my best guess.
1961620	1964220	Marvin, he just didn't want to be in it anymore.
1964220	1966260	That was my, exactly what I was gonna say.
1966260	1967660	He just wanted it more.
1967660	1970740	Like kind of the odd, but he like he wanted out and he did.
1970740	1972940	I can't remember if I said this on the podcast
1972940	1974460	or if it was after a session one time,
1974460	1978220	but I wondered if he was some link in an evolution
1978220	1980740	between Tildy and what we know as myriad,
1980740	1981900	whether he was in the middle
1981900	1984260	or he was an evolved beyond myriad.
1984260	1986780	I think he was just like a funny guy.
1986780	1988340	He's just a wild and crazy dude.
1988340	1989180	Next question.
1989180	1991740	Yeah, were Marvin's sons his biological sons?
1991740	1992580	Yes.
1992580	1993420	Was the glass syndicate just a puppet
1993420	1994820	for some greater organization?
1994820	1995660	Yes, next question.
1995660	1997100	Yeah, yes and yes.
1997100	1998940	What was Stan and Nancy's agenda
1998940	2001940	and by extension that of the city asylum?
2001940	2002780	Zach never knew.
2002780	2003940	He didn't actually have.
2004820	2007940	And yes, he did just keep forgetting her name.
2007940	2009820	He wanted, they were actually,
2009820	2012660	the city asylum was trying to research the brown note.
2012660	2013900	Right, yeah.
2013900	2015420	Okay, we've covered the first few.
2015420	2017700	Yeah, we got it all Zach, pretty thoroughly.
2017700	2018900	Do you guys have any questions?
2018900	2020020	Should I add in anything?
2020020	2021980	I was wondering how did Marvin get removed
2021980	2024260	from myriad hive mind?
2024260	2025700	How did Marvin remove himself?
2025700	2026780	Smart question, Joe.
2026780	2028300	Yeah, good question.
2028300	2031380	Okay, so Marvin was like the fallen angel essentially
2031380	2033620	of these creatures
2033620	2035980	and that's all I ever really thought about it.
2035980	2037260	I like it though, that's also cool.
2037300	2039820	Well, that would also be a great campaign,
2039820	2040660	a mini campaign.
2040660	2044140	Yeah, it really, I honestly had a certain thought
2044140	2046820	as we were recording from 100 on.
2046820	2051020	I was like, I could do at least three or four more spin-offs.
2051020	2053300	Like we could do this theoretically forever.
2053300	2055900	Yeah, oh yeah, Jesus Christ Ministries
2055900	2059340	could have easily had its own one shot,
2059340	2060900	which I was planning for a while
2060900	2062460	and then abandoned at a certain point.
2062460	2064060	Well, that was Fergie's thing, right?
2064060	2064900	Yeah.
2064900	2066860	Fergie's whole crime organization.
2066860	2070220	With all those little kids that were all like androids.
2070220	2073940	Yeah, oh, we could play Android orphans.
2073940	2077040	Yeah, like that would be very fun.
2077040	2080500	So that's all I really ever had for Marvin.
2080500	2081940	Oh, were his sons biological?
2081940	2082980	No, they were not.
2082980	2083820	What was their deal?
2083820	2084660	Were they created?
2084660	2088140	No, he was dealing in trafficking
2088140	2091980	and so he took two of the strongest ones
2091980	2096180	from the Den of Sin and made them his sons.
2096180	2098580	Gotcha, so they know they're not his sons.
2098580	2102260	They have been, they had been like brainwashed
2102260	2107060	to basically just like the Glass family was their family.
2107060	2109860	They were Glass boys like through and through,
2109860	2111680	but one of them had their mind melted
2111680	2113480	before the season started
2113480	2118480	and the other one got sent to the dark place.
2118560	2123000	So they were not role played through very thoroughly
2123000	2125780	just because of their circumstances.
2125780	2129880	Another question here, biological sons.
2129880	2131400	Was the Glass syndicate just a puppet
2131400	2132640	for some greater organization?
2132640	2134160	The Glass syndicate was not a puppet.
2134160	2137760	The Glass syndicate was held strong by Marvin Glass
2137760	2140400	who definitely held his own against Myriad.
2140400	2142400	That's interesting, so that's, we disagree on that.
2142400	2143600	Okay, that's fair.
2143600	2144640	What was your guys' answer?
2144640	2145480	We said yes.
2146320	2149320	And who was the hand?
2149320	2151160	We said yes, next question.
2151160	2155400	Next question, what was Man Stan Steen's agenda
2155400	2158760	and by extension that of the city asylum?
2158760	2161040	Okay, so these are two very different questions
2161040	2163120	specifically because the city asylum
2163120	2168080	was holding Stan Man Steen as a prisoner at the time.
2168080	2171400	He was let out only to go to his daughter's funeral
2171400	2175240	as a courtesy and he used that time
2175240	2178240	to get the fuck out of existence
2178240	2182560	which was his goal due to his ability to see.
2183800	2186720	He was living the same kind of life where you guys were
2186720	2190960	where his idea of the world kept changing.
2190960	2193360	Every single time something unnatural happened,
2193360	2196440	I changed the town of contention slightly
2196440	2198720	and the main clue of that change
2198720	2203720	was the name of your fourth police officer in contention
2203720	2206120	and small other changes happened
2206120	2209200	but the only one that we really stumbled across in game
2209200	2211240	was Randy Angst.
2211240	2213720	Those were like set about as little things
2213720	2217800	that could pop up if the right questions were asked
2217800	2220400	which I should have, again,
2220400	2222120	just learning how to be a better GM
2222120	2224400	pushed that theme forward.
2224400	2227040	But Stan was always aware of these changes like we were.
2227040	2228320	He very much was.
2228760	2229600	I thought they felt weird.
2229600	2233640	Yep, and so he fucked off and when he fucked off,
2233640	2236320	he landed himself in a heap of trouble
2236320	2238880	and then eventually got a hold of a phone
2238880	2243880	and needed some help from the future pulp hero overseer.
2245200	2246200	Yeah, at the end there.
2246200	2250080	So that would be a fun thing to look into.
2250080	2251920	I would love that story.
2251920	2254640	Okay, so yeah, he only showed up twice
2254640	2258680	but I thought of him as just another person
2258680	2260520	who is dealing with the same thing
2260520	2263040	where he saw what was happening in the world.
2263040	2265560	There were some other people like that as well.
2265560	2267560	Mildred Mitchell being one of them.
2267560	2271280	If you guys had talked about your fourth officer around her,
2271280	2275520	she would have gotten the name wrong like you guys had.
2275520	2279280	Were K cell and the FBI agents working for the same group?
2279280	2281080	Yes, but in different time periods.
2281080	2282200	Given that in the ending,
2282200	2284280	the FBI agents were answering to the lady
2284760	2285960	that got dubbed Satan,
2285960	2290120	it seems as though there was another pernicious element
2290120	2294320	at play and that K cell was likely opposed to them.
2294320	2297160	To clarify, my working theory is that the FBI agents
2297160	2300760	working for Satan are an M-A-R-Y-esque threat
2300760	2302560	with some evil agenda in mind.
2302560	2304600	Yes, I mean, they are as much a threat
2304600	2307160	as the group of cowboys are a threat
2307160	2309120	in traditional Delta Green lore,
2309120	2312200	which, you know, Delta Green agents are a threat, man.
2312200	2314200	That's just kind of how it happens.
2314960	2315800	Their goal is to-
2315800	2316880	Mr. Steal Your Girl.
2316880	2318600	Yeah, exactly.
2318600	2323600	And so that is the reason why the father of Maggie Cook,
2325080	2326940	I almost said Tim Cook,
2326940	2331080	well, it was Jim Cook, which is why I called him that,
2331080	2334600	is Jim Cook, he worked for Satan
2334600	2338620	and that's why he had a reference to Satan in his house.
2338620	2340920	But by the end of his time,
2340960	2344920	he was working against her machinations.
2344920	2349520	So moving on, what was up with all the numbers plague deal?
2349520	2351480	What was up with the numbers plague deal?
2351480	2353720	What was the overseer's original motivation
2353720	2355060	for setting it off?
2355060	2358440	Also, it seemed like the overseer considered that run
2358440	2363340	a quote, success, despite everyone dying on that go round.
2363340	2364180	Why?
2364180	2366740	Did we know that Joe set that off, Luke?
2366740	2369000	I have, I don't think so.
2369000	2370640	It seemed like it'd be fun.
2371280	2373360	Get the fuck out of our house.
2373360	2374460	They got into you.
2374460	2375300	That was cool.
2377640	2378560	Answer the question, Joe.
2378560	2379400	I don't have an answer.
2379400	2382220	You set off that, you were the overseer at that point.
2382220	2383880	I had not become the overseer yet.
2383880	2387160	So basically the overseer got a hold of someone
2387160	2389680	with good intentions from the other side.
2389680	2393360	I had it so that the overseer would make lots of mistakes
2393360	2396640	throughout his time because in Delta Green,
2396640	2400740	the characters traditionally 60% of the time
2400740	2401960	succeed on stuff.
2401960	2405080	And so I kept that in mind as I worked
2405080	2407020	through the overseer's plan.
2407020	2412020	And his plan for CSU and for Bar Corp was,
2412840	2417840	he did not plan for CSU to become a crazy suicide haven.
2418960	2421200	That was not his plan at all.
2421200	2426200	His plan was to give this woman, this activist,
2427240	2431740	on CSU's campus, the ability to change the mind
2431740	2434300	of Bruce Robin, the leader of Bar Corp,
2434300	2438520	and make him a better leader as the head
2438520	2443360	of the biggest corporation in the city.
2443360	2447160	And so he failed in that.
2447160	2451280	And accidentally set off a whole thing
2451280	2454120	where basically the spell went cattywampus
2454120	2456160	and the cleanup needed to happen.
2456560	2457400	It was almost working though
2457400	2458680	because didn't we run into people saying
2458680	2460240	that he's had a change of heart
2460240	2461480	and has been doing things better lately?
2461480	2462320	Exactly. That's cool.
2462320	2465600	It was so close to working, but something was off,
2465600	2469280	which is just kind of a constant in Delta Green
2469280	2471220	is that, yeah, you can use the unnatural
2471220	2473520	and sometimes the unnatural can do good things,
2473520	2477360	but overwhelmingly, if you try to use the unnatural
2477360	2479160	for good, it's not gonna work out.
2479160	2483040	And so that was my thought for that whole arc.
2483040	2483880	Dope.
2483880	2485680	I can tell you why the overseer considered it
2486120	2486960	a success.
2486960	2490000	That giant is for sure the thing
2490000	2492400	that was on his mind the whole time.
2492400	2496080	Defeating that was his most solid of a goal,
2496080	2498360	at least when I got ahold of him.
2498360	2501040	So anything that doesn't hurt that effort is a success.
2501040	2502080	Yeah.
2502080	2503520	Exactly.
2503520	2507920	A wild gazebo asks, I think that story arc,
2507920	2512920	oh, they were adding on to what was said by Soren Ash.
2513600	2515520	They said, I think that story arc needs
2516240	2517080	the most explaining.
2517080	2520120	I love how just wild everything got,
2520120	2521680	but they didn't really investigate
2521680	2523640	and find out any of the plot points there.
2523640	2525080	Yeah, they were a little preoccupied
2525080	2528140	with all the shit that I was throwing at them constantly.
2528140	2531220	Wouldn't change that because it's a great in a way
2531220	2532800	to see it all go missed.
2532800	2536160	I just wanna know what any of that is about
2536160	2540100	and exactly how high did that girl end up going.
2540100	2542720	And ShamWow Chameleon, I can tell you,
2542720	2545040	got real, real high.
2546160	2547880	Did she grab a passing helicopter at some point?
2547880	2550560	She did, she got ahold of a passing helicopter,
2550560	2554200	got even higher and then in my mind,
2554200	2555240	into the rotors.
2555240	2557560	I think she probably just convinced
2557560	2562560	the helicopter pilot to keep going up and up and up.
2565480	2567800	That's what I like to think.
2567800	2572440	Got a thing from Jake Medrano, 911 says,
2572440	2574120	always love your stuff.
2574120	2576600	Hey, that's a big always.
2576600	2578000	Thanks.
2578000	2578840	What about this?
2578840	2581340	Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.
2581340	2583680	Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.
2583680	2584520	You love that?
2586400	2588120	Testing your boundaries.
2588120	2592120	He did say always and boy, we're still living in it.
2596780	2598060	My God.
2598060	2598900	Anyway.
2598900	2601040	Yeah, they say Sean McCoy,
2601040	2603840	who is the creator of Mothership,
2604440	2606400	which is a RPG game,
2606400	2608820	recently did an AMA where he mentioned
2608820	2611520	he loved your podcast and hope you eventually
2611520	2614600	did a adventure campaign of Mothership.
2614600	2616280	I've been looking for a good actual play
2616280	2617960	and would love to see you guys cover that.
2617960	2619960	Hope this finds you well.
2619960	2621220	I'm found well.
2621220	2622080	I'm found well.
2622080	2622920	Same.
2622920	2624480	Yeah, Thomas, you found well?
2625880	2626700	Yeah.
2629520	2631880	This is the question that Thomas was gonna lead us
2631880	2633560	through the answer of.
2634160	2637520	Because it is asking about Mothership and Sean McCoy.
2637520	2638840	And we are-
2638840	2639880	I don't know fucking shit about it.
2639880	2641040	He just asked me to look him up
2641040	2642540	and see if it was problematic.
2644280	2645520	As far as I can tell, no.
2645520	2646360	All right.
2646360	2647560	And as far as he can tell, no.
2647560	2649680	And that is a good thing.
2649680	2653880	So we are, with that being said,
2653880	2655560	we are super interested.
2655560	2657080	We would love to play Mothership.
2657080	2660200	It's, as far as I understand, a space RPG,
2660200	2661480	which we've all been talking about
2661520	2664020	if you wanna play a space thing sometime.
2664020	2665480	Yeah, we would love to play it.
2665480	2667240	Yeah, hey, Sean.
2667240	2669060	Take us to your GM.
2671140	2672520	Hey, Sean, hit us up.
2672520	2674680	That was a robot, but it was an alien.
2678060	2680960	Banstu says, for Thomas, Luke, Joe, and Justin,
2680960	2682200	uh-oh, I will-
2682200	2683040	Shut up, Zach.
2683040	2684440	Let us read it.
2684440	2686240	For Thomas, Luke, Joe, and Justin,
2686240	2688640	can you tell us what happened in season one?
2688640	2690320	Zach, how would you describe it?
2690320	2692320	Oh, this is a, all right.
2692320	2693680	So we're gonna cut to-
2693680	2697360	An hour each of recaps from all of us.
2697360	2699960	I think it would take even longer.
2699960	2701360	We're gonna skip this one.
2702600	2704840	My dude, it would not take me longer and an hour
2704840	2708960	to describe what happened in the season of this podcast.
2708960	2710640	I think as far as Keith goes,
2710640	2713560	what you saw was what was going on.
2713560	2716640	Wow, great answer from Luke.
2716640	2721120	Luke, what you heard is what you got.
2721120	2723760	Keith, he didn't like his brother, you know,
2723760	2726360	and then fast forward, Keith tension.
2726360	2727520	Justin doesn't need to be here.
2727520	2729680	That answer applies to all of us, but Joe.
2732360	2737160	I mean, did you guys expect the goo to when it grabs you
2737160	2738000	and slams you in the ground?
2738000	2739800	I didn't expect anything ever.
2739800	2740640	Did you?
2742880	2745280	Did you think that it killed you?
2745280	2746120	Yes.
2746440	2747800	I had a hunch that it was doing something
2747800	2749640	because we kept getting pictures from a place
2749640	2750480	that had no goo.
2750480	2752480	Yeah, no, it seemed like there was another goo place.
2752480	2753560	Yeah. Yeah.
2753560	2756840	But not at all formed like it was.
2756840	2757680	No.
2759400	2760800	It seemed way cooler to be honest.
2760800	2761880	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2761880	2762840	That's how it works.
2762840	2765240	Should have killed you before we got there.
2765240	2766200	Bansu also says,
2766200	2769960	can you go into a little bit of the goals of each faction
2769960	2771200	at the start of season one
2771200	2774200	and how those changed as things evolved?
2774240	2777280	One of the big changes that I decided to make happen
2777280	2780360	each time something unnatural occurred in the world
2780360	2784560	was that I would make Maggie Cook more aggressive,
2784560	2786600	angrier at her father,
2786600	2789960	and more dedicated to taking over the world
2789960	2793280	every single time something fucked up happened.
2793280	2796640	And so the Maggie Cook that you guys knew
2796640	2800600	would be different than the Maggie Cook that you talked to
2800600	2803200	anytime you ran into her for the rest of the time.
2803240	2806000	And that was attempted to be shown
2806000	2810360	through her setting up her own fake death,
2811560	2813280	where someone said like,
2813280	2814880	oh, she didn't stand up.
2814880	2818280	She didn't like hold herself the way that Maggie Cook would.
2818280	2819720	Like someone else was trying to,
2819720	2822280	Gary Daley was trying to throw like a slight hint there,
2822280	2823960	which you guys picked up on and were like,
2823960	2826200	okay, so it might not have been her.
2826200	2830680	If you guys had actually run dental through Randy Anx
2830680	2833440	with her teeth files on file,
2833440	2836800	you would have found out that the corpse was not the same,
2836800	2840080	did not have the same dental records as Chief Maggie Cook.
2840080	2840920	Gotcha.
2840920	2842240	And then when you ran into her
2842240	2845360	after your time at the Sydney Mausoleum,
2845360	2848520	you all kind of talked about how aggressive she was
2848520	2850240	and how angry she was,
2850240	2852720	which is different than we had talked about
2852720	2855040	her as a character being previous.
2855040	2855960	Right, which I was like,
2855960	2857440	yeah, the real Maggie Cook died
2857440	2858900	and this is a fake Maggie Cook.
2858900	2861300	Exactly, but essentially it was just that
2861300	2864100	each time something wild happened in this world,
2864100	2868060	you guys were the ones who were kind of split off
2868060	2870900	along with Stan Manstein, Mildred Mitchell,
2870900	2875620	certain people who continued on this specific timeline,
2875620	2877260	trajectory of contention,
2877260	2881620	as other people continued on the same path of contention
2881620	2882460	that they were on.
2882460	2883980	I forgot we were microdosing a lot
2883980	2885900	when you were writing this campaign.
2885900	2886740	Yeah.
2888900	2891020	Zach, were the time loops always planned?
2891020	2893900	No, did that come about due to the condition
2893900	2895540	the characters were in by that point?
2895540	2896620	Yes.
2896620	2897560	And the microdosing.
2897560	2898560	And the microdosing.
2898560	2900640	Also, Zach, I know you mentioned the possibility
2900640	2904020	if there was enough interest of writing up a setting guide.
2904020	2906780	So I wanna say I'd be interested in that
2906780	2910740	and TD underscore Woogie says seconded.
2910740	2914640	Hey guys, that is a goal that we are considering
2914640	2916080	putting up on the Patreon
2916080	2920000	if we're gonna put up a poll soon for patrons
2920000	2923000	to kind of let us know what they're wanting
2923000	2925160	from pretending to be people moving forward
2925160	2927920	and that will certainly be one of the options
2927920	2929960	of things that we should focus on
2929960	2932480	is writing up a campaign setting for contention,
2932480	2934160	which I think would be really fun
2934160	2939160	and also would take an astronomical amount of my time
2939360	2941400	and I would love to do that
2941400	2943680	if enough people were interested.
2943720	2947920	Edgeworth08 says, how different was episode 100 on
2947920	2950620	from what you initially thought the ending would come to?
2950620	2951960	How off the rails did it get?
2951960	2952800	Right on course.
2952800	2954920	Yeah, that's exactly what I planned.
2954920	2957440	No, we kind of talked a little bit.
2957440	2958720	We could talk about it with Justin
2958720	2962400	when he's on next episode about how I told you guys
2962400	2964600	I was trying to kill Don D. Pettymore
2966160	2967640	and it just didn't happen.
2967640	2971560	Yeah, when you guys were fighting against that rabid ball,
2971560	2975360	I really wanted to kill Don on the catwalks.
2975360	2979000	Yeah, that was the one role I ever lied about
2979000	2980240	and I feel pretty shitty about it,
2980240	2982280	but I don't actually because it got us, Justin,
2982280	2983480	through to the end, so.
2985040	2987040	But I fudged an unnatural success
2987040	2990560	because I didn't, I don't know why even.
2990560	2991800	I'm a weak man.
2991800	2996800	Oh, I wish that could have been the end of the episode,
3003880	3005880	but we have to get through more.
3005880	3010780	Okay, oh, so the answer is that it was very different
3010780	3011620	than I expected.
3011620	3015680	I wrote what was gonna happen in the next session
3015680	3017760	after we played the previous session.
3017760	3021080	I had literally nothing planned
3021080	3023640	and I planned as we played
3023640	3025980	through the end of the entire campaign.
3025980	3026820	Nice.
3026820	3027960	Yeah, that's honestly,
3027960	3031720	if you wanna know how I plan the entire fucking thing
3031720	3035680	and always have, I plan it based on what happened
3035680	3038180	the last session every time
3038180	3040640	because you can't just prep a bunch of stuff
3040640	3042160	and expect it to work
3043640	3044720	because it never does.
3045080	3045900	Nice.
3047260	3049180	What was the biggest takeaway you got
3049180	3050600	from making this podcast
3050600	3053920	and what did you learn to prepare for season two?
3053920	3055960	Shit's easy, make it up as you go.
3055960	3056800	Yep.
3057640	3059040	So more of that coming.
3059040	3063000	Yeah, the answer you just said from the previous question.
3063000	3066300	Yeah, but also for sure on season two,
3066300	3067720	gonna take your guys' advice.
3067720	3070160	I really liked the idea of, Thomas mentioned,
3070160	3073080	recapping what you learned from an NPC
3073080	3075040	after your interactions with them.
3075040	3077480	We love recaps around here.
3077480	3079680	I do that with combat, I realized,
3079680	3083000	where I kind of recap each round what happened in combat
3083000	3087000	and then thankfully later we had characters do it in game.
3088200	3090080	But yeah, I really liked the idea
3090080	3092880	of recapping what you guys get from NPCs.
3092880	3095640	Characters who would have never been there
3095640	3098400	if I hadn't heroically lied
3100340	3102600	while Zach tried to murder us on those catwalks.
3102600	3104700	Murder Justin on those catwalks.
3105560	3106400	Right guys?
3108520	3110520	Biggest takeaway from making the podcast?
3110520	3111480	Shit's easy.
3111480	3113320	Shit's easy, just make it up as you go.
3113320	3115160	Make it up as you go.
3115160	3116480	It was fun for me.
3117340	3120320	Editing is really hard and takes a long time.
3120320	3121160	Yeah.
3121160	3124460	And is really important.
3124460	3126280	Finally, I just wanted to say
3126280	3128560	that when I finally saw your faces,
3128560	3130720	I had a completely different image
3130720	3132760	from what you sounded like, except for Luke.
3132760	3135800	I thought, quote, yeah, that's about right.
3137320	3138240	It's, yeah, it's true.
3138240	3141240	I mean, we sound like normal people,
3141240	3145400	but we're all devastatingly attractive except for Luke.
3146560	3148280	No, they just could tell from my voice.
3148280	3149580	They're like that guy.
3149580	3150920	They say great stuff, guys.
3150920	3152760	What confidence that man has.
3152760	3154520	And I look forward to more content.
3154520	3157760	Tall idiot Milky Way at ShadowWorldVivo.
3157760	3158880	Oh, we're on Twitter.
3159840	3162080	It must have hashtag PTBPQ.
3162080	3163240	Love the podcast.
3163240	3165440	I've listened through all of it twice.
3167760	3169880	That's hundreds of hours.
3169880	3170720	Double hundreds.
3170720	3172060	Double, double.
3172060	3174240	What did the myriads mean at the end
3174240	3176600	when they were saying, quote, for your own safety,
3176600	3178880	please remain here?
3178880	3182360	Did they think shutting down Overseer and Ball
3182360	3183600	was a safe choice?
3183600	3184840	I was curious about this one too,
3184840	3185920	because on the re-listen,
3185920	3188320	you really hit home with that a bunch of times.
3188680	3190800	Was there a hint there that we didn't pick up on?
3190800	3193280	No, it was simply the thing that I kept hammering home
3193280	3195580	is that it's really fucking dangerous
3195580	3198960	for you guys to try to go back into the world
3198960	3201120	that Myriad was about to shut down,
3201120	3203380	was kind of the vibe that I was trying to give you.
3203380	3205240	Basically, find another option,
3205240	3209080	which you did in the weirdest way that I was not expecting.
3209080	3211200	But yeah, I was saying like,
3211200	3213920	if you go back to contention,
3213920	3216440	I am going to make you blip out of existence
3216440	3219760	because Myriad will erase your entire plane,
3219760	3222600	which includes all iterations of contention.
3222600	3223440	Sure.
3223440	3224540	I guess I assumed at the time
3224540	3226620	that also meant the place we were in, right?
3226620	3227460	The same.
3227460	3229280	Okay, I did too.
3229280	3231440	I thought for your own safety, please remain here.
3231440	3232560	We'll wipe you all out.
3232560	3234280	I was like, you're lying.
3234280	3235240	I thought it was a threat.
3235240	3237780	Nope, they were definitely gonna just leave you there.
3237780	3238620	Okay.
3238620	3241120	In my head, that's what I had planned.
3241120	3243280	That we could have lived in existence there.
3243280	3244120	Yep. Gotcha.
3244120	3245880	You definitely could have lived in existence there.
3246240	3247280	A great fun one.
3247280	3249080	So yeah, they were basically just saying,
3249080	3250080	for your own safety,
3250080	3254540	because jumping to a new plane is really hard.
3254540	3256120	And we kind of talked about that
3256120	3259040	after we recorded a couple of times where it was like,
3259040	3260160	what would have happened
3260160	3262480	if you guys would have tried to jump planes?
3262480	3266220	And I had a table that you would have rolled on
3266220	3269520	and the options were mostly bad.
3269520	3270840	Yeah.
3270840	3273120	My favorite that I was really pulling for
3273120	3278120	was going to be a very luscious, verdant, green jungle
3279280	3281160	that then you all would have slowly died
3281160	3285200	of radiation poisoning and maybe at the jaws of dinosaurs.
3285200	3287400	So yeah, there were different places.
3287400	3289440	Well, that's not my favorite.
3289440	3291200	That you could have ended up
3291200	3292040	if you had to try to leave.
3292040	3294840	Gazebo, a wild gazebo says,
3294840	3299260	I for one look forward to our new lives under Keith's rule.
3299260	3302840	I'm sure he'll be a kind and a holy empathetic leader.
3303400	3306200	All hail Keith's, hallowed be thy name.
3306200	3307040	Hallowed be thy name.
3307040	3308280	Looks like the Keiths myriad
3308280	3310360	have taken over some Twitter accounts
3310360	3313800	and are spreading some disinfo.
3313800	3314800	Bless you, my son.
3315800	3318700	Lynn is spooky at Jet Sedette says,
3318700	3321040	shout out to the handsome boy, Luke.
3321040	3325360	Hashtag HZKMP, hashtag PTBPQ, smiley face.
3325360	3326600	Keep it up.
3326600	3329320	Another Keith on Twitter.
3330440	3331800	Who is that really, Keith?
3331800	3332840	I don't know who that is.
3332840	3335920	Sasha Snow, one of our fantastic mods,
3335920	3338240	at MariexLupin says,
3338240	3343240	so when y'all releasing the hot dog cut of No Backbone.
3343320	3345320	Amazing job on season one.
3345320	3347800	I can't wait for the next season to kick off.
3347800	3349160	We can't either.
3349160	3350360	We're excited for everything
3350360	3351480	that's coming down the pipeline.
3351480	3353480	Super stoked, super stoked.
3354360	3356880	I'll release the hot dog cut of No Backbone
3356880	3359880	with the permission of Kudzu on Patreon.
3360440	3362600	I'll actually, that's a great question.
3362600	3365840	I'll hit up Seth, who's the lead singer of Kudzu,
3365840	3369800	and see if he's cool with me releasing the hot dog cut,
3369800	3373240	which he will not know what I'm talking about.
3373240	3375560	So I'll send it to him and then we'll,
3375560	3378840	thankfully the season's over, so he can't pull out now.
3381080	3386040	Kyanite fuck cars at 1312 Kyanite asks,
3386040	3388560	do y'all have a secret to not getting burnt out
3388600	3391800	on the same story, adventure, system, et cetera,
3391800	3394320	other than reasonable and restful breaks?
3394320	3398480	Those are for babies and I am no baby.
3398480	3400640	I am a baby, I took a break.
3400640	3401480	We took big breaks.
3401480	3403000	We took a big break, yeah.
3403000	3404080	We took a couple of big breaks.
3404080	3406880	We started recording this season in contention
3406880	3409920	a full year before we started releasing,
3409920	3410920	we've said a few times.
3410920	3414320	So I mean, there were many breaks in there,
3414320	3417440	but I'm curious, did you guys ever feel burnt out
3417440	3418480	on the story?
3419360	3420760	No, because it just changed.
3420760	3422000	It was a consistent thread,
3422000	3423840	but so many other things where it's like.
3423840	3425720	We had the luxury of those mini arcs also
3425720	3426560	to break it all up.
3426560	3428880	Actually, yeah, by the time we got to the numbers
3428880	3431920	and everything without a lot of even hints
3431920	3433920	about what was actually going on.
3433920	3437520	Yeah, that arc was, I mean, like about that
3437520	3438720	in the world in general.
3438720	3440920	Though I don't know if you guys had more than I did
3440920	3442920	at that point with your characters.
3442920	3444280	I didn't know anything.
3444280	3446920	Joe is definitely learning that he was the overseer
3446920	3447800	during that arc.
3447840	3450520	And so that was a very Joe centric.
3450520	3452600	There was also a moment where the entire story
3452600	3456040	could have changed because Leon wanted to take me elsewhere
3456040	3457840	and I had some kind of role that I succeeded
3457840	3458800	and or failed on.
3458800	3461440	He said, you know what, let's not do that yet
3461440	3464040	and let's do the city campus first.
3464040	3465600	If I had gone to the other place,
3465600	3466840	I guess we're in spoiler territory.
3466840	3469560	He wanted to take me straight to Comcomfy Campground
3469560	3470520	and meet up with Maggie.
3470520	3473400	Meet up with Maggie who was waiting for you on the shore
3473400	3478400	with a heavy metal box that would have summoned
3480480	3484000	the Gigantum Barpithecus into the world of contention
3484000	3487800	and her plan was alongside the overseer, you,
3487800	3490400	was to hold the world hostage
3490400	3495000	and literally take control of a one world government.
3496680	3498960	You guys could have had a very different overseer.
3500680	3503080	Yeah, I mean, obviously I love the story that we crafted
3503720	3504560	but that's way better.
3506880	3509360	So secret to not getting burnt out, I guess,
3509360	3512320	is just to keep the story fresh and moving
3512320	3514440	in different directions constantly.
3514440	3517160	That makes me remember that also even after the fact,
3517160	3518520	when I came back from one of the loops,
3518520	3521280	I was trying to convince them to go to Comcomfy Campground.
3521280	3523120	We had another chance to have done that.
3523120	3527440	I was also planning on that happening, yeah, for a while.
3527440	3532440	Spine Bazinglingter at Putnam Puppeteer says,
3532480	3535440	it seemed that there was an uneasy truce
3535440	3539080	between the Circle of Knowledge, Coq, Myriad
3539080	3542120	and the majority of factions in the series
3542120	3545880	with the possible exception of the Glass Syndicate.
3545880	3549760	Was this unity an allied powers-esque counter
3549760	3551880	to MARY's agenda?
3551880	3556320	No, MARY was the allies and everybody else was the ISIS.
3556320	3557160	Yeah.
3559240	3560480	Yeah.
3560520	3563800	I like to think that Myriad and the Circle of Knowledge,
3563800	3566560	Bar Corp, they were all kind of working together.
3566560	3568520	You had an NPC kind of say that one time
3568520	3570960	that they're all moving in different ways
3570960	3571800	toward the same goal.
3571800	3574720	Yeah, and Love was talking to you guys about that
3574720	3578000	outside of Beans Pond and that is true.
3578000	3580640	MARY was not a part of that agenda.
3580640	3583780	Everyone was pretty confused about the balls
3583780	3587440	and how they work and no one had a grasp on it
3587440	3589000	was my thought process.
3589400	3592040	There are a couple other balls that are out there
3592040	3595960	in this world that were never found
3595960	3598600	and I never wrote anything for them
3598600	3600240	because I didn't. Make it up right now.
3600240	3601480	Didn't think I needed to.
3601480	3602480	They're out there, baby.
3602480	3603840	Yeah, they're fucking out there though.
3603840	3606680	If you do the math, there were a certain amount
3606680	3609680	of successes, Kacelle knocked out a certain number of them,
3609680	3613380	John was one of them and yeah, the math doesn't quite add up
3613380	3615880	there's one or two I think that are left out.
3615880	3616720	Nice.
3616720	3617560	And so they're still doing this stuff.
3617560	3620080	Take some time to feel your spine right now.
3622680	3625840	Also, keep in mind if you're stoned
3625840	3628240	and you're listening to this and it's late at night
3628240	3630920	and it's dark and you're in your house by yourself,
3630920	3632000	don't look out the window
3632000	3633360	because there's someone looking at you.
3633360	3636640	Yeah, and your ball.
3639760	3641520	That's right, Derek.
3641520	3644620	There's someone looking at you through the window.
3645300	3649620	Also, Tyler, shut your door right now, then lock it.
3651620	3655700	Xylopia or, well, no, it's gotta be that, right?
3655700	3656660	Xylopia maybe?
3656660	3657620	Oh yeah, probably.
3657620	3658860	Xylopia.
3658860	3661340	Question, what can you tell us about season two?
3661340	3662180	Nothing.
3662180	3663000	Nothing.
3663000	3663840	Nothing, but we are talking about it.
3663840	3664680	Who the fuck told you that?
3664680	3666520	I'll tell you about season two.
3666520	3668100	How do you know about that?
3668100	3669540	How do you know about season two?
3669540	3671060	That wasn't supposed to leave this room.
3671060	3671900	Codename season two.
3671900	3672740	I think it's worth saying
3672740	3674380	that you've done a lot of work on it already.
3674980	3675820	Yeah, it is.
3675820	3679180	It's worth saying that I remembered a couple months ago,
3679180	3681460	contention in the main story and everything,
3681460	3684980	like with the NPCs that would be moving parts
3684980	3688420	were all written out well before we started recording.
3688420	3691780	And I was like, oh shit, I gotta get on this.
3691780	3695700	So I've had the idea rumbling around in my head
3695700	3698380	for season two since, I would say,
3698380	3701220	when we were recording episode 12.
3702260	3703220	Nice.
3703220	3705920	And I've kind of fine-tuned it.
3705920	3709020	Taylor has worked as my story supervisor
3709020	3712180	to basically me talking out loud
3712180	3713720	and her being like, that doesn't make sense.
3713720	3714560	Let's fix that.
3714560	3715580	And so. Nice.
3715580	3717900	Yeah, I'm really, really fucking excited about it.
3717900	3718740	So that's what we can tell you.
3718740	3720300	What were you watching a lot of at that point in time?
3720300	3722460	Oh, that's a good question.
3722460	3723940	What was I watching?
3723940	3724860	Gilligan's Island.
3724860	3726960	Fucking one show you were so into.
3728960	3730020	Whoa.
3730020	3731220	The magic thing.
3731220	3732060	Oh. Who?
3732060	3733900	Mr. Strange, wait, what was it?
3733900	3735060	Jonathan Norrell?
3735060	3737440	Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.
3737440	3738280	Yeah.
3738280	3739100	It's pretty good.
3739100	3740240	Yeah, I think it's really fun.
3740240	3745240	There's a Faye, and I'm not really super into Faye lore,
3746900	3749740	but I really like that story.
3749740	3752580	And the acting is really solid in it.
3752580	3753860	Yeah, definitely.
3753860	3757360	Dirk Gilligan had a lot to do with season one.
3757360	3760820	John dies at the end, had a lot to do with season one.
3760820	3761660	A lot of stuff.
3762140	3764340	Anytime I'm watching media or listening to media,
3764340	3765820	I'm stealing.
3765820	3768900	Question, would you guys ever consider playing a season
3768900	3773300	of Scum and Villainy or some other spacey flavor
3773300	3774420	of tabletop role-playing?
3774420	3775380	C Mothership.
3775380	3776900	Yeah, C colon Mothership.
3776900	3778060	Yeah, for sure.
3778060	3779660	I've heard Scum and Villainy is dope.
3779660	3782140	Is Scum and Villainy the Star Wars one specifically?
3782140	3784980	Yeah, I think it is not name brand,
3784980	3788260	but it is essentially, do you want to role play Star Wars?
3788260	3790300	This is a way to do it.
3790300	3791140	Cool.
3791620	3793500	And I would, you know what I would call it
3793500	3794660	the whole time we were playing it?
3794660	3795840	What?
3795840	3797420	Scum and Villainy.
3797420	3798260	Oh, okay.
3800540	3801880	Zach, oh, okay.
3805780	3808780	Compliment, this is one of my favorite podcasts.
3808780	3813220	PTBP is my only Patreon subscription at the moment.

3823340	3825020	It's going up and up and up and up, baby.
3825020	3827780	Diamond hands on PTBP.
3827780	3829980	That's right, you hold.
3829980	3830980	It only goes up.

3834100	3835660	1KL Island.
3835660	3837620	No, 1K Island.
3837620	3841300	Oh, 1000 Island Stare, 1000 Island Stare.
3841300	3843260	Yep, 1K Island Stare.
3843260	3844100	Come town joke.
3844100	3847060	Says, what was Maggie Cook's agenda?
3847060	3849300	What was the schism in the circle of knowledge?
3850060	3851500	Really all about.
3851500	3854980	Her relationship with her father depreciated in value
3854980	3857280	every single time something unnatural happened
3857280	3861220	and that is what led her to come up with the idea
3861220	3865980	to dethrone him and take over the circle of knowledge.
3865980	3867920	So there were unnatural things happening
3867920	3870580	before we blipped into existence as characters.
3870580	3871420	That is correct.
3871420	3874500	Because we found a bunch of notes about that schism
3874500	3875820	happening previous to us.
3875820	3876780	Gotcha, cool.
3876780	3878020	Yeah.
3878020	3880100	Modern Cannabis asks,
3880100	3883060	what was the deal with Joe's parents?
3883060	3884580	Why did they get the book?
3884580	3886760	What was the deal with their hinting him
3886760	3889380	about letters slash Wheel of Fortune?
3889380	3891660	I may just have spaced something.
3891660	3894620	What happened the day Joe was in the library?
3894620	3896440	I don't know what the deal with Clark's parents is,
3896440	3897780	but what's the deal with Joe's parents?
3897780	3900620	Like Joe's parents, it's a whole ass episode.
3900620	3904260	Yeah, we would need some time.
3904260	3906500	You'll have to ask why they got the book
3906500	3907780	or answer why they got the book.
3908380	3911020	I can tell you what I think of as the day in the library
3911020	3916020	was Clark Old, the overseer, protecting young Clark
3916340	3917660	and knowing that that was a timeline
3917660	3918780	that needed to continue.
3918780	3921240	And that's why he chained the doors closed
3921240	3924020	and created a distraction, a diversion
3924020	3929020	to get the myriad away from those doors.
3929360	3931300	Oh my God, dude, that was so cool.
3933700	3936820	I just threw the vague back to Luke and mid answer,
3936860	3940760	Joe just like snagged it out of the air one handed
3940760	3944660	and then handed it to Luke and continued answering
3944660	3947020	until we couldn't hold it in anymore.
3948700	3950380	That was good, because it was like,
3950380	3951520	really good answer though.
3951520	3955380	And the deal with Joe's parents is just simply,
3955380	3957860	they had the book, don't fucking worry about it.
3957860	3960860	It's called the McGuffins.
3960860	3961900	Yeah, exactly.
3961900	3964180	My own thoughts on the way that his story,
3964180	3966340	that Clark and the overseer storyline ended
3966780	3970580	is that he was gonna go back and put the pieces in place
3970580	3973780	that then set them in motion to end up where they ended up.
3973780	3975940	So the book had to end up with Joe's parents.
3975940	3977060	Is that a TV trope?
3977060	3978180	With Clark's parents.
3980180	3982180	And yes, you're 100% right about the day
3982180	3984320	that Clark was in the library as a child.
3984320	3987100	That is exactly what the overseer was there to do.
3987100	3991140	But the overseer was always being chased by myriad.
3991140	3993740	So let me hit the ATM.
3994300	3998740	A great user name, says, well done guys.
3998740	3999580	Thank you.
3999580	4000400	Thanks.
4000400	4001240	Thanks.
4001240	4002080	Thank you.
4002080	4002900	It's been a fun ride.
4002900	4003740	Thank you.
4003740	4004580	Thank you.
4004580	4005400	Thanks.
4005400	4006240	Thank you.
4006240	4007300	My question is, what, if any,
4007300	4010220	meaning did the actual vocal portion of the spells
4010220	4011180	throughout the show have?
4011180	4013320	Like, were they a specific language?
4013320	4016900	Did they mean something aside from the spell?
4016900	4018600	And the answer is slightly.
4019620	4023460	Yeah, I used a Google translate to take words
4024020	4027220	that I thought were meaningful to the spell.
4027220	4032060	And then I Google translated them into fucking Swedish
4032060	4036080	and then Arabic and then French and then Spanish
4036080	4039240	and then Indonesian and then Dutch.
4039240	4041940	And just like somewhere along the line,
4041940	4044700	pulled out a syllable or two that I liked
4044700	4047160	and then did it with the next word
4047160	4049420	that also worked toward that spell.
4049420	4051880	So if it was like time backwards,
4051880	4054280	then I would do it with those two words
4054280	4057280	and then put those combination of syllables together.
4057280	4058960	And that's how I came up with the spell.
4058960	4059800	Yeah.
4059800	4063480	So that's how we used hyper geometry in season one.
4063480	4068480	And I've been working on my magic engine for season two.
4069880	4072040	And I'm pretty stoked about it.
4072040	4072880	So.
4072880	4074840	And I did the same with to do hakanu.
4077640	4081220	Bacon Monkey says, listener from Thailand here.
4081620	4082460	Thank you.
4082460	4083280	Whoa.
4083280	4084120	That's awesome.
4084120	4084960	Very cool.
4084960	4086200	And I love season one and congratulations
4086200	4087940	on finishing it on such a high note.
4087940	4088780	Thank you.
4088780	4089600	Thank you.
4089600	4090440	Thank you.
4090440	4091280	Thank you.
4091280	4092100	Thank you.
4092100	4092940	Thank you.
4092940	4094220	My question is a bit more pertaining
4094220	4095460	to the behind the scenes stuff,
4095460	4097220	but I wanted to know how you guys approach
4097220	4099020	the various topics or directions
4099020	4101100	that the characters will go through.
4101100	4103420	I know a lot of the twists were surprises
4103420	4106960	and I was wondering if you guys had to talk beforehand
4106960	4109380	regarding what topics to avoid
4109380	4112700	or if certain subjects were too sensitive for some people,
4112700	4115580	or if a player didn't like a certain direction
4115580	4118140	that the handler took their character down
4118140	4120580	because it seemed like everyone took all the surprises
4120580	4124100	in stride and strove to continue the story with them.
4124100	4126060	And that really stood out to me.
4126060	4128740	Excuse my shitty English, which.
4128740	4129580	Your English was great.
4129580	4131980	Your English was phenomenal.
4131980	4134980	Alc underscore the underscore missed also added
4134980	4136300	your English is fine.
4136300	4139260	Thanks for popping in there to reassure
4140100	4140920	this poster. Thanks.
4140920	4141760	Yeah, for sure.
4141760	4144420	So let's hit some of these points in here.
4144420	4146420	We do talk about some stuff before,
4146420	4147660	like, do we want to, like,
4147660	4150140	we discuss some content beforehand,
4150140	4152500	not necessarily like surprises that are going to happen
4152500	4154360	to the characters that keeps that from us,
4154360	4157500	but like we have pretty like serious
4157500	4159540	and thoughtful discussions about what we do
4159540	4160900	and don't want on the show.
4160900	4161740	Yeah.
4161740	4163320	We definitely have one-on-ones with Zach too
4163320	4164780	that are like, hey, here's what I'm thinking.
4164780	4165620	Exactly.
4165620	4166440	He'll do that.
4166440	4168020	Like I want to kind of do this with your character maybe
4168020	4168860	or whatever.
4168860	4169680	Yeah.
4169680	4170900	Which even pre-recording,
4170900	4172940	I specifically remember one day at work,
4172940	4176460	I was, I texted all three of you when I was working
4176460	4181460	the shitty job and I took my lunch break so seriously.
4182780	4184720	And I would, I was at the time,
4184720	4186620	I was just spending my lunch breaks,
4186620	4191500	reading every post on the R slash Call of Cthulhu
4191500	4194380	and R slash Delta Green subreddits.
4194380	4196100	I went to top all time.
4196100	4199480	And I read for like 10 pages on both of those,
4199480	4203260	just consuming as much content as I could
4203260	4207280	to try to try to get more info on how to be good at this.
4207280	4212220	But I texted you guys something about your characters
4212220	4214620	and Joe texted me back immediately.
4214620	4218180	And then we literally started like role-playing
4218180	4221860	like a solo thing with his character over text message
4221860	4224700	on my lunch break to prepare for like the next session
4224700	4225540	that was happening.
4226180	4227020	So sick.
4227020	4231460	Yeah, okay, you guys sexted, that's good brag.
4233460	4235340	There's also a part of the question that says,
4235340	4236860	if a player didn't like a certain direction
4236860	4239380	that the handler was taking their character down,
4239380	4242160	I never felt that way, but I also always felt comfortable
4242160	4243520	if I needed to, to tell you that.
4243520	4245580	I think you were receptive to anything we said.
4245580	4247040	And I think there have been a couple of moments
4247040	4248420	where we're like, I don't,
4248420	4249940	I can't think of anything in particular,
4249940	4252840	but it does feel like maybe we've done that.
4252840	4256220	Yeah, I feel like at least before we recorded,
4256220	4257960	there might've even been a couple of times
4257960	4259480	where just mid campaign,
4259480	4261340	you might come up to me and be like, hey.
4261340	4262180	I'm Irish now.
4262180	4263020	I'm Irish now.
4264480	4266600	Meaning to talk more about it in character,
4266600	4270860	if you could kind of prompt it in the role-playing.
4270860	4273420	Like Joe said, that's my hope obviously,
4273420	4275720	is that you guys feel comfortable coming to me
4275720	4278800	with any concerns that you have.
4278800	4280880	There's nothing so sacred that I would feel
4280880	4282040	like I couldn't say, hey,
4282080	4283660	I don't know if this is what I want.
4283660	4286700	I hope you feel comfortable coming to me,
4286700	4288600	Zach lustily texted Joe.
4291160	4295300	Luke and Thomas read Joe and Zach's sex ASMR style.
4297400	4299360	Yeah, that's the ultimate Patreon goal.
4299360	4300900	Yeah.
4300900	4303880	And then as far as like hot topics go,
4303880	4306520	we've been friends for a long time and like-
4306520	4307560	We all know kind of.
4307560	4310000	Yeah, we know our boundaries, I think.
4310000	4311860	Oh yeah, we also wouldn't be friends
4312620	4314500	if we didn't have like the same general values.
4314500	4315980	Yeah.
4315980	4319300	I like respect you guys as people.
4319300	4320140	Yeah.
4320140	4322660	And I wouldn't, if you were gonna joke about stuff
4322660	4324180	that I wasn't comfortable with.
4324180	4325300	Yeah, for sure.
4325300	4326540	All people as people.
4326540	4328140	Exactly, which is-
4328140	4330140	It's a really, really basic concept.
4330140	4331900	It's like so simple.
4331900	4336600	It's just like really, really easy and super cool to do.
4338740	4340260	Jacob pegging, nope.
4341860	4345500	I see where you're going for there.
4345500	4346660	Jacob pepping.
4346660	4349300	Pepping, Jacob pepping just says,
4349300	4352220	love the show, only actual play to really grab me
4352220	4355940	and drag me down into the ooze and never let me go.
4355940	4356780	Thank you.
4356780	4357620	Thank you.
4357620	4358440	Erotic.
4358440	4359280	Yeah, that's great.
4359280	4361680	If everyone had to pick a moment from the show,
4361680	4362520	what would it be?
4362520	4365980	Coolest, funniest, most memorable, or just most nuts?
4365980	4367520	There's tons.
4367520	4368740	Most recently.
4369300	4370940	Yeah, man.
4370940	4371980	The Keith turn.
4371980	4375420	I think the Keith turn had us all like dying.
4375420	4376260	It was incredible.
4376260	4377300	That was nuts.
4377300	4380340	Yeah, that was so fucking insane.
4380340	4383300	That was a really, that was a really good one.
4383300	4384620	The death of Anne Love.
4384620	4387180	I was gonna say that for me, for sure.
4387180	4390020	Really important, the way that that all went down
4390020	4391940	and the fight with John and Clark,
4391940	4396940	like the roles just happened the way that told a fun story.
4397240	4398080	Yeah.
4398280	4402240	I really loved the robot fight we had.
4402240	4404600	I was like, dude, this is sick.
4404600	4406440	That was one of the most intense things, I think,
4406440	4408540	like as a player that I felt like-
4408540	4409560	Are you talking about in the house?
4409560	4410580	Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
4410580	4412200	Where I was like, oh, we're gonna die.
4412200	4413040	Like this is-
4413040	4414520	Yeah, yeah, right, totally.
4414520	4416320	I don't know how to fight this robot.
4418040	4420720	Your guys' eyes, like each of your eyes,
4420720	4423360	when I described the top half of that robot
4423360	4425080	breaking off from the bottom half,
4426000	4429320	probably like put another plus five years
4429320	4431920	of role-playing for Zach, like.
4431920	4432760	Yep.
4432760	4434280	I'm chasing those eyes.
4435120	4436600	I saw the look in their eyes
4436600	4437440	and I've been chasing that feeling ever since.
4437440	4439280	And you gave us just an old man
4439280	4441040	shitting himself the whole time, too?
4441040	4441880	Yeah.
4444300	4447400	Not the plan I had for Randy Angst.
4447400	4450840	You guys were so aggressive about the guns with him.
4452600	4454360	That seems like so long ago.
4454360	4458400	It was so long ago we did that, but that was dope.
4458400	4460120	Thomas, is there like a moment
4460120	4462640	from the season one of pretending to be people
4462640	4463980	that when you think about the show,
4463980	4466720	like reaches out to you as a particular moment?
4466720	4468800	No, I'm way more into the later seasons.
4470360	4473000	Well, for me, for you as a role player,
4473000	4475080	I can think of two specifically.
4475080	4478720	One, Martin Cupertino, trying to convince the group
4478720	4482680	that he was in the right about where to go
4482680	4483780	when you guys were in the woods
4484140	4485340	and looking for the door.
4485340	4490340	And you had a much lower skill in survival
4491400	4493100	than the alternative,
4493100	4497060	which was the archeologist played by Joe.
4498060	4498900	Whose name was?
4498900	4499720	I don't remember his name.
4499720	4500560	I don't either.
4500560	4501400	I don't either.
4501400	4503660	And it was not Angela.
4503660	4505340	Angie, Angie, Angie.
4505340	4507600	Which that cracked me up when I was like,
4507600	4509300	hey, can I name your wife, Angela?
4509300	4511840	And you're like, yeah, whatever, whatever you want to do.
4512840	4515040	And then I was like, ha ha ha.
4515040	4518040	It's Anne Love, motherfucker, mommy fucker.
4518040	4520280	If I remember right, did that reveal happen
4520280	4522240	off the podcast, didn't it?
4522240	4523080	To me.
4523080	4524720	Oh, I think it might've.
4524720	4526040	I think it might've.
4526040	4529760	I think I wasn't recording when you put two and two together.
4529760	4533760	Gloating three AMS, by the way, idiot.
4533760	4534840	Idiot.
4534840	4536960	Shouldn't have let me name your wife.
4536960	4539640	And then the other one for Thomas is,
4539720	4541320	when you decided that,
4541320	4544560	when you passed a sanity check in the Old West Arc
4544560	4548480	and you said, no, I don't want to be sane,
4548480	4551520	and then just grabbed the head of the preacher,
4551520	4554000	chair of Dr. Bobby Custard,
4554000	4559000	and started moving his mouth and talking through his head.
4560860	4561980	That was another.
4565480	4566560	Thanks.
4566560	4568680	And then additionally, I'll throw up one more
4568720	4571320	just because we're on the topic and I'm thinking of it.
4571320	4574680	When you threw Drew Andrews against the wall,
4574680	4577040	when it was just me and you,
4577040	4579560	and you threatened his life.
4579560	4580880	Oh, yeah.
4580880	4585020	If he fucked you over on the cocaine deal,
4585020	4587680	that was really intense.
4587680	4588520	By the way, Drew-
4588520	4591080	I just thought about what I would do to you, Zach,
4591080	4594500	if you tried to screw me out of our cocaine deal.
4594500	4598220	Drew was not adamant,
4598220	4601940	but he did throw out the idea top of like,
4601940	4605260	okay, so this much money split four ways.
4605260	4608500	And Thomas was like, no.
4610500	4611360	Two ways, Drew.
4612800	4614660	Drew was definitely, in my head,
4614660	4617860	like I thought I was going to be able to rope all of you
4617860	4620340	into being the worst fucking cops.
4621180	4623140	Oh, which you did on your own for the most part.
4623140	4624560	Keith would have probably been in,
4624560	4627320	but then when we found Fergie Beans,
4627320	4629500	it might've just instantly gone to gunfire.
4629500	4630860	Oh, that would have been-
4630860	4632020	That would have been really cool.
4632020	4634520	That was the reveal that I was hoping for
4634520	4636900	is the four of you out there for a drug deal
4636900	4639520	and then Keith's fucking brother shows up
4639520	4643020	with a van full of android kids.
4643020	4646980	At the same time, imagine the Keith that we know
4646980	4649220	is essentially the villain of this whole story.
4649220	4651700	Definitely the villain of this whole story.
4651700	4655260	Getting like a million dollars and some change
4656340	4659380	to fund those dreams earlier than, you know,
4659380	4660980	then he might've otherwise realized them.
4660980	4663300	I don't think it's a, it wouldn't be prudent.
4663300	4665460	It wouldn't be prudent.
4665460	4667820	To quote a relevant and popular sketch
4667820	4669840	from a relevant and popular show.
4671420	4675280	A highlight of Keith was being Silas Cole.
4675280	4678780	Yes, that was super fucking fun.
4678780	4681260	The orchestration of his brother's murder.
4681660	4683580	Yeah, that was really fucking good.
4683580	4687400	Your Wild West character was also fantastic.
4687400	4690560	Ephraim Corland and then the turn that Ephraim
4690560	4693140	got to take where you got got first
4693140	4696180	and then were able to take them down
4696180	4699740	is another key role-playing moment that-
4699740	4701140	That was great.
4701140	4703260	That actually is like, I was like,
4703260	4706300	oh my fucking God, I'm such a goddamn idiot.
4707700	4709180	I'm the dumbest man alive.
4709620	4711980	Man, being a player is fucking hard.
4711980	4714540	Come on guys, come on in and look at this.
4715860	4720780	Like in D&D, you literally played the hero of the story
4720780	4725060	and you know that like the story is on your side.
4725060	4728540	Right, in Delta Green, you're not like supposed to win.
4728540	4730700	No, anything you do.
4730700	4732560	This is why DMs like it so much
4732560	4735780	because it's literally like, yeah, like maybe they'll win,
4735780	4736900	but it's still gonna let you get
4736900	4738300	your sick little rocks off.
4740180	4742180	That's why he brought bringing us back.
4742180	4745020	He still gets to tell the man, really do it somehow.
4745020	4746660	It's like, I killed him, yes.
4746660	4748060	Oh no, what have I done?
4749540	4750860	Post kill clarity.
4753700	4756100	I gotta bring him back, I gotta bring him back.
4756100	4757300	Load up the mausoleum.
4760180	4762340	So thank you all so much for listening
4762340	4763460	through this first Q&A.
4763460	4765060	We're gonna do one more to finish out
4765060	4767420	the rest of these questions that everybody asked.
4767460	4770060	I think we got through exactly half of them.
4770060	4772060	Yeah, hell yeah, we got through exactly half
4772060	4773920	and we'll come back with Justin next week
4773920	4777500	to answer the remaining questions that you all have
4777500	4779180	and thank you.
4779180	4780020	Thanks for listening.
4780020	4780980	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
4780980	4782820	If you've listened this far, whoa.
4782820	4784100	Whoa.
4784100	4787760	Yeah, whoa and also do tune in next week
4787760	4789420	with the exciting conclusion
4789420	4792460	of the question Zach was gonna ask us.
4792460	4794980	Oh yeah, I haven't been teased it.
4794980	4797300	By the way, I've been meaning to ask you guys.
4797640	4798940	I'm gonna eat a woman, a woman.
4799440	4800580	Sorry, sorry."
4800580	4801500	I know you really can't.
4801500	4804240	Another one, there's a scene where you videos
4804240	4806460	pace game sort of tennis cinematography.
4806460	4808540	That's different from competing to competing.
4808540	4811220	It would be insane if we missed several videos
4811220	4813300	with some contradictoryuns.
4813300	4815640	I thought that was just funny to me too.
4815640	4817080	That's right, we got O Edge on theMoment.
4817080	4818460	What do you think about O Edge?
4818460	4821700	O Edge, the moment of that edict Jesse
4821700	4823040	or whatever your point is,
4823040	4824580	where'd the audience go?
4824580	4832340	How am I the only one trying to fool all?
4832340	4841340	How can you have enough drowning out of the notes?
4841340	4847340	There's no point in going.
4847340	4855340	No point going.
4855340	4858340	Fly to fly to stream.
