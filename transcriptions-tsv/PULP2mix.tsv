0	9240	Hello to all my friends from the underworld, the overworld, and the in-between world.
9240	17040	It's your multi-dimensional devilish demon wolf the dog, and I'm also a radio DJ for
17040	24240	the station we all know and love, 694.2 PTBP.
24240	32000	And I'm here to provide you with ear cream in the form of my beautiful soul tree voice.
32000	38080	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is the cream of the ear crop, and it's from TLN in Kansas
38080	44840	City, who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod, a nice thing you can do
44840	48360	right now, like super easily.
48360	52360	Thanks TLN in Kansas City, TLN writes.
52480	58840	Hello wolf, and thank you for the ceaseless howlin', keepin' me company upon these
58840	60400	dayless moors.
60400	68080	TLN here from Kansas City to give a shout out to the very vilest viziers whose creative
68080	72960	powers have wrought upon this world great and terrible things.
72960	81120	Because of you we have unleashed the weird and wild, the book of gob, the thawing kingdom,
81160	88320	marvelous mutations and merry musicians, and very soon the world shall behold the dreadful
88320	93120	sunny smiles unicorn farm and unicorn meat.
93120	99600	May the pig king remain at rest, may the seven finger hand reach to the ends of the earth,
99600	102640	long live the vile viziers.
102640	107400	Damn TLN, you had me at unicorn meat.
107400	114200	I generally consider myself a vegetarian, but I dabble in some minced mythical meat
114200	116200	every now and again.
116200	122600	Thanks for writing whatever the fuck all that was TLN, I appreciate it, even if I don't
122600	126320	know what in the ever lovin' fuck any of it meant.
126320	130840	If you want to write up something for your wolf to how, tag us on the internet or write
130840	134360	up a five star review on Apple podcasts.
134360	136560	The links are in the show notes.
136560	139440	The sausage links are in the gross throats.
139440	142880	On the golf links I have the most strokes.
142880	145920	Fuck Mark Zuckerberg it's time for the news.
145920	152280	Last time we met the disguised Lafayette J. Honeycutt, a rival inventor who has snuck
152280	159960	into Cicero Mordaunt's New Year's Eve party to unveil his own mysterious invention with
159960	166380	his security detail Harvey Brewer, an absolute hulk of a man.
166380	173680	We also met Checkers, the oddly deep voiced 19 year old leader of the Last Branch, a cult
173680	180400	hoping to recruit the wealthy and powerful with the disarming charm of Checkers and the
180400	187720	spiritual potential of Elden Ring, an open vessel seeking otherworldly knowledge.
187720	191520	Will the Last Branch gain a key third member?
191520	200200	Will Honey J. Laugh-a-cut, aka James Dean, aka Dave Ellington, figure out what the deal
200200	207720	is with Cicero Mordaunt's new invention that requires all these cables and antennae?
207720	213120	Will Scott admit that Elden Ring is a perfect character name?
213120	214860	Come on down.
214860	217780	No one sane will follow.
217780	223620	It's the renowned Isabel Crane with Hollow.
244860	259820	With a tissue and a faggot bone You were hollow and you spoke to me
259820	273380	Hollow and you sang I thought you might be starving
273380	283220	So I gave you everything
283220	286700	Did you like that, Scott?
286700	291860	I think it helps focus the mind before a session, so yeah.
291860	295740	We try to do a lot of stuff that helps focus the mind before a session.
295740	299740	What do you do, Luke, to get into the mindset of a role-playing session?
299740	304580	Wake up, roll out of bed, and sit down on the couch.
304580	308540	What about you, Scott?
308540	309540	Maybe a different answer?
309540	314980	No, that's pretty much it for me.
314980	316540	I don't do any prep for anything.
316540	324020	I mean, if I'm GM, you're lucky if I read the fucking scenario.
324020	326940	I'm so jealous of your skills.
326940	333260	I over-prep so hard for everything, and I talk to myself in character voices, and my
333260	341300	wife asks me how I'm doing, and I'm like, fine.
341300	344980	I worked out a while back that I was absolutely shit at character voices, so I don't really
344980	347300	try them anymore.
347300	351260	I feel like you give them vocal affectations even though you don't do accents.
351260	353540	Yeah, I try.
353540	358100	I don't try full voices, but I try to differentiate them a bit.
358100	364700	Also, for us, you already have a built-in character voice.
364700	368700	But it's the wrong fucking accent for everything I've run for.
368700	374260	Hey, Scott, will you run some stuff that's only set in America for us?
374260	378180	No, the next one is he's going to force us to do English accents.
378180	381340	The next time, we'll all do English accents.
381340	382340	Oh, God.
382340	383340	Hey, Scott, would you like an accent?
383340	387260	That would be so much less fun for him.
387260	389340	It'll just be Beatles and Cockney accents.
389340	390340	Yeah, that's cool.
390340	391340	We're the Beatles.
391340	396780	It's taking me something like 30 years of living in England to get the hang of this
396780	397780	already.
397780	398780	Don't confuse me.
398780	400780	I'm Ringo, isn't it?
400780	402780	Is that good?
402780	403780	Wow.
403780	404780	Yep.
404780	406780	There we go.
406780	412220	Well, we were talking weird science.
412220	414100	What's your favorite weird science movie, Thomas?
414100	416540	Oh, I like that movie, Weird Science.
416540	417540	RDJ?
417540	421960	What's the Val Kilmer, is it Young Genius?
421960	422960	Real Genius?
422960	423960	Yeah.
423960	424960	Something like that.
424960	425960	Real Genius.
425960	426960	Real Genius.
426960	427960	Yeah.
427960	428960	I like that one.
428960	429960	Oh, God.
429960	430960	I haven't thought about that film since the 90s.
430960	431960	Why do you know it, Joe?
431960	435460	It was one of those movies that would run on HBO when I was a kid.
435460	439820	It's just perfectly childish enough that I was into it.
439820	440820	Yeah.
440820	444100	Did you know that your parents letting you watch HBO at a young age made you who you
444100	445100	are today?
445100	446100	Yeah.
446100	447100	Definitely.
447100	448220	Did you ever see boobies on there?
448220	449780	Taxi cab confessions all the time.
449780	453780	That's why I am the way I am.
453780	455780	Obsessed with boobies.
455780	458820	Were there nipples on taxi cab confessions?
458820	462700	Sometimes, if you were lucky, if it was a good episode.
462700	466820	You know, if the driver was shirtless.
466820	475060	Scott, when you were coming up, what was the thing that was scandalous that you hid
475060	478500	from your parents that you were looking at?
478500	479940	Oh, God.
479940	486240	Oh, this has got to be a deep cut and very obscure, but I think the inappropriate media
486240	492040	that I encountered at a fairly young age that shaped me and my parents really didn't like
492040	497520	when they encountered it was a book called Image of the Beast by Philip Jose Farmer,
497520	504860	which is a science fiction novel come sort of new Irish thing that was published in the
504860	507460	60s or 70s.
507460	517200	And it is basically just somewhere between bizarro fiction and outright pornography.
517200	519060	It's one of the weirdest books ever written.
519060	525600	It is insanely on brand for that to be a fact.
525600	528520	To give you an example of the kind of book it is.
528520	534100	One of the characters in this is Gilles de Rais, AKA Bluebeard, but it's not the classic
534100	535100	Gilles de Rais.
535100	541760	He's been reincarnated and he now lives as this snake-like entity living in the womb
541760	544480	of one of the female characters.
544480	550480	And his shtick basically is every time she has sex with anyone, he comes out and just
550480	554880	bites the cock of the person who's having sex with her and kills him.
554880	557920	Oh my God, that's great.
557920	558920	Well thanks a lot, Scott.
558920	563680	I didn't need to know I was into that too.
563680	569860	I had a VHS of Double Jeopardy and there's a sex scene in that movie and I would just
569860	570860	watch that.
571260	576180	I thought you meant like you had taped an episode of Jeopardy and you're like, there's
576180	577900	a sex scene in this Jeopardy.
577900	581620	I was just thinking, I don't remember Trebek ever working with me.
581620	584020	This was Tommy Lee Jones.
584020	585020	Let's go to...
585020	587660	I'm like, Joe, I didn't have to hide anything really.
587660	591040	So my parents exposed me to a ton of media and stuff.
591040	596260	They were separated, so my dad was a little more permissive about what I got to watch.
596260	599340	Well, like a lot more permissive.
600340	604900	And so South Park came out in 1996, I think.
604900	605900	Oh my God.
605900	606900	I was...
606900	607900	30?
607900	608900	I was 30, yeah.
608900	613300	I was seven years old and my dad was like, hey, there's this show I think you're going
613300	619620	to really like, but you can't tell your mom you watch it when you're over here.
619620	624180	And so for a few years, South Park was a secret, but that was literally the only thing I had
624180	626460	to not tell one of my parents about.
626460	631420	When I was six years old, my mom also said the same thing to me, hey, there's this show
631420	633900	that's coming out and I think you're going to like it.
633900	634900	It's called VeggieTales.
634900	635900	It's Pokemon.
635900	640900	I thought you were going to say the Left Behind movies.
640900	646240	I did read all the Left Behind books and it gave me night terrors.
646240	651160	And so in order to fix me, my parents prayed for me.
651160	652160	It didn't work.
652160	653500	It was just anxiety, guys.
653500	655820	It was just anxiety the whole time.
656260	657260	Yeah.
657260	658260	Oh my God.
658260	659260	Religion.
659260	660260	Religion.
660260	661260	It's a hell of a drug.
661260	662460	Let's do some lines.
662460	665460	It's pretending to be people.
665460	668060	I Googled it and I was eight when South Park came out.
668060	669540	Oh wow.
669540	671500	That is young to watch South Park.
671500	673500	I was probably nine by the time he showed it to me.
673500	677980	I'd already been watching The Simpsons since I was literally born and I was obsessed with
677980	678980	it.
678980	682020	And he was like, if you like The Simpsons, you're going to fucking love this shit.
682020	687180	I'm not going to say how old I was when South Park came out.
687180	688660	I was four years old.
688660	689660	Oh fuck.
689660	693940	I was 32.
693940	696380	You'd already lived so much life, Scott.
696380	697740	So how did South Park hit you?
697740	700220	All right, let's kick into...
700220	701220	Appropriately.
701220	702220	Yeah.
702220	705700	The target demographic.
706700	708820	All right.
708820	716820	Last time on Pretending to be People, we played Colputhulu.
716820	718820	Colputhulu.
718820	720540	Colputhulu.
720540	721540	Actually the P is silent.
721540	724740	It's just Thulu.
724740	729180	We introduced our characters and made it to the party and kind of got acquainted with
729180	731340	the goings on of what's happening at the party.
731340	734380	Can we give a quick rundown of our names and our characters real quick?
734380	735380	Thomas?
736060	738540	Jay Honeycutt, a gentleman inventor.
738540	743820	I'm Harvey Brewer and I'm here to protect him and make sure nothing happens to him.
743820	746860	Checkers, leader of a fantastic organization.
746860	753020	It's a cult and I'm Elden Ring and we're trying to change the world through the powers that
753020	756180	exist between mind spaces.
756180	759020	We got government officials, we got...
759020	763180	We're going to bag ourselves a senator and a movie lady.
763180	764180	Star of...
764180	765180	Favorite movie she was in.
765180	768500	Oh, probably Last Train to Jacksonville.
768500	769500	Clarksville.
769500	770500	Nope.
770500	771500	She did a whole series.
771500	772500	Last Train series.
772500	775260	Yeah, they're some of my favorites.
775260	781220	I like the rom-com First Train to Love Town.
781220	790220	And yeah, we went to the party and currently I believe Thomas, Jay, Edgar, Honeyfella and...
790220	792140	What is your guy going by here at the party?
792140	793260	David Ellington.
793340	794340	David Ellington.
794340	798700	David Ellington and Harvey Brewer are checking out the radio antennas that are strangely
798700	803620	sticking out of kind of like the front of the house and also the tower that seems to
803620	805500	have been built outside of this estate.
805500	808460	Yeah, I think we're turning around to pick up our coats from Kochek.
808460	809460	Yeah.
809460	811420	You guys are going back out in the cold.
811420	816020	I'm standing in the warm about to talk to a senator about the world.
816020	817660	I think that's a good point to pick up from.
817660	818660	Yeah.
818660	819660	There we go.
820060	826860	Eldon was making his way through the crowd.
826860	830580	Say the last name, Scott.
830580	833540	I like to go by first hand last names.
833540	837660	Brought to you by From Software.
837660	840380	Mr. Ring was making his way through the crowd.
840380	841380	Oh, get it?
841380	844860	Because it's like mystery, but it's also my name.
844860	845860	What is your name?
845860	846860	Sekiro.
846860	847860	Halo 3.
848060	856460	So, yes, Mr. Ring is making his way through the crowd, trying to home in on the senator.
856460	861980	But before you get a chance to, there is a woman who's been making her way through the
861980	862980	crowd as well.
862980	867340	I think she's, you reckon, probably in her mid 40s.
867340	869900	She's got fairly frizzy reddish brown hair.
869900	872500	She's got thick glasses on.
872500	875740	She's wearing a bald gown that doesn't quite fit.
875740	879700	Like a number of the guests here, she looks a bit flushed and drunk.
879700	883980	She just comes up to you and grabs you by the hand and says, you look like a dancer
883980	887180	and immediately sort of whisks you off and starts dancing with you.
887180	889840	Well, yes, thank you so much for that.
889840	896140	And he begins dancing with her and says, you look absolutely wonderful.
896140	897140	Oh, thank you.
897140	900060	Oh, you are a darling little man, she says.
900060	901060	Oh, yeah.
901060	904340	He's looking up to her as they're dancing.
904380	906340	His feet are on her feet, like.
906340	912980	Yeah, you got a good view straight up at her buck teeth and nasal hair.
912980	916260	And she's swinging you through the crowd.
916260	918580	What brought you here this evening, my dear madam?
918580	922220	Oh, I'm here with the Harvard contingent, you know.
922220	923820	Oh, very good.
923820	926340	Are you expecting much from the party tonight?
926340	928340	Not really, no.
928340	930660	Champagne, the occasional dance.
930660	931660	Psychic attack!
931660	932660	Psychic attack!
932660	933660	Psychic attack!
943340	945140	How does the psychic attack work?
945140	946140	What is the...
946140	948660	Did you just perform a psychic attack?
953340	958860	Scott, Zach had his hand raised for a psychic attack.
958860	959860	He thought it so loud.
959860	966060	So you tell me if I'm wrong here, but I believe we roll a power contest against each other.
966060	967060	Yeah.
967060	970660	So is your goal basically just to get it to go away at this stage?
970660	971660	No.
971660	979620	So my goal is to continue dancing with her while basically intimidating her into continuing
979620	986560	dancing with me while I completely eliminate all of her magic points and she comes under
986560	987560	my thrall.
987560	989060	Is this how you get cult members?
989060	990060	Yes.
990060	991060	Holy shit.
991060	998260	So yeah, then give me a power roll, I shall roll against you as an opposed roll.
998260	1002780	Well I passed with a 62 under a 90.
1002780	1004260	Regular success.
1004260	1009380	So if you psychic attack me at some point, we'll be doing a power roll off?
1009380	1013060	Yeah but I'm trying, I don't want to psychic attack you.
1013060	1015060	Okay, she failed.
1015060	1017060	Oh, sick.
1017060	1025060	Well, you say that, but there's something weird that happens when you do this.
1025060	1032900	I mean you basically use the tricks that you've honed to try to take control of her mind and
1032900	1039160	you realize as you're doing this, someone's beaten you to it.
1039160	1044940	You're trying to grasp hold of her will, but it's like it's already in the thrall of something
1044940	1046240	else.
1046240	1050600	You could give me, I'd say, another power roll here to see whether you can deduce what's
1050600	1052360	going on.
1052360	1053360	That is a success.
1053360	1054360	59 under 90.
1054360	1060320	Yes, as you try to grab hold of her mind with yours, you're looking into the darkness.
1060320	1064600	You're looking into the darkness that is enveloping her mind.
1064600	1071520	Try to find something, anything to hold onto and there is something in the darkness there
1071520	1073480	with you.
1073480	1081240	You can just hear this growling voice from all around, this sibilant growling voice that
1081240	1084240	just says, mine.
1084240	1089000	Give me a sand roll if you want.
1089000	1090880	I got chills a little bit.
1090880	1093920	I will absolutely give you a sand roll, fuck.
1093920	1098400	Yeah, in real life I lost sand.
1098400	1104520	So as far as sanity goes, I have 90 because my power and I rolled a 63.
1104520	1109480	Okay, so you don't lose any sand for this, but it probably still gives you enough of
1109480	1119960	a start that it breaks you out of the psychic trance that you were going into to do this.
1119960	1123720	The woman looks at you strangely and says, are you all right?
1123720	1126640	Yes, ma'am, what is your deepest desire?
1127160	1129280	I thought you were going to say, what's your deal?
1129280	1132280	What's your deal?
1132280	1135200	She looks at you strangely, my deepest desire.
1135200	1139880	Oh, I suppose I really want to see Cicero's invention.
1139880	1142040	I want to see it succeed in every way possible.
1142040	1144680	It's got to change the world, you know.
1144680	1145680	Interesting.
1145680	1147200	Do I also believe that?
1147200	1149360	Um, up to you.
1149360	1151560	Sounds like it already has.
1151560	1156360	Ma'am, tell me anything more that you know about this wonderful invention that will change
1156400	1157400	the world.
1157400	1160080	I too am interested in learning about these things.
1160080	1161320	Oh, yeah, of course you are.
1161320	1163480	I mean, it's going to be the most wonderful thing ever.
1163480	1165080	It's got to change the world, you know.
1165080	1166080	Yes.
1166080	1167080	What will it do?
1167080	1169480	It's got to change the world.
1169480	1170920	Incredible.
1170920	1172600	Everyone here has been brainwashed.
1172600	1173600	Okay.
1173600	1177560	Uh, he is going to go back in.
1177560	1181360	He's going to try to like get in and then fucking fight.
1181360	1185120	Like once he's in her mind space, he wants to punch up.
1185120	1191760	Oh, so what are you effectively trying to use her as a conduit to get to whatever has
1191760	1192760	got to her first?
1192760	1196720	Yeah, I'm playing, uh, what's that lawn game with the balls?
1196720	1197720	Croquet?
1197720	1199920	Yep, I'm using her as the, uh-
1199920	1201920	You're playing psychic croquet.
1201920	1202920	Yep.
1202920	1208200	I prefer psychic curling.
1208200	1212720	Psychic croquet sounds amazing, but how are you playing psychic croquet with her?
1212720	1216960	Okay, so you know when one of your croquet balls gets up against somebody else's croquet
1216960	1222080	ball, so then you put your foot on your croquet ball and smack it and then it shoots theirs
1222080	1223480	off in a crazy direction.
1223480	1229000	I'm smacking her and the point is to make the movement happen on the other side of her.
1229000	1230000	I like this.
1230000	1231000	You make that work.
1231000	1232000	I do like that.
1232000	1233000	Yeah, I like that a lot.
1233000	1238600	Just as an aside, I'm pretty sure I saw psychic croquet open for Hawke when she needed it.
1238600	1246960	Psychic croquet, holy shit.
1246960	1249560	So I rolled power again and I got an aught 5.
1249560	1253320	Okay, let's see what your opponent gets here.
1253320	1254800	So you've got an extreme.
1254800	1255800	Yes.
1255800	1256800	I see him.
1256800	1260560	I think that might help me with my double jump up to punch this guy's butt with his
1260560	1264700	mind in his space, he's a silly goose, he doesn't know who he's messing with, he's messing
1264700	1266100	with Elden Ring.
1266100	1270940	He's got an extreme as well and his power is significantly higher than yours.
1270940	1272340	Oh, damn.
1272340	1280860	This time you're in her mind trying to shunt through to this other mind and it's almost
1280860	1286800	like there's no resistance and yeah, you can push through her mind and connect with this
1286800	1288860	thing that's on the other side.
1288860	1294740	And then you realize this only happened because it let you.
1295080	1298780	And suddenly you feel like a rat in a trap.
1298780	1302780	I'm in danger.
1302780	1308140	There is something that has just seized hold of your psyche and I mean, even if you want
1308140	1310200	to try to pull your mind back, you can.
1310200	1311200	Checkers, where's checkers?
1311200	1317680	Yeah, as this is happening, I come out of the bathroom and I am coked up and had slammed
1317680	1318680	like three drinks.
1318680	1323400	So I'm feeling pretty wild, but I see him dancing and not talking to the senator and
1323400	1324680	I am not very happy about that.
1325120	1330420	Not only dancing, but I read in the book that if you fail these checks or if someone is
1330420	1335540	looking and paying attention to the face during a psychic attack, they're contorted in pain
1335540	1336540	and confusion.
1336540	1344200	Oh, it's worse than that here because what checkers sees as he comes back from the bathroom
1344200	1351860	is that Mr. Ring has broken off from the dance.
1351860	1357400	The woman who was leading him through the crowd now seems to be standing over him.
1357400	1363000	You see Eldon just fall to the ground with a heavy thump and she's standing over.
1363000	1365280	Are you all right, mister?
1365280	1367200	And at least you think that's what she's saying.
1367200	1369560	You could barely hear her over the band.
1369560	1375080	And there are a few other people who've stopped their conversation and now gathering around.
1375080	1380800	Yeah, there's Eldon lying on the ground, his eyes rolled back into his head.
1380800	1386700	As I see this, I approach, I'm like, everybody stand back.
1386700	1390800	And I pull out like a little vial from my pocket.
1390800	1391800	It's like smelling salts.
1391800	1396020	I like put it under his nose like this happens all this has happened before for sure.
1396020	1397020	And I'm like prepared.
1397020	1401340	I'm going to have that because I have the resourceful talent.
1401340	1402340	Oh, nice.
1402340	1403340	Sure.
1403340	1404340	Oh yeah.
1404340	1405740	If you want to spend 10 points of luck for that, that's perfect.
1405740	1412760	I would, uh, I'll just not spin the points.
1412760	1417320	I know I can do that, but yeah, I want to do that and basically like snap him out of
1417320	1418320	it.
1418320	1423400	And as you do so, I mean, there is a hand that comes down on your shoulder and as you
1423400	1430000	look around, you can see that there is this clergyman who you've seen moving through the
1430000	1435660	crowd before when he's got a fairly thin face and graying temples, he almost chiseled
1435660	1437340	good looks.
1437340	1443580	He gives you a concerned look looking down at Eldon as well and says, uh, is your friend
1443580	1445140	quite all right there?
1445140	1450500	He's got a very sort of cut glass English accent says something I can do to help.
1450500	1451700	It happens all the time.
1451700	1456700	He's got a condition, but this bad boy right here usually snaps him right out of it.
1456700	1459140	Oh, well I suppose you better do that then.
1459280	1466600	Uh, yeah, so I, I smell salt Eldon, uh, and I'm like, but like, I'm like looking at the
1466600	1474300	clergy guy while I'm doing it mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, Eldon.
1474300	1475300	What happened?
1475300	1477340	I mean, actually, no, you have a condition.
1477340	1478600	This happens all the time.
1478600	1481760	Don't tell me what happened right here in front of this guy.
1481760	1482760	Yes.
1482760	1485800	Perhaps we better get your friends somewhere quiet.
1485800	1486800	Who are you by the way?
1486800	1487800	Oh, I'm sorry.
1487800	1489080	That's terribly rude of me.
1489080	1490080	I'm Reverend Nye.
1490080	1493260	I earned this whole deal.
1493260	1494260	Thank you, Reverend.
1494260	1495260	Uh, Reverend Nye.
1495260	1496260	Is it Bill Nye?
1496260	1497260	Is it Bill Nye?
1497260	1499100	Uh, Reverend, thank you.
1499100	1500900	I think Eldon, are you good?
1500900	1505320	I think I don't know that I want to be isolated at the party unless you feel like you need
1505320	1506320	it.
1506320	1510140	I'm sure we can find somewhere quiet just for him to recover his senses.
1510140	1516520	He gestures at one of the serving staff who's going past and just says some water for this
1516520	1517820	young man here.
1517840	1521040	Thank you, Reverend Man of the Cloth, sir.
1521040	1526280	I would like to look into his eyes and try to get a read on him.
1526280	1530880	Yeah, I was going to say, is there like a human type, uh, skill?
1530880	1531880	That's psychology.
1531880	1532880	Psychology.
1532880	1533880	Perfect.
1533880	1536480	Can I psychology this guy to see why he's trying to isolate us?
1536480	1537480	Sure.
1537480	1538480	Yeah.
1538480	1540480	38 on a 60.
1540480	1541480	Okay.
1541480	1544380	It's going to have to be a hard success, so you'd have to spend eight points of luck to
1544380	1545380	make that.
1545380	1546380	Do it.
1546380	1547380	Let's do it.
1547940	1548940	Minus 18.
1548940	1549940	Yeah.
1549940	1553540	I went down 10 for the smelling salts and now I am at 32.
1553540	1562020	There is something about his manner for all the urbaneness that strikes you as being terribly
1562020	1563340	predatory.
1563340	1565500	Master Checkers, should I trust this man?
1565500	1573380	Well, we always trust men of the cloth, but it's a party, so sorry, but no rest tonight.
1573380	1574380	That's right.
1574380	1575380	Sorry.
1575380	1576380	It's a party.
1577380	1587660	And, uh, I, I help Eldon up off the ground, miss, uh, Reverend I nice to meet, nice to
1587660	1588660	meet you.
1588660	1592420	Maybe we can catch up later, but we've got an important business to attend to and I kind
1592420	1594260	of gesture towards the Senator.
1594260	1600020	He smiles at you and says, of course, of course, but we must talk later.
1600020	1603020	I'm sure we have great things to discuss.
1603180	1608540	Well, if you read this, uh, you know, you'll, you'll know what I'll be wanting to talk about
1608540	1609540	later.
1609540	1611220	And I hand him one of my pamphlets.
1611220	1616780	He takes it and immediately scans it and flicks through it and says, oh, how wonderfully droll.
1616780	1619480	And then tucks it into his pocket.
1619480	1624340	Checkers is coked up and he has just created a shit list and this guy is at the top of
1624340	1628140	it.
1628140	1637340	Before you lead Mr. Ring away from the Reverend, Eldon can give me a SPOT HIDDEN, if...
1637340	1638700	74 on a 25.
1638700	1644500	So you lead Eldon away from the Reverend who turns around and starts making small talk
1644500	1645500	with someone else.
1645500	1646500	Okay.
1646500	1650740	And yeah, we'll, we'll head towards the Senator Billings.
1650740	1652580	Okay.
1652580	1655060	So we'll come back to you in a few moments.
1655060	1660340	Let's cut back to our scientific investigation team outside.
1660340	1662540	Newly, newly outfitted in their coats.
1662540	1663540	Okay.
1663540	1668580	So you've gone back inside, you've managed to get some coats, uh, they might even be
1668580	1669580	your own.
1669580	1671580	Their tongues have warmed up to body temp again.
1671580	1672580	You're right.
1672580	1676580	We found some, we got some better coats.
1676580	1678580	Does this look good on me?
1678580	1683220	Um, so yeah, we are, we are trudging back.
1683220	1686580	Lafayette wants to go see this tower.
1686580	1687580	Come along, Avi.
1687580	1689140	We've, we've got to get to the bottom of this.
1689140	1693140	Uh, and I believe the bottom of this is at the top of that tower.
1693140	1694140	I get it.
1694140	1695140	I get it.
1695140	1697580	You're saying that this thing points at that thing, so it must be related there.
1697580	1703300	You know, my last several men were much dumber than you and they didn't appreciate my wit.
1703300	1705380	And so you're, you're a delight, Avi.
1705380	1706860	It is a delight to have you along.
1706860	1708340	Well, I've got your back.
1708340	1710620	Well, I, well, I got your back.
1710620	1711620	There it is.
1711620	1712620	There it is.
1713020	1714020	It's easy to do.
1714020	1718020	Now, now forward, Avi, for science.
1718020	1720020	Yeah, we're, we're making our way to that tower.
1720020	1727020	Making our way to the tower, walking slow cause it's snowing and cold.
1727020	1730340	You mentioned, you mentioned to think of it as kind of like a watchtower.
1730340	1734300	Is there forestry around it or is it kind of standing on its own in a field?
1734300	1739900	It's standing on the edge of this plateau that makes up the, the compound, the sort
1739900	1744020	of grounds of the manor house and the outbuildings.
1744020	1748380	So it does overlook some woodland, but it's not actually in the woodland.
1748380	1749380	Gotcha.
1749380	1750380	Sure.
1750380	1754540	When you get up to the top of it, is it like one that kind of has like a like porch around
1754540	1758860	the outside and you like walk through a door into a building or is it just like open on
1758860	1759860	the top?
1759860	1765020	Well, you're going to have to, I think, get a bit closer to really see the top of it.
1765020	1767020	Luke's trying to fast forward.
1767700	1772780	Yeah, because it's now snowing so heavily that even by the time you get to the bottom
1772780	1777940	of it, the top of it in the darkness and the snow isn't really visible.
1777940	1782200	There is a ladder that goes up to the center of it.
1782200	1783460	So there's not stairs.
1783460	1785940	It's just like a ladder that goes up to, okay.
1785940	1789900	I don't want to ruin the reveal, but if we used my invention right now, we sure could
1789900	1790900	get there a lot faster.
1790900	1793240	And it gives Harvey a knowing, like wink.
1793240	1794420	Does Harvey know what's in the case?
1794420	1795420	He does.
1795420	1797220	I'm going to show you, Joe, but I have it written down.
1797220	1798220	I just hadn't had the moment to-
1798220	1799220	Does Scott know?
1799220	1800220	No, Scott doesn't know.
1800220	1801220	Nope.
1801220	1803220	I am a quiver with anticipation.
1803220	1805220	Scott doesn't know.
1805220	1807220	Don't tell Scott.
1807220	1814140	No, it's just, I took the gadget talent and chose this gadget.
1814140	1819420	Cicero Mordant is going to eat fucking crow when he sees my cool ass gadget.
1819420	1824780	Oh, you hypnotized a bunch of fucking assholes at your mansion?
1824780	1828060	Well, I can't say anymore, but you'll see.
1828060	1829780	I think he can fly.
1829780	1833220	I gathered some sort of levitation device.
1833220	1834220	Levitation device?
1834220	1835220	No.
1835220	1837980	Are you guys coming louder or what?
1837980	1840460	So were you, yeah, was that what you were intimating?
1840460	1842540	Is it we're going to use it or we're not?
1842540	1843540	No.
1843540	1844540	Gotcha.
1844540	1847740	It's not at the time, Harvey, but so they keep trudging on through the snow towards
1847740	1848740	that tower.
1848740	1850540	And you mentioned some outbuildings.
1850540	1855780	Are they like a groundskeeper's house or is it more like industry, like science-y?
1855780	1860580	No, I mean, that said, I mean, you do know that there is an outbuilding around the back
1860580	1865980	of the manor house, which is Mordant's laboratory.
1865980	1874980	But the ones that you're passing on your way to the tower, there's some old stables, there's
1874980	1881580	some garages, there's this building, which, yeah, maybe a groundskeeper's cottage or something
1881580	1885900	like that, where there does seem to be a party going on for the chauffeurs.
1885900	1889020	None of it is necessarily related to the weird science.
1889020	1890580	No, not that you can see.
1890580	1895820	I mean, the only building that you can think of that might have anything to do with that
1895820	1898540	is Mordant's laboratory, but you haven't been there yet.
1898540	1902580	Well, I mean, this time, but that is where I fucked his wife.
1902580	1903580	Jesus.
1903580	1907740	Yeah, he hates me.
1907740	1911820	At the bottom of this tower, is there any of that stuff that we can see on top?
1911820	1914700	Are there wires or anything coming down the legs of the tower?
1914700	1917660	There are no wires down here.
1917660	1924820	It is basically just a wooden frame with some metal supports and a ladder going up.
1924820	1929060	The ladder is slightly iced over, but as long as you're careful going up and down, you should
1929060	1930060	be fine.
1930060	1934020	Keep your tongue away from it.
1934020	1936220	You don't have to lick everyone.
1936220	1937220	I vote we go up.
1937220	1943500	I thought you were going to say, I vote we lick everyone.
1943500	1949700	Yeah, I'm sorry.
1949700	1952420	I was imagining we're licking everyone.
1952420	1959980	Okay, so yeah, Harvey, actually, no, Lafayette definitely orders Harvey up there first.
1959980	1963380	Yeah, for sure, I'll start climbing up.
1963380	1964380	Okay.
1964380	1967420	Yeah, you make your way up and it is about a hundred feet tall.
1967420	1970780	Harvey looks down and goes, yep, most of them are cold.
1970780	1976900	Oh, do, do, hurry, do hurry, Harvey, and then throw down a rope.
1976900	1980380	Seems more difficult.
1980380	1986220	The higher you get, the more aware you are of how strong the wind is as the snowstorm
1986220	1989380	is building up and the snow is getting quite heavy.
1989380	1995220	But you make your way up and there's a trap door in the bottom of the platform that's
1995220	1996220	up there.
1996220	1999860	But, I mean, if you try it, it's not locked, you can just push it open.
1999860	2002580	Okay, I do that, I pop my head up.
2002580	2008980	And inside, it's dark, but you can see what looks like maybe electrical equipment and
2008980	2014220	some maybe work benches or consoles or something like that, a lot of wiring.
2014220	2020700	But up above, on a separate platform above you, you can just make out the outline of,
2020700	2025460	yeah, maybe you've seen something like this before, it looks pretty incongruous, but it
2025460	2032180	looks like the kind of huge light or bulb or whatever that you'd see in a lighthouse.
2032180	2033260	Oh, wow.
2033260	2038300	Why just spill your beans?
2038300	2041740	I kind of report down to the Lafayette, are you staying at the ground or were you coming
2041740	2042740	up the ladder behind me?
2043260	2048300	I mean, he's 100 feet down below in high winds, you're not going to be able to shout down
2048300	2049300	to him.
2049300	2054180	So he's peering up and as soon as he sees Harvey peek his head up and get in there and
2054180	2059540	not be immediately eviscerated or thrown back down, he starts climbing up after him.
2059540	2061020	You make your way up.
2061020	2066820	It is a bit of a tricky climb at times, again, because of the high winds and the icy rungs,
2066820	2069420	but you make it up there.
2069420	2077020	And sure enough, you are inside this cabin atop the tower that's got glass windows that
2077020	2079900	are rattling a bit in the high winds.
2079900	2086780	You can see outside in the darkness the shape of a variety of aerials poking out.
2086780	2094140	There seems to be a lot of wiring inside and yeah, this light up above you.
2094140	2099300	You know how that one aerial outside on the house was pointed up at this tower?
2099300	2100300	What?
2100300	2102980	I'm sorry, Zach?
2102980	2104980	He said aerials poking out?
2104980	2111420	Yeah, he said aerials poking out and Zach looked at me and started playing with his
2111420	2118300	nips and was like, uh, uh, uh, and then you said aerials again and it just really sounds
2118300	2123060	like aerial is, so yeah.
2123060	2128020	Did the nipples that we saw earlier, are they, uh, is there any more of them from our vantage
2128020	2129020	point now?
2129020	2130580	Are there any more on the house or anything?
2130580	2137940	Give me a spot hidden, Raul, because you are looking through heavy snow in the dark.
2137940	2140260	I pass a 21 on a 70.
2140260	2143580	Oh, so that's a good, that's a good situation.
2143580	2150060	So looking around, as you scan around the main house and the outbuildings, no, the only
2150060	2155980	aerial you can see is the one that is directly above the ballroom, but you do see something
2155980	2156980	else.
2156980	2164540	And just for a moment in the darkness, you think you see something moving in the snow,
2164540	2171280	a large shape is impossibly as up in the air, almost as high up as you are, just moving
2171280	2174580	fast through the air, a dark shape.
2174580	2175580	And then it disappears.
2175580	2177460	Is it going in a certain direction?
2177500	2180540	It seems to be heading towards the house.
2180540	2181540	Good question.
2181540	2182860	But I've lost sight of it at this point.
2182860	2185700	Yeah, because there isn't any light up here.
2185700	2187020	It's dark and it's snowy.
2187020	2191780	Harvey is just pointing to where he last saw it and trying to get Luffit's attention.
2191780	2196280	Uh, boss, there was a thing and, uh, use your words, man.
2196280	2197280	What did you see?
2197280	2199260	I saw a big thing up in the sky over there.
2199260	2202900	It was, uh, it was, it was moving, it was moving fast, but I did, I lost sight of it.
2202900	2204100	It was heading for the house.
2204100	2206480	A big thing moving towards the house.
2206480	2207480	How big?
2207480	2212760	It's really difficult to say because there wasn't really anything to give you a sense
2212760	2214760	of scale as it moved past.
2214760	2218640	You think it might've been human size, but you're not sure.
2218640	2220600	We didn't, we didn't pass anyone, Harvey.
2220600	2223040	What did, what do you think you saw?
2223040	2225600	It had to have been a, you know, a boy, a boy.
2225600	2226600	It was a boy.
2226600	2227600	Nevermind.
2227600	2228600	It was just a boy.
2228600	2230640	A boy was, it was in the air.
2230640	2231960	It was, it was big though.
2231960	2235520	It was bigger, bigger than I picture most boys, but it had to have been a boy.
2236040	2240200	What else would it be up at the same level as us at this point?
2240200	2250480	Lafayette is, um, is thinking hard and tapping his suitcase, but he doesn't open it yet.
2250480	2253600	So is Lafayette taking a look around at the equipment here?
2253600	2258600	Yeah, he's going to start investigating what Mordant was up to in here, what he can deduce
2258600	2259720	that this place is for.
2259720	2260720	Okay.
2260720	2267280	Have you a choice here as to whether you use engineering or electrical repair to try to
2267280	2269000	work all this out?
2269000	2270840	Those are dead even scores for me.
2270840	2271840	Okay.
2271840	2276760	I think for flavor's sake, he's, he's looking at the electronics around here and following
2276760	2281440	wires and trying to see what is connected, you know, to what device and what it might
2281440	2282440	be for.
2282440	2285040	He's probably using both skills to be honest, but he's, you know.
2285040	2288800	But if you get an ordinary success, you'll be able to work out most of it.
2288800	2291400	If you get a hard success, I'll give you something extra.
2291400	2293200	I got a 54 on a 90.
2293200	2294200	Oh, close.
2294200	2295200	You could spend nine.
2295200	2297880	You could spend nine points of luck.
2297880	2298880	You'll learn a bit more.
2298880	2299880	Do it.
2299880	2300880	I will do it.
2300880	2301880	Nice.
2301880	2302880	Good.
2302880	2309120	I'm, I'm all about whittling down that luck, preferably to get you below 30.
2309120	2312080	Oh shit.
2312080	2313480	I forgot.
2313480	2314720	Can you explain why?
2314720	2315720	Okay.
2315720	2322760	In pulp Cthulhu, you can survive certain death, so you could have, yeah, you could be on top
2322760	2323760	of this tower.
2323760	2329280	It catches fire and the, the falling structure collapses down into the forest below.
2329280	2334040	Yeah, almost certainly killing anyone, but as long as you have 30 points of luck or more,
2334040	2338600	you can spend all your luck in one go and survive that certain death and just narrate
2338600	2340800	how you managed to get out of the situation.
2340800	2341800	Okay.
2341800	2344840	As soon as you have less than 30 points of luck, however, you're dead.
2344840	2349640	Well, okay, so yeah, I do.
2349640	2356960	He spends the luck and he, are you sure you want to, yeah, I'm, I'm above 30.
2356960	2358520	I'm doing all right.
2358520	2359600	He spends that luck.
2359600	2365200	He puts it all together and, and has an epiphany moment and, and what does he discover?
2365200	2369200	One thing I'll ask before you do this, do you have any points of Cthulhu Mythos?
2369200	2370800	I have 10%.
2370880	2374240	We'll see what that applies in a moment.
2375360	2381760	The first thing that you work out is that this does tie in with your working theory as
2381760	2386880	to what that other antenna was, that electrical wiring and the antenna around here do
2386880	2395840	seem to be receiving equipment for whatever is going to get transmitted from the house.
2396240	2402800	And you reckon that when the power turns up, that it is going to light up that huge light
2402800	2403360	up above.
2404160	2405040	Sorry, what light is that?
2405680	2408880	The huge lighthouse type bulb that is above your head.
2409920	2418000	What makes less sense to you is some of the other antennae that are around here, because
2418000	2423680	looking at the design and looking at the way everything is connected, there are a few
2423680	2428960	smaller antennae that point out in other directions that you're fairly certain are
2428960	2434400	designed to transmit, but they don't look like they're designed to transmit power.
2435280	2440400	They look like maybe radio antennae, but you're not really sure.
2440400	2445680	There's something about the design that looks weird even to you.
2445680	2448880	And this is where you could give me a Cthulhu Mythos roll if you want.
2448880	2451120	Are there penalties for fumbling?
2451760	2455360	Um, well, penalties, no.
2457680	2458960	Maybe a lot of fun to be had.
2460000	2461760	Are there ways to make the story cooler?
2462480	2468480	Right now, he just has that weird tingle at the back of his mind again, and he knows something's
2468480	2468980	not right.
2470320	2474560	But I can guarantee if he fumbles, something fun will happen.
2474560	2475280	You should do it.
2475280	2477120	Yeah, you should definitely do it.
2477120	2478560	It'd be weird if you didn't.
2479200	2481600	No, I'm not going to do it.
2481600	2482800	Oh, I'm sorry.
2482800	2485200	We should have told Thomas not to do it.
2487840	2490160	Hey, Thomas, don't do it.
2490160	2490960	I'm not...
2490960	2492080	Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
2495840	2502320	Okay, so yeah, I mean, there's something weird about the design of these, but you can't quite
2502320	2503680	work out what it is.
2503680	2507280	You know, Harvey, there's something quite weird about all this, but I can't work out
2507280	2507920	what it is.
2507920	2508880	What do you mean by weird?
2508880	2512080	I mean, it's a lot of that same kind of equipment you got in your place.
2512640	2513680	Nothing's weird here.
2513680	2519040	Again, Harvey, I know the distinction may be subtle to one such as you, but I'm a man
2519040	2521520	of science, and this is weird science.
2522320	2524960	Do you need a twine on anything?
2525520	2526560	Maybe take some readings?
2527200	2528400	He's a little depressed.
2528400	2531840	This is more advanced than he thought Mordant was capable of.
2531840	2533520	He doesn't know exactly what it is.
2533520	2535200	He knows it might be cool.
2535200	2536240	It's at least big.
2538480	2544560	And he's like, oh, Harvey, this evening isn't going anything like I imagined.
2544560	2546560	I haven't even seen Cicero or his wife.
2547600	2551920	He dejectedly flips a couple switches on and off, and he's like, but what's the point?
2551920	2554480	Does anything happen with those switch flips?
2554480	2556320	No, because there's no power at the moment.
2556320	2561280	Yeah, the power looks like it's running from the house to here.
2561280	2563200	There are no power sources here.
2563200	2570640	Yeah, it looks like if you're right, and that antenna on the main building transmits
2570640	2576000	electrical energy, it looks like that powers everything that's up here on the tower.
2576000	2578560	You could probably roll Cthulhu Mythos to figure out more.
2579200	2579920	Probably could, yeah.
2580800	2581520	Might fumble, though.
2582080	2583360	It'd be cool if he did.
2583360	2584640	But what if he passed?
2586080	2587600	It's a one-shot.
2587600	2588160	You shouldn't...
2588160	2588660	Yeah.
2591600	2594720	Listen, I'm not familiar with Pulp Cthulhu.
2594720	2598560	I just know that when you mess up Mythos shit and the other versions of shit...
2599120	2600400	It makes it cooler?
2600400	2602880	No, things go very, very bad.
2603680	2605040	It makes everything cooler.
2605040	2608960	We're Pulp Cthulhu heroes this time, so even when shit goes bad,
2608960	2610560	we're still going to be able to pull it out.
2610560	2612320	He can mind attack people.
2612320	2613440	Yeah, I fucking mind it.
2613440	2616640	I just feel like he's fooled everyone else in this room here.
2618800	2620160	He was like, no, just do it.
2620160	2620960	It'll be fun.
2620960	2625920	Scott has built an awesome roller coaster, and I just want to strap in and ride it.
2626960	2628640	Then you take a Mythos roll, bitch.
2629600	2632720	One thing I'll point out, though, is that in Pulp Cthulhu,
2632720	2634880	you can spend luck to mitigate fumbles.
2634880	2635440	That's true.
2635440	2637920	The fumble is only if it's a 96 or higher, right?
2637920	2638400	Yes.
2638400	2639680	Oh, that's fucking nothing.
2639680	2640560	Yeah, just roll it.
2640560	2641060	All right.
2642720	2643280	24.
2643280	2645440	God damn it, that would have been so funny.
2645440	2646400	24, yeah.
2646400	2647840	You could spend 14 luck.
2647840	2649040	No, no, I'm good on that.
2649040	2651840	Oh, Cthulhu Mythos?
2651840	2652640	I'm okay on that.
2655120	2656400	Okay, then...
2656400	2658000	Oh, well, hmm.
2658000	2659440	Cthulhu Mythos?
2659440	2660560	You think it's that important?
2660560	2661840	It's pretty cool, yeah.
2662720	2664160	No one ever passes these.
2665280	2667200	No, dude, I cannot spend that much luck.
2667200	2668880	I can't spend that much luck right now.
2669680	2670560	I'm sorry, dude.
2670560	2673120	God damn it, I've never been more disappointed.
2674640	2675920	Can I spend my luck?
2676320	2680320	I'll spend 14 of my luck to make this a success.
2680320	2682800	Next episode, if you guys want to trudge out here
2683680	2686160	and spend your luck, do your Mythos rolls.
2686160	2686560	I will.
2686560	2688080	I'll spend 14 of my luck.
2688080	2690320	And we'll talk to the movie stars and the senators.
2690320	2692480	You know, I am willing to accept that.
2692480	2692960	Fuck yeah.
2692960	2693840	The movie stars is.
2694640	2697520	You're willing to sacrifice 14 of your luck?
2698320	2699440	Hell yeah.
2699440	2701040	It's that psychic link you guys have.
2701360	2712000	Then what you pick up from this is there is something about the design of these other
2712000	2718640	aerials that is, for a start, very different from any of the other technology that you
2718640	2720080	can see around here.
2720080	2725600	But there is something that, as bizarre as it might sound to your obviously rational
2725600	2729200	mad scientist mind, is that it seems...
2730000	2731040	Sorry, we're losing you.
2731040	2733440	And it made a really funny sound as we lost you.
2733440	2734160	Yeah, it did.
2734160	2736000	You're like, as bizarre as it might sound...
2741840	2743120	Am I practicing with you?
2744400	2744720	Yes.
2744720	2746480	Yeah, you seem good now, yeah.
2746480	2747840	Okay, I'll try that again.
2748880	2755440	As bizarre as it might sound to your otherwise rational mad scientist mind, there is something
2755440	2761280	about the design of these other aerials and the circuitry leading to them that looks,
2762000	2763360	well, alien.
2764320	2768960	You're fairly certain that the technology here, even though you may never have encountered
2768960	2777920	anything like it before, is not of this Earth, and that it is designed to broadcast some
2777920	2782560	kind of signal using means you can't quite identify.
2783520	2787520	You think that the signal that it's sending out may even be a psychic one?
2790160	2791200	Sanity check.
2792640	2792880	Yeah.
2795120	2796960	Do I need to take a sand check for that?
2796960	2798320	I don't think so, no.
2799600	2804480	You are a mad scientist, you've got weird science, so I think this is in your wheelhouse.
2804480	2805360	Awesome.
2805360	2809760	Okay, so grasping what is going on and being an intensely jealous man...
2810640	2815600	Um, Harvey, would you lend me a hand in destroying all of this?
2819040	2822800	And he wants to just smash up everything, and it's like a fit of...
2822800	2824800	It's like professional rage.
2825360	2829120	He can't believe Mordant has built a tower.
2829120	2836880	A, he has a bad feeling about what the purposes of that broadcast are, but B, he is just enraged
2836880	2843600	that Cicero Mordant has built this kick-ass alien radio tower, and he is going to smash
2843600	2844400	it like a child.
2845040	2846640	Harvey cracks his knuckles.
2846640	2847680	Say no more, boss!
2847680	2850160	And comes down with a Hulk smash on the nearest console.
2852560	2857280	Lafayette unscrews a knob from like a lever and chucks it at the big light bulb.
2857280	2858240	Oh, yes!
2859760	2864800	In which case, let's cut away from you two as you have your protracted temper tantrum,
2864800	2867600	and go back to the others in the ballroom.
2868400	2874080	Mr. Ring was going to have his second pass at trying to meet the senator, and this time
2874080	2876480	he is accompanied by his boss.
2877760	2883200	Can you give me listen rolls each, just to see whether you can pick up snatches of conversation
2884160	2885360	as you're passing through?
2885360	2886480	I got an aught too.
2886480	2889120	Oh, I also pass 35 on a 50.
2889120	2889760	Then...
2889760	2891920	I don't super pass, like, uh...
2891920	2898240	Yeah, well, I think what Mr. Ring picks up is just a couple of snatches of conversation
2899440	2906080	where you do hear that phrase being repeated that you heard a few months ago.
2906080	2907520	It's going to change the world, you know.
2908160	2915840	But what Cheggers picks up on a 0-2 is one of the groups you move past.
2915840	2920640	There are three people standing together, all talking to each other enthusiastically,
2921440	2925360	and they're all just looking at each other over and over again, saying,
2925360	2926880	it's going to change the world, you know.
2926880	2928160	It's going to change the world, you know.
2928160	2929520	It's going to change the world, you know.
2929520	2930880	It's going to change the world, you know.
2930880	2932800	It's going to change the world, you know.
2932800	2934480	That's so good.
2934480	2936080	That's so fucking cool.
2937200	2938240	Can you give me a sand roll?
2939280	2942000	I love this game so much.
2942000	2943840	Is my sanity equal to my power?
2943840	2944320	Is that right?
2944320	2945120	Yeah.
2945120	2945840	Initially, yes.
2945840	2947680	I pass then, 75 on a 90.
2948000	2952720	So yeah, you don't lose any sand for that, but it may still send a shiver up your spine.
2952720	2954480	Yeah, it creeps me out for sure.
2954480	2960560	And then I make a mental note of like, maybe Elden can get into their heads later.
2960560	2963040	Like, they seem pretty easy.
2963040	2963680	Pretty easy.
2964480	2966320	Because that's worked out so well for himself.
2966320	2966820	Yeah.
2968560	2971040	Sweat drops down from his forehead.
2971040	2976640	But honestly, the invention is pretty low on my concern level.
2976640	2977140	Same.
2977680	2980800	Senator is top priority for me.
2980800	2983040	So we're continuing on to Billings.
2983600	2986640	Senator is a way bigger deal than actor.
2986640	2990000	So we're going to really give our go here.
2990000	2997840	OK, so yeah, you walk over and the senator is talking to a younger woman, maybe in her
2997840	2998560	30s.
2999600	3003200	She's very expensively dressed, wearing a nice diamond necklace.
3003920	3009360	She's perhaps not the most attractive woman you've ever met.
3013520	3020560	She's got one eye that seems to swivel around a bit and a nose that's a bit too large for
3020560	3020960	her face.
3020960	3023680	But she's got an absolutely radiant smile.
3023680	3025600	Just roasting this poor woman.
3025600	3028080	Yeah, you were really rude until the last thing.
3029280	3031360	He based it on your mom.
3034160	3035600	That's why it takes so much offense.
3038000	3041360	You could give me education rolls, the two of you, just to see whether you recognize
3041360	3041600	her.
3041600	3042960	I think I do recognize her.
3042960	3043360	I do, too.
3043360	3044800	With the 24, 54.
3044800	3048080	OK, yeah, again, you've seen her in the society pages.
3048080	3052160	This is Margaret Payne, who's the heiress of the Payne fortune.
3052160	3061200	She is primarily a philanthropist that she's involved in a lot of humanitarian and art
3061200	3061840	charities.
3062800	3067840	And she and Senator Billings seem to be talking quite animatedly as you come over.
3067840	3072000	So, yeah, as we approach them, Eldon, you take the senator.
3072000	3073200	Yeah, of course, Checkers.
3073200	3075200	Yeah, definitely.
3075200	3076400	What was her name again?
3076400	3077120	Margaret Payne.
3077920	3078560	He whispers.
3078560	3082720	He's like the bag man for Checkers.
3082720	3088720	He's like, it's Margaret Payne is the philanthropist and Charlton Billings is the senator from
3088720	3089280	Vermont.
3089280	3089780	Thank you.
3090580	3093620	Miss, Miss Payne.
3093620	3098260	And she looks around and says, oh, do we know each other?
3098260	3099380	We're about to.
3099380	3101540	And I turn the charm on.
3105540	3107380	I should give you a penalty on the charm.
3108500	3110580	Well, I roll an ought to again.
3110580	3115380	Oh, my God.
3115380	3123060	Then somehow, despite that opening, she seems to warm to you and say, oh, did we meet at
3123620	3125940	that party in the Hamptons last summer?
3125940	3127300	You do look very familiar.
3127300	3132100	I don't believe we've met in real life, but you have seen me in your dreams.
3135300	3140500	And she tilts her head back and laughs quite musically and says, oh, you are funny.
3141460	3142260	Yes, funny.
3145300	3149460	I actually have a charity that you might be interested in.
3149460	3152420	I know that you're a big, big into philanthropy.
3152420	3154980	And yeah, the last branch.
3154980	3157140	Have you ever heard of us?
3157140	3162100	The last branch, I'll tell you what, give me a LUCK roll.
3164420	3165860	24 on a 32.
3165860	3171540	Yes, I'm trying to work out whether it would be luckier or unluckier.
3173060	3176180	I think it's probably I think it's probably better for you if she hasn't heard of you.
3176180	3176660	Right.
3176660	3177380	Yep.
3177380	3180580	And she says, no, but you must tell me more.
3180580	3184100	Oh, well, we've got, you know, Miss Jermaine?
3184100	3188180	Oh, the actress, I saw her earlier.
3188180	3189300	Yeah, she's a big...
3189300	3191620	Between you and me, I'm a little bit worried about her.
3191620	3195860	I saw her come back from the lavatory earlier and there was white powder on her nose.
3195860	3196260	Oh, yeah.
3196260	3197780	Ask this lady if she has any cocaine.
3199220	3202180	The one who's worried about them then doesn't know what to wipe out.
3202180	3202500	Yeah.
3202500	3202740	Yeah.
3202740	3209220	Well, I actually spoke to her when we arrived at the party and I got rid of that for her.
3209220	3210260	I was worried as well.
3215220	3218580	Oh, you must be such a good friend to her.
3218580	3222100	She is a very important part of our organization.
3222100	3226420	The mind is the most important part of the human soul body space.
3226420	3226660	Yeah.
3226660	3232500	So our organization serves to help free people's minds in a sense.
3232500	3236580	Oh, do you find a lot of people whose minds are enchained?
3236580	3237540	Everybody's is.
3238260	3239620	Yours included.
3239620	3240500	Really?
3240500	3240900	Really?
3241940	3242260	Yes.
3242260	3242500	Yes.
3242500	3243620	You must tell me more about this.
3244180	3248980	Before we get into all that, have you seen our host anywhere?
3248980	3250900	I'm a little bit worried about him.
3250900	3251780	I have not.
3251780	3253300	Have you seen him this evening?
3253300	3254020	Not at all.
3254020	3255220	And I'm a bit worried.
3255220	3256740	Cicero and I go way back.
3258100	3260180	We were engaged, we married once.
3260180	3264900	But tell us more about the heartbreak that must have come from that.
3267220	3270580	Well, relationships fail for a variety of different reasons.
3270580	3275620	But I'm more concerned about how he's been in recent months.
3275620	3279540	I mean, have you seen him at all over the last year?
3280580	3282580	He's a changed man, isn't he?
3282580	3284260	I'm really quite worried about him.
3284260	3292180	I mean, we were talking about your young lady friend a little while back and perhaps indulgences.
3292180	3293860	But I'm...
3294740	3296900	Do you think he's indulging?
3296900	3300420	Is she paying to get her sins removed so that she may go to heaven?
3300580	3304340	Eldon, quiet for a second.
3307060	3310420	Nobody had Luke tell Zach to calm down Bingo.
3318260	3322500	She looks at Mr. Ring quizzically for a moment and then continues,
3323460	3325860	Well, I'm just a bit concerned, yes, that...
3327300	3333300	I don't know, maybe it's nothing but some of the changes I've seen in his personality
3333300	3338180	and the changes in his health, I'm a little bit worried about him.
3338180	3342180	Particularly the fact that he hasn't made an entrance when this is his big night.
3342180	3344980	And you know Cicero, don't you?
3344980	3351540	I mean, you know how much he loves working a crowd and making new friends.
3352180	3357060	Quick question, when you think about his new invention, what comes to mind?
3358020	3359140	It's going to change the world.
3363140	3365860	I look at Eldon and I'm like, do the thing.
3365860	3370340	He looks back and he looks scared and he like shakes his head no
3370340	3376340	and like kind of like moves back away from you like a dog that did something wrong.
3376340	3379860	I pull the smelling salt vial thing out of my pocket, I'm like,
3380500	3381000	it's okay.
3382660	3389060	The pained look on Eldon Ring's face as he tries to decide whether or not he can...
3389060	3390260	Margaret Payne look.
3391860	3396340	As he's trying to decide, you know, whether or not he needs to follow his master's...
3396340	3401620	Psychic attack, psychic attack, psychic attack!
3401620	3403300	Okay, well give me that roll.
3404420	3408420	I legitimately feel like stunned and psychic attacked every time you do that.
3408500	3411220	I got really excited because I rolled a 44.
3411220	3412740	That is a hard success though.
3412740	3413140	Nice.
3413140	3414340	I thought it was a crit.
3414340	3416100	Oh, but we're not playing.
3416100	3419940	I am going to roll against you from your psychic opponent.
3419940	3420440	Of course.
3421780	3422660	Hard felt good.
3423540	3424420	Hard felt good.
3424420	3425060	That's what she said.
3426260	3426820	Wow.
3426820	3429220	Yeah, that's an extreme.
3429220	3430420	Oh, fucking shit!
3433780	3438020	This time the darkness closes around your mind once more.
3438980	3442820	And you hear this, this voice again in the darkness.
3443940	3447540	Oh, you are a tenacious little thing, aren't you?
3448580	3452020	I think, I think we should play together.
3453300	3454420	Would you enjoy that?
3455460	3455940	Yes, sir.
3456580	3458340	Good, good.
3459060	3463700	I think while you're here, why don't you help me?
3464260	3464760	Okay.
3465640	3466920	You'd like that, wouldn't you?
3466920	3468520	You'd like to help me.
3469560	3472360	Yeah, everybody likes to be useful.
3472360	3474040	Yes, I thought you would.
3475720	3482840	Well, it is very, very important that everything goes well as possible tonight.
3482840	3486040	There's no interference, no silly games.
3486040	3488120	I think it's important there's no silly games.
3488120	3490440	And more importantly, that everyone is impressed
3491080	3497000	by Cicero's invention because it's going to change the world, you know.
3497000	3498760	It's going to change the world, you know.
3498760	3503240	And you do understand how important it is to get that message out there.
3503800	3507960	I can feel your little gifts there.
3508920	3514120	Why don't you use them in service of me and of Cicero
3514120	3518440	and of the glory that his invention will bring to the world?
3518440	3519480	What's your name, sir?
3519480	3521240	I have many names.
3522120	3524840	I have so many names.
3526040	3526600	That's cool.
3526600	3527720	I gave myself mine.
3529240	3530600	Well, isn't that special?
3537240	3542040	The evil voice in your head really condescended to you there.
3542680	3543240	No, no, no.
3543240	3544680	I felt no condescension.
3544680	3547160	Elden Ring is like, oh, yes, to be held.
3547160	3552120	Checkers is standing there looking at you with your eyes rolled back in your head.
3552120	3554120	And he's like, he's nailing it.
3558120	3560280	That's my boy in psychic warfare.
3560840	3565240	Well, if I can count on you to help me with this small matter,
3565240	3568440	then I'm sure we'll be great friends.
3568440	3572280	Otherwise, I may have to punish you.
3572280	3574600	You do understand, don't you?
3574600	3576360	Yeah, I sure wouldn't like that.
3576440	3577560	Good, good, good.
3577560	3578680	I'm so happy.
3579800	3582520	And if you're happy with me framing it this way,
3583400	3590360	perhaps then Mr. Ring wakes up once again there on the ground with checkers.
3590360	3592440	You're doing the spending salt trick again
3592440	3597160	and Miss Payne and the senators standing there looking worried.
3597160	3601000	And standing in between them is the Reverend Nye,
3601560	3604840	and he just smiles down at you and winks
3605640	3607320	and just for a moment as he winks,
3607320	3609320	you can see that his eyes are completely black.
3610520	3615320	Fuck yeah!
3615320	3617640	Oh, hell yes.
3617640	3618600	Yes, yes, yes.
3634840	3638920	I didn't know that the wind could sew
3640920	3644920	through tissue and faggot bone.
3648120	3652920	You were hollow when you spoke to me.
3655880	3659400	Hollow when you said
3659400	3667560	I thought you might be starving
3667560	3677560	so I gave you everything.
3677560	3683720	Thorns and rocks and devils' clothes
3683720	3688360	and briars and private clay
3689080	3693640	and crocus blossoms in February
3693640	3697640	and I live in May.
3698840	3703400	Time between a mother's fingers
3703400	3706520	and spit off of a bridge.
3708680	3716520	Restless legs at 3pm while waiting for a fix.
3748360	3763320	So come back here and see what's left of me.
3767960	3773480	Is this the wholesome girl you left in Missouri?
3773480	3785000	My voice is nothing now but the howl of the wind.
3787000	3790520	Come closer dear, in my teeth,
3790520	3793000	thread her in my jaw.
3796680	3801720	Come closer dear, in my teeth.
3803480	3809800	Thread her in my jaw.
