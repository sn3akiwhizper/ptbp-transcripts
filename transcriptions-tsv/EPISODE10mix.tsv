0	4800	Welcome y'all to the most rip-roaring radio show in contention.
4800	9020	It's your friendly neighborhood DJ, Wolf the dog.
9020	14800	We are broadcasting live and uncut from 694.2 PTBP.
14800	19760	Welcome to one of only two segments on this show, Howlin' with Wolf.
19760	25040	This listener wrote, hey Wolf, just wanna give a shout out to all my amazing DM Joe
25040	31320	and my swashbuckling comrades Opus, Dick Buggsley and Wingapo.
31320	36480	We have survived pirates, shark people and hurricanes raining blood and I wouldn't have
36480	38920	wanted to go through it with anyone else.
38920	43360	Thanks for a great adventure, love Blythe.
43360	49240	You know, that was real sweet, except for that part about shark people and bloody precipitation.
49240	53240	That sounds nasty, Wolf the dog kinda nasty.
53240	58360	Your old buddy Wolf wants to hear all about your nasty, go ahead and submit a 5 star review
58360	64100	on your podcast app, screenshot that shit and send it to us or tag us on social media
64100	69960	at pretendingpod on instagram and twitter, pretending to be people of facebook.
69960	75560	Now speaking of blood filled hurricanes, I'm about to make it rain some news on y'all.
75560	80800	Officers Bishop and Pettymore headed to the suburbs to chat with Dr. Marie Jacobs when
80800	85040	they saw an unkempt man frantically vacuuming his lawn.
85040	90560	There are two more paragraphs here but they have been crossed out with a very, very thick
90560	91560	sharpie.
91560	97720	Our brave and heroic contingent police officer Keith Vigna was made unconscious by Billy
97720	104240	Harrison, the man found tied up in the trunk of Charles Donovan, the drunk who threatened
104240	106000	the woman at Forgotten Treasures.
106000	111840	Both of these cats have told officers that they are friends of John Peters.
111840	117160	Now speaking of cats, Dr. Marie Jacobs seems to be up to no good y'all.
117160	122240	Officers Bishop and Pettymore found man sized fecal matter in the litter box and then doctor
122240	128440	yelled Salem, prompting something to begin running up the stairs from the basement.
128440	130720	Y'all ever take a shit in your cat's litter box?
158440	179440	Keith, you wake up wearing a thin gown and both of your wrists have been handcuffed to
179440	181880	the sides of the hospital bed that you are in.
181880	187120	Billy Harrison, your uniform and your gear are nowhere to be seen.
187120	192520	However, the door to this room is now open and a decent amount of the clinic staff is
192520	194720	standing around outside it.
194720	196960	Some of them are pointing their phones at you.
196960	199280	All of them are laughing.
199280	205520	Some more subtly than others, you overhear a few phrases like, no wonder William was
205520	210240	so embarrassed by him and oh, isn't that, isn't that Keith Beans?
210240	212300	What's he calling himself now?
212300	216920	And they notice you wake up and awkwardly shuffle about as a young woman comes into
216920	222360	the room with bolt cutters and breaks the links on your cuffs, leaving you with a pair
222360	224760	of nice iron bracelets.
224760	228240	And she says, ignore them, a bunch of gossip hounds.
228240	229520	Are you okay?
229520	230960	What the hell happened?
230960	232720	We're not entirely sure.
232720	236960	It seems that you may have been unconscious for, for some time.
236960	239360	Have you found, where's Billy Harrison at?
239360	244480	The man that you came in with is no longer here.
244520	246520	No one has seen him.
246520	250040	Well, I gotta, I gotta get going.
250040	251040	Okay.
251040	257440	I want to see if I can see security footage to see where he went off to or how he got away.
257440	262640	You can go check and she'll take you to go look at the security footage in the clinic
262640	266400	and they really just have like a couple cameras in the lobby.
266400	267400	Oh yeah.
267400	269600	We were at the clinic and not the hospital, right?
269600	270600	Correct.
270600	271600	You're at the clinic in contention.
271600	277800	The footage shows Billy Harrison in your uniform, just walking out the front door.
277800	278800	Okay.
278800	284160	Well, the guys are not going to be happy about this one.
284160	290360	As you, as you, as you, uh, as you get to the front door, it is rather dark outside.
290360	291400	What time did we get here?
291400	292620	Early evening.
292620	295640	So it's been like a couple hours or an hour or?
295640	300360	I would say, yeah, I mean you came in and you waited around for a while for his results
300360	303160	and for him to come to.
303160	304600	And he had had a concussion.
304600	305600	Is that right?
305600	306600	Yes.
306600	307600	Hmm.
307600	308600	I rode here in the ambulance, didn't I?
308600	309600	Correct.
309600	312040	So I'm going to have to radio the guys to come get me.
312040	313040	I think.
313040	314040	Okay.
314040	315040	Yeah.
315040	318040	That sounds good.
318040	321880	Okay.
321880	328440	John had just finished getting handcuffs on Dr. Marie Jacobs when she hollered, and you
328440	333040	heard something glumping up the stairs from the basement.
333040	334120	What do you do?
334120	338400	If I just hear footsteps going up the stairs, I'm just looking down the stairs.
338400	343800	Clark, you've got your hand keeping the basement door open and you lean your head back to look
343800	351600	down the stairs and you see a man with blood pouring down his face onto his chest from
351600	354080	a seemingly broken nose.
354080	362400	He is wearing a pair of novelty boxer briefs featuring Pepe Le Pew and a black collar around
362400	363400	his neck.
363400	371800	And he is on all fours making his way up the stairs at a rapid pace.
371800	374800	John.
374800	378560	I guess I draw my gun.
378560	379920	And yell, stop right there.
379920	380920	Same.
380920	382320	I mean, as soon as I would see it.
382320	383320	Okay.
383560	388680	So, Clark, he is going to jump at you.
388680	392240	He is like raising up onto his hind legs.
392240	393620	Any visible claws?
393620	396360	No claws, just hands.
396360	400120	And he is, it looks like he's pouncing on you.
400120	402080	I want to get away from that.
402080	406680	So are you going to try to get away or how are you handling the situation?
406680	408760	I would like to dodge out of the way.
408760	409760	All right.
409760	410760	Sounds good.
411040	414000	Against his unarmed combat.
414000	415520	Passed 24 on a 50.
415520	416520	Okay.
416520	418480	He passed 40 on a something.
418480	427200	So he is going to, he actually, he rolled pounce.
427200	433120	And so John, you actually see right next to you, this man takes Clark to the ground with
433120	435400	his hands on Clark's shoulders.
435400	436400	Huh?
436400	438400	What the fuck?
438920	442640	And it is John's action.
442640	443640	Jesus.
443640	445520	What do you do?
445520	447880	I, uh, what is Marie doing?
447880	448880	She's just handcuffed.
448880	449880	Correct.
449880	453640	She is not doing anything right now because it's your turn.
453640	454640	Okay.
454640	457400	I just yell, get off him.
457400	458880	Come on, come on Salem.
458880	459880	Get off.
459880	460880	Fuck man.
460880	461880	I don't know what to do in a cat man situation.
461880	464120	Uh, I want to try to like kick him off.
464120	465120	Okay.
465120	467120	Get out of here.
467160	468160	Get out of here.
468160	469160	Get.
469160	470160	Get.
470160	474360	Roll unarmed combat to kick him off.
474360	477440	Can I roll strength?
477440	480440	If you, if you're trying to kick him, if you want to roll strength, that would be like
480440	484520	trying to grab and like, I'm trying to push him with my leg muscles.
484520	485520	Okay.
485520	489040	I mean, an arm's fine.
489040	490040	Neither one is great.
490040	491040	Ooh.
491040	492440	Pass 32 on a 40.
492440	493440	Nice.
493440	494440	Yeah.
494440	495440	He's distracted right now.
495560	498480	And so you put your foot where on his body?
498480	502640	Like wherever I think I'm going to get the most leverage, like center mass, like right
502640	508480	above his hip, you just like chest area, just trying to like, but I feel like I'm coming
508480	509480	at him from the side.
509480	510480	Right?
510480	511480	Yeah.
511480	512480	It's just a solid like rib like.
512480	513480	Yeah.
513480	514480	Right in the ribs.
514480	517080	And you, uh, you, you, you hoist him off of Clark.
517080	520280	Does he not seem to recognize that he has like a gun pointed at him?
520280	521280	Like no.
521280	522280	Okay.
522280	524760	So he's pretty full cat man.
524760	529040	And immediately Maria Marie says, don't, don't hurt him.
529040	530040	Don't hurt him.
530040	531040	Clark.
531040	532040	It is your turn.
532040	534680	Uh, we saw pictures earlier of her and her husband and the cat.
534680	535680	That is correct.
535680	536880	Does this guy look like the husband?
536880	537880	This is Doug Jacobs.
537880	538880	Okay.
538880	541800	So say Salem, Doug is laying on the ground now.
541800	542800	Yes.
542800	549320	He has a, he has fallen over on his side and he just lays there and puts his hand on your
549320	550320	face
550320	553920	rub his belly.
553920	555720	I want to try and cuff him.
555720	556720	Okay.
556720	557720	Roll law or dexterity.
557720	560000	They happen to be the same.
560000	561000	Oh fun.
561000	563040	38 on a 60.
563040	564040	Okay.
564040	569320	You reach out and throw a cuff on the hand that has reached out for your face and you
569320	572400	can pretty easily get his other hand cuffed as well.
572400	573400	Nice.
573400	574400	Behind or in front?
574400	575400	I would like behind.
575400	576400	Okay.
576400	579680	So you just kind of do a maneuver and roll over on him and handcuff him.
579680	584480	So now you are on top of him and he is face down on the ground and he's just kind of laying
584480	585480	there.
585480	586480	He's not worried about it.
586480	587480	He seems domesticated.
587480	588480	Clark.
588480	592000	Dr. Jacobs, do you want to tell us what the hell is going on here?
592000	594560	Why is your husband a cat man named Salem?
594560	599080	Oh, so you know that's what's going on here.
599080	601560	Do you want to describe the process?
601560	604800	Go ahead and roll sanity for me real quick.
604800	605800	Both of you.
605800	606800	Oh, 95.
606800	607800	92.
607800	608800	92.
608800	609800	92.
609800	611800	All right.
611800	612800	You both lose one.
612800	613800	I'm at 42 now.
613800	614800	I'm at 43.
614800	618640	I want to roll Doug over on so that he's looking at me.
618640	621920	Hey, Salem, Doug, can you hear me?
621920	622920	In English?
622920	624880	He doesn't speak English.
624880	625880	He's a cat.
625880	628560	How long has he been a cat?
628560	630560	Couple days.
630560	632360	Okay.
632360	634000	How did he become a cat?
634000	635440	Why am I?
635440	638020	Ma'am, this is all kinds of illegal.
638020	641380	I don't think there's anything on the books.
641380	644620	You can't have cat golems.
644620	645620	It's not a golem.
645620	646620	It's...
646620	648860	Listen, lady, whatever the hell this is, you can't have, okay?
648860	649860	I didn't ask for this.
649860	652980	This belongs in a science lab or something.
652980	658860	You can't just take away my cat because he happens to be taking the place inside the
658860	661060	body of my husband.
661060	662300	Oh.
662300	665040	It's a regular old Salem in the body thing.
665040	666040	It's a freaky Friday?
666040	667040	It's a freaky Friday.
667080	669100	Did your husband get freaky Frid- Doctor, I'm sorry.
669100	670560	Did your husband get freaky Friday-ed?
670560	671560	Which one?
671560	673080	The Jimmy Lee Curtis.
673080	674080	Oh.
674080	678080	Yes.
678080	682280	How did your husband get freaky Friday-ed?
682280	686640	I'm not positive, but it happened when I got the radio.
686640	687680	Interesting.
687680	690640	You didn't think this was something you needed to tell anybody?
690640	695760	I have personal reasons for being fine with the current situation.
695760	709840	You know what, man?
709840	711080	I think we needed that.
711080	713520	I think we can all understand that a little bit.
713520	715760	Is your husband in Salem?
715760	718080	Where's the cat boy?
718080	723080	Doug ran out of here almost immediately.
723080	730640	It's not that he was a- Doug was not a very good man or a good husband.
730640	732560	I was fine to be rid of him.
732560	738360	If he wants to wander the streets as a kitty cat, that is totally fine by me.
738360	741760	I don't think this concerns the police, honestly.
741760	746920	You know, I can't tell you exactly how, but I am certain 100% this concerns the police.
746920	748520	I just don't see it.
748520	751960	There's a lot that feels illegal here, but you're right, I can't exactly put my finger
751960	752960	on it.
753280	754280	If only Maggie were here.
754280	758080	I haven't been able to find any statute on the books.
758080	762040	So you've been looking into, you had a suspicion, maybe this wasn't right.
762040	763880	You've been checking your P's and Q's here?
763880	767240	I quit Google search.
767240	772280	Hey doctor, why is Doug man cat, cat man Doug, nose bleedin'?
772280	776280	Oh, that tall awful man punched him in the face.
776280	778040	I thought it was very rude.
778040	779280	When he stole your radio?
779280	780280	Yes!
780280	785360	He was very aggressive, and Salem tried to protect me, thankfully he didn't shoot him.
785360	788600	He follows instruction really well, you know, we could maybe use something like this on
788600	789600	the force.
789600	794880	This is my cat, and I'm not going to give him to the contention police department just
794880	798480	because he's a giant man now.
798480	804160	I mean he's a regular, he's a tall man, he's not, you know, giant per se, but...
804160	809260	It's gonna take scientists and philosophers decades to figure out what this is.
809260	810380	This is not your cat.
810380	817340	I would personally appreciate it if we didn't go to scientists or authorities above yourselves.
817340	821060	On this matter, if you could just leave me be, I don't see an issue here.
821060	823140	Clark, you want to talk a minute?
823140	824380	Me and you, yeah.
824380	829020	We've garnered the information that the radio is not here anymore, that maybe our drunk
829020	830540	Charlie guy took it.
830540	835160	Right, and the lead we have on him is falling up on his hotel room, where maybe all this
835160	836820	stuff might be waiting for us.
836820	843460	John would be open to, like, John would just be like, oh, if you want this not talked about,
843460	844460	what's in it for me?
844460	846260	I don't, Clark wouldn't though, right?
846260	847260	Probably?
847260	848260	No.
848260	849260	Yeah.
849260	852180	But Clark is also a little insane and doesn't know, like, we real quick were happy with
852180	856280	the Freaky Friday explanation, which I'm cool with, but so I don't know where to take him
856280	858780	from here.
858780	862500	He can still, I mean, he can, he could have not processed anything yet.
862500	866460	He might just in the moment like, uh-huh, yeah, okay.
867460	869180	Yeah, but this still leaves us, where do we go?
869180	870180	Where do we go?
870180	871180	Yeah.
871180	872180	We've got to secure this cat man somehow.
872180	873180	Thanks.
873180	874180	God damn it.
874180	876620	Do we take a cat man in?
876620	881180	I think we should take them both in because it would be hilarious to have them in a jail cell.
881180	882180	Yeah, let's do that.
882180	888160	Ma'am, um, I'm really sorry to tell you this, but we're going to have to take you and Doug
888160	890160	Salem in for further questioning.
890160	891160	Just Salem?
891160	895660	Well, again, the theological, the biological.
895860	896860	Salem?
896860	897860	In Doug's body.
897860	898860	In Doug's body, yeah.
898860	899860	Eh.
899860	903540	This is your cat in spirit and his mind has inhabited your husband's body.
903540	905660	Our vessels matter very little to me.
905660	908660	Well, I don't know if they do to the law is the thing.
908660	912320	In fact, most of our laws are about the harming of those vessels.
912320	913460	This seems like harm.
913460	915100	Yeah, he's a victim.
915100	920980	Go catch, uh, go catch that drunk man.
920980	921980	Yeah.
922300	926360	Do we, I don't know if we need to take them like taking them in would be handy for us
926360	930980	if we need to ask him or anything, anything more, but also just, I think it would be hilarious.
930980	931980	Yeah.
931980	936020	Doctor, uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to take you down to the station for 24 hours,
936020	939880	48 maybe, uh, ask you a few more questions and what are you going to do?
939880	941140	Put this on the books.
941140	942500	Who's going to believe you?
942500	944220	You're all going to be fired immediately.
944220	949660	Actually, ma'am, uh, there is a bit of an, uh, managerial crisis at the police station
949660	950660	right now.
950820	955060	We don't have a whole lot of supervision at the moment, so I think for 48 hours we can,
955060	956420	uh, get some more out of you.
956420	958680	Well, I think that's genuinely horrifying.
958680	961600	I think your cat husband is genuinely horrifying.
961600	963380	I think he's rather cute.
963380	964380	He's also that.
964380	967860	Uh, does Salem have any, uh, toys he particularly likes?
967860	969100	Clark, he's a perp.
969100	971140	I just figured we'd have to get him in the car somehow.
971140	976500	This is a man who literally just tackled a police officer.
976500	981740	She kind of steps over to the side and reaches behind her back onto the couch.
981740	982740	Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
982740	983740	Oh, sorry, sorry.
983740	985340	This is his favorite toy.
985340	989660	Well, why don't you, uh, stand on up and direct us to the toy?
989660	990660	Okay.
990660	991660	It's right here.
991660	997660	And she kind of points with her chin down at a, uh, it's just a long string cat tail
997660	1000860	kind of thing that Salem immediately perks up at.
1000860	1002980	I go and grab it.
1002980	1007420	He's on the ground and he's handcuffed behind his back, but he is shuffling kind of over
1007420	1012600	to you and nipping with his mouth at the end of the cat toy.
1012600	1013600	That's real unsettling.
1013600	1018420	And there's blood everywhere, all over his chest and it's dried and it's all over his
1018420	1019420	mouth.
1019420	1024020	You know, at the very least, he needs some medical attention, which he's not getting
1024020	1025020	them.
1025020	1026020	Yeah.
1026020	1030140	I start using the cat toy to lead him into the back of my car.
1031140	1036540	Here Salem, uh, get the, get the mousy.
1036540	1037540	Come on.
1037540	1038540	Follow me.
1038540	1039540	Meow.
1039540	1040540	Meow.
1040540	1041540	Meow.
1041540	1046140	I lead them all the way outside to the back of my car and throw the toy in.
1046140	1049860	Dr. Marie Jacobs will reluctantly follow.
1049860	1055980	She's laughing to herself the entire time she walks to the cruiser.
1055980	1057140	As well as she should.
1057140	1063720	And once you guys get out to the cruiser, you get a call from Keith Vigna on your cell
1063720	1073100	phone.
1073100	1074100	Welcome back everybody.
1074100	1075100	Do we start?
1075100	1076100	He didn't say one.
1076100	1077100	Oh shit.
1077100	1078100	Yeah.
1078100	1079100	Start over.
1079100	1080100	Okay.
1080100	1081100	Sorry.
1081100	1082100	Three, two.
1082100	1083100	Welcome back everybody.
1083100	1084100	Did he?
1084100	1085100	He didn't say it.
1085100	1086100	We got to start over.
1086100	1087100	I don't think we're supposed to start.
1088060	1089060	Four, three.
1089060	1090060	Yeah.
1090060	1092260	I'm just not hearing it in the phone.
1092260	1093260	I'm not getting it.
1093260	1094260	No, I'm not getting that one.
1094260	1095260	There's a short in my.
1095260	1096260	Not getting that go.
1096260	1097260	I don't think.
1097260	1098260	That go word.
1098260	1103920	So Clark, you receive a call on your cell phone from a number that comes up as the contention
1103920	1104920	clinic.
1104920	1105920	Officer Bishop.
1105920	1106920	Hey, it's Keith.
1106920	1107920	Hey Keith.
1107920	1111220	I need a ride because remember I rode here in the ambulance.
1111220	1112220	Oh, that's right.
1112220	1115700	Our imitating life.
1115700	1118740	I got a couple of perps in my car.
1118740	1120060	I'll send John your way.
1120060	1121060	Who's the perps.
1121060	1122060	Uh, congratulations.
1122060	1124380	It's a, it's, it's a real long story.
1124380	1125380	You'll uh, cool.
1125380	1132420	Well, I'm glad that you got some perps cause I'm not a big deal, but, uh, well I'll just
1132420	1136060	let John see me when he gets here, send him over my way.
1136060	1137060	Yeah.
1137060	1138060	That's what I'll do.
1138060	1139060	Okay.
1139060	1140060	Have a great one.
1140060	1141060	Bye.
1141060	1142060	I click.
1142060	1143140	Uh, Hey John.
1143140	1144660	It sounds like Keith fucked up again.
1144660	1145660	Yeah.
1145820	1149380	He's just becoming less and less effective as he loses motility.
1149380	1150800	He needs a ride though from the clinic.
1150800	1154060	I'm going to take these guys back to the station and uh, I'll meet you guys there.
1154060	1155060	Right on.
1163740	1166660	John, you pull up to the clinic.
1166660	1169200	The sun is very down by now.
1169200	1170760	It is a late evening.
1170760	1172740	I don't remember if I could walk or not.
1172740	1173880	Yes, I can.
1173880	1174880	You can walk now.
1174880	1175880	Okay, cool.
1175880	1176880	You can walk.
1176880	1177880	You're just a little hobbled.
1177880	1178880	Gotcha.
1178880	1181680	Luke, do you want to describe what John sees when he pulls up?
1181680	1188440	Um, I'm standing outside in just a hospital gown with some nice new bracelets on, uh,
1188440	1190480	they're handcuffs and I had to cut the chain.
1190480	1194880	So the chains are just kind of flopping down on either side and uh, I have no shoes or
1194880	1203480	anything else on and I'm waving John down to come get me.
1203480	1206380	John sees that pulling up and it's just like, what the fuck?
1206380	1212920	I popped the passenger door open and go, well, you wouldn't believe what happened.
1212920	1218720	Yeah, we uh, we, we had something a little strange happen to us as well.
1218720	1221480	Well, I heard that you got a couple guys.
1221480	1223640	That means we're up.
1223640	1225640	One woman and one undetermined.
1225640	1228920	Oh, interesting.
1228920	1233240	Let's go back to the police department so I can get my change of clothes.
1233240	1237320	It's a little breezy in this gown.
1237320	1241560	Also yeah, he attacked me and handcuffed me to the bed and he got away, stole all my stuff.
1241560	1242560	Who attacked you?
1242560	1245440	The guy that we took to the, to the clinic.
1245440	1246440	Billy Harrison.
1246440	1247440	Oh, the soldier?
1247440	1248440	Yeah.
1248440	1249440	Okay.
1249440	1254300	So I had a conversation with him about John Peters.
1254300	1258240	Something was up there and then he, I was kind of catching onto something and so he,
1258680	1264560	I don't really, it was kind of a blur, but next thing I know, you know, people are taking
1264560	1270840	pictures of me and laughing at me, you know, cause I was chained to the bed.
1270840	1273140	Did he cuff you with your own handcuffs?
1273140	1274140	He did.
1274140	1275140	Vigna.
1275140	1277320	He stole my gun too.
1277320	1279040	Oh my God, Vigna.
1279040	1282880	And he's probably wearing, I, I know that he's wearing my uniform right now.
1282880	1284880	God damn it.
1284880	1285880	Vigna.
1285880	1286880	Vigna.
1286880	1287880	Shoot.
1287880	1288880	I did the best.
1288880	1290320	I didn't do the best I could do.
1290320	1291840	I can do better next time.
1291840	1292840	Clearly.
1292840	1293840	Can you?
1293840	1294840	I promise.
1294840	1300080	Let's just get back to the police department so I can get into a change of clothes.
1300080	1303540	All thoughts of a cat man are out of John's mind.
1303540	1304540	Cat man?
1304540	1306760	He just thought it and in fact didn't thought it.
1306760	1307760	So.
1307760	1308760	Okay.
1308760	1309760	You haven't heard that yet.
1309760	1314040	Well, don't, don't tell Clark about, well, I guess I'm going to have to tell Clark about
1314040	1315040	this.
1315200	1318160	Oh, I'm going to tell Clark about this.
1318160	1324040	We followed up on Dr. Marie Jacobs and that radio Freaky Friday'd her husband and her
1324040	1325040	cat.
1325040	1326040	According to her.
1326040	1329680	Her husband is in her cat's body and her cat is in her husband's body?
1329680	1332440	You are grasping it right away.
1332440	1333440	Cool.
1333440	1337700	So as soon as we get you all- Wait, so do you arrest them?
1337700	1341980	We arrested the husband's body and the cat and Dr. Marie Jacobs.
1341980	1345260	The cat with the husband's mind is MIA.
1345260	1348660	It ran away or- It ran off apparently the second the switch
1348660	1349660	happened.
1349660	1350660	Okay.
1350660	1352580	Well, that'll be- Can he talk or does he meow?
1352580	1353580	He meows.
1353580	1354980	He's a friendly little bugger though.
1354980	1356420	This'll be a sight to see.
1356420	1360180	I don't really believe you, but- Yeah, I don't know why I'd lie about something like that.
1360180	1366180	Alright, so you guys make it to the police station and when you arrive, what are you
1366180	1367180	up to?
1367180	1374180	As soon as I got there, I stepped inside and I said to Drew, Hey, uh, Drew, I need you
1374180	1380540	to get together some blankies and, uh, make, it's like a cat bed, but for like a human
1380540	1382980	size cat in one of the cells for me.
1382980	1383980	Okay.
1383980	1384980	Thank you, Drew.
1384980	1385980	Yeah, of course.
1385980	1389440	Then I go back out to the cruiser, I open the door and I say, doctor, would you, would
1389440	1392140	you mind helping me make sure Salem gets in here real safe?
1392140	1393140	Yeah, of course.
1393140	1396440	So I'm using the toy, but I'm also hoping that she is taking up the rear.
1396440	1397440	She is.
1397440	1398440	Yeah.
1398440	1399440	No, they're gonna, yeah.
1399440	1400440	She's going to play ball.
1400440	1406960	And I'm leading the cat man into, and you guys go into the police station and there's
1406960	1410560	one open cell inside it is a blanket palette.
1410560	1416880	The other cells are filled with stuff that you guys took from the storage units.
1416880	1417880	Right.
1417880	1419720	I'm going to lead them both into the cell.
1419720	1421300	She is cracking up.
1421300	1425900	She thinks this is the funniest thing that's ever happened and she keeps saying things
1425900	1430980	to you like, who's gonna believe you?
1430980	1431980	No one.
1431980	1432980	Absolutely no one.
1432980	1433980	I think Drew believed me.
1433980	1436180	Drew, you believe me that this is a cat man?
1436180	1444140	Drew is pouring coffee onto the floor, missing his mug completely.
1444140	1445500	Another late night.
1445500	1446500	Um, yep.
1446500	1447500	See, he believes me.
1447500	1448500	You said cat man.
1448500	1449500	Yeah.
1449500	1450500	That's you believe me.
1450500	1451500	Drew, you believe me?
1451500	1452500	Yes.
1452500	1453500	Clark.
1453500	1454500	Sorry.
1454500	1455500	Officer Bishop.
1456100	1457100	Excuse me.
1457100	1458100	So we at least got something going here.
1458100	1462160	We're going to figure things out, but, uh, for now I just want you guys to rest in here.
1462160	1463160	Do you have their IDs?
1463160	1465340	Do you want me to start on the paperwork?
1465340	1467980	Uh, doctor, do you have your ID on you?
1467980	1468980	Yes, of course.
1468980	1470260	Can we get, can I borrow that?
1470260	1472060	She hands you her ID.
1472060	1474620	Doug is not wearing pants.
1474620	1475620	Yeah.
1475620	1478300	Uh, Drew, uh, we got hers.
1478300	1479780	Doug is a cat man.
1479780	1484780	Um, he doesn't have his ID on him, but, uh, if you'll run hers, you can run her husband
1484780	1485780	too.
1485780	1486780	You should check them up.
1486780	1487780	Doug Jacobs.
1487780	1488780	Okay.
1488780	1489780	Sounds good.
1489780	1491980	I'll, I'll start putting it in the system.
1491980	1498020	Thanks Drew.
1498020	1499020	All right.
1499020	1502260	So John and Keith arrive at the station.
1502260	1505220	I go to my desk and open up.
1505220	1509820	Hey everybody, look at Keith.
1509820	1514340	I run as fast as I can over to my desk and try to get the extra uniform out and just
1514340	1516180	put it on with my gown on.
1516180	1517420	I'm not even taking my gown off.
1517420	1519180	I'm just putting it on over my gown.
1519180	1520180	Okay.
1520180	1521180	Keith.
1521180	1527580	Hey, um, before you say anything, do we have an extra, um, set of keys to this particular
1527580	1528580	set of handcuffs?
1528580	1531580	Keith, are those your handcuffs?
1531580	1535220	Yes, but I lost the key to them.
1535220	1537860	Soldier boy handcuffed him up and stole his gun.
1537860	1541140	Oh, he's also out there with his uniform, so we should probably get on that.
1541140	1542140	That's nice.
1542140	1543140	Keith.
1543140	1544140	Pretty dangerous.
1544940	1548740	It sounds really bad, but it wasn't like, you know, it all happened pretty quickly.
1548740	1552580	I don't think the other, you could have stopped it from happening either.
1552580	1562860	He's an army man and now he's an honorary police officer for contingent.
1562860	1564160	We can spin this.
1564160	1568660	We can spin this so that it looks like we're improving the force while he's talking while
1568660	1569660	we're having the conversation.
1569660	1571420	I'm going in and finding the keys for the cuffs.
1571420	1572420	Yeah.
1572420	1580260	And then, uh, we'll have Keith Vigna, roll luck, 41 on a 60.
1580260	1581260	You find the keys.
1581260	1582260	So while I'm uncuffing him.
1582260	1586340	So before he got the jump on you, did you get a chance to talk to him, glean anything
1586340	1587340	from him?
1587340	1588340	Yeah.
1588340	1590100	So we talked, I asked him some questions about John Peters.
1590100	1591100	Hold on.
1591100	1594380	I don't remember exactly what I talked to him about.
1594380	1595380	Yeah.
1595380	1596380	Yeah.
1596380	1597380	He hit me in the head pretty hard.
1597380	1600860	So some of that conversation was a little bit of a blur, but for the most part we talked
1600860	1603420	about him being friends with John Peters.
1603420	1608860	He told me they played video games together, but I don't know why he was like peeking around
1608860	1612300	John Peters house cause they hadn't, they don't talk all the time, but he said they
1612300	1613340	hadn't talked in a while.
1613340	1616500	So he was poking around, but I started to not really believe that.
1616500	1621940	And as soon as I showed any kind of a, like that I wasn't believing him, he, that's when
1621940	1623460	it kind of turns into a blur.
1623460	1628260	You know, the guy that came in saying he was friends with John Peters also, he was trying
1628260	1629260	to find his keys.
1629260	1632700	So people keep trying to say that they're his friend and then get weird.
1632700	1633700	Yeah, that's true.
1633700	1639100	While you guys are having this discussion, Drew kind of walks over to John and he's like,
1639100	1641940	Hey, um, can I talk to you real quick in the back room?
1641940	1642940	Sure.
1642940	1643940	A little buddy.
1643940	1647140	You guys want to head out of the room real quick?
1647140	1653580	Anything you can say to me?
1653580	1659220	Drew leads you into the back room and he's like, Hey, um, you guys went out to, um,
1659260	1668060	to Splashylvania and you sent Lauren out there and she said that there was just blood and
1668060	1670180	gore everywhere.
1670180	1677540	Now I, I asked her if it, if it looked like a deer and she said no, but I convinced her
1677540	1682740	that it was just, uh, that we'd heard like a deer accidentally fell off a water slide.
1682740	1687820	But that is a, that's a hilarious excuse.
1687820	1688820	Thank you.
1688900	1690900	What happened?
1690900	1694580	Did you guys, what's going on, John?
1694580	1696820	Did you guys kill someone?
1696820	1697820	Yes and no.
1697820	1701420	Oh my God, Drew, you should have seen this shot.
1701420	1708820	It was fucking pretty as a picture, but it turns out Julie Maxwell, she killed old Leo.
1708820	1710940	Uh, so we had to shoot her.
1710940	1713380	Clark just, you know, right between the eyes.
1713380	1717860	Does this have to do with all the cocaine?
1717860	1718860	The what now?
1718860	1722100	John, I found all the cocaine in the lockup.
1722100	1724900	Oh God, it's been such a full day.
1724900	1730220	I got curious about what all was confiscated and John, that's a lot of money's worth of
1730220	1731220	cocaine Dean.
1731220	1732660	Aren't you glad it's off the streets?
1732660	1735060	Do you know how much there is?
1735060	1736060	How much it costs?
1736060	1740100	I mean, I'll, I'll have to have that information when I write up my report.
1740100	1742140	Oh, don't you worry about that one.
1742140	1745860	This is still an ongoing investigation, so you don't need to write anything up on that.
1745860	1746860	Okay.
1746860	1751780	Well, Drew, you know what, I'm going to, there's something big going on in contention.
1751780	1752780	I'm going to level with you.
1752780	1755340	We don't know what it is, but we've got it under control.
1755340	1756340	We're working towards it.
1756340	1758260	I feel like we're about to break this thing.
1758260	1759660	You know what would help a whole lot though?
1759660	1760660	What?
1760660	1761660	If we had Maggie around.
1761660	1762660	Yeah.
1762660	1766040	Drew, can you, can you do everything in your power to, that's, that's what I want you.
1766040	1767660	Don't worry about these reports, man.
1767660	1769500	Just focus on finding the chief.
1769500	1771780	We need her leadership at a time like this.
1771780	1772780	Okay.
1772780	1773780	I will.
1773780	1774780	I will.
1775780	1790900	Um, you wouldn't, John, you, you wouldn't be interested in unloading that cocaine, would
1790900	1791900	you?
1794900	1797900	Is this some kind of test?
1797900	1798900	No.
1798900	1801020	John, I did the math.
1801020	1803780	That's millions of dollars worth of cocaine.
1803780	1807700	In fact, that's $10 million worth of cocaine.
1807700	1812100	That's what are you suggesting, Drew?
1812100	1822660	Well, I know that you have a bit of a history and uh, I mean, I slam them against the wall.
1822660	1826380	Drew, anything you think you know about me, you don't.
1826380	1829100	All right.
1829100	1830100	I'm just fucking with you.
1830100	1831100	Let's sell this cocaine.
1831100	1832100	Okay, thank God.
1832100	1833100	Holy shit.
1833420	1836820	We already have a buyer set up in the city and he's going to pay us $10 million.
1836820	1841060	If we get Keith and Clark in on it too, they can help out and that's two and a half million
1841060	1842060	dollars each.
1842060	1844260	I don't think we're going to get Clark in on this.
1844260	1845260	Okay, that's fine.
1845260	1848420	That's $3.3 million each, but that's going to be hard.
1848420	1852100	I don't know if we need to get Keith in on this.
1852100	1855740	That's $5 million each.
1855740	1856740	You and me, buddy.
1856740	1857740	Okay.
1857740	1863660	Well, there's, his name is the Duke and uh, we're gonna, we're waiting right now to hear
1863660	1865900	back from him on where to meet.
1865900	1869360	And he's got a glint in his eye of like pure ecstasy.
1869360	1872260	You are a much more interesting man than I figured you for.
1872260	1875540	We're going to be millionaires, Jon.
1875540	1876540	That's right.
1876540	1879460	We're going to be millionaires.
1879460	1883180	Both of us.
1883180	1884780	And he's just like giggling.
1884780	1885980	He's very happy.
1885980	1888180	And then he's like, also, I fixed the four wheeler.
1888180	1889180	Hell yeah, buddy.
1889180	1890180	Okay.
1890180	1891180	Okay.
1891180	1893540	Uh, we'll, we'll talk about this later.
1893540	1894540	Okay.
1894540	1901460	Well, um, yeah, if you do breathe a word of this to anybody else, I'll kill you.
1901460	1902460	So don't.
1902460	1903460	Okay.
1903460	1904460	Okay.
1904460	1905460	Okay.
1905460	1906460	Okay.
1906460	1907460	Oh boy.
1907460	1908460	Okay.
1908460	1909460	Cool.
1909460	1910460	Yeah.
1910460	1911460	Okay.
1911460	1912460	Bye.
1912460	1915460	And he walks back out into the room.
1916140	1922740	Drew comes back out from the back room while you guys are having the conversation.
1922740	1926340	Jon comes out shortly after good news guys drew fix the four wheeler.
1926340	1927340	Hell yeah.
1927340	1928340	Vroom, vroom.
1928340	1929340	Okay.
1929340	1937860	So Clark, Clark, I believe you were asking Keith about his bad cop work.
1937860	1940180	He was just a better criminal than I was a cop.
1940180	1947740	I wasn't a bad cop, which means we really should find him.
1947740	1949660	How long ago did this all happen?
1949660	1950660	Two hours ago.
1950660	1953500	Did anybody at the hospital see where he went or no?
1953500	1955140	I looked at the security footage.
1955140	1958740	The only shot they got out of him was like him leaving the lobby, basically dressed as
1958740	1959740	me.
1959740	1960740	So nobody knows where he went.
1960740	1964320	Hey drew, in the last hour or two, you get any calls about us working on something you
1964320	1965740	had heard from us about?
1965740	1966740	Nope.
1966740	1969660	Let me double check that my car is still parked out front.
1969660	1970660	It is.
1970660	1971660	Cool.
1971660	1972660	So yeah, he didn't steal my car though.
1972660	1974540	So we got that going for us.
1974540	1976540	So why did you arrest them?
1976540	1979860	You know, it was real confusing at the time.
1979860	1982860	At the very least it seemed like things weren't right.
1982860	1984380	So on a hunch.
1984380	1985980	He's got this real bad bloody nose.
1985980	1989580	So we, I mean, at the very least he's hurt.
1989580	1994820	Did she punch him or she says, so yeah, here's the, so she had the radio, right?
1994820	1997460	And she had the radio.
1997460	2000380	So back at the treasured place.
2000380	2001580	So she was the one who bought the radio.
2001580	2003400	So we went to see if she had the radio.
2003400	2004780	She said, no, somebody had taken it.
2004780	2005980	We said, who?
2005980	2010020	And she described a tall, angry surly man had come and taken it.
2010020	2011580	Did that ring any bells?
2011580	2012580	We think it's Charles.
2012580	2013580	Yeah.
2013580	2015240	We think you rung his bell earlier today.
2015240	2017020	Where would the radio be then?
2017020	2020660	We think it might be back at his hotel room, which we found out.
2020660	2021660	Yeah.
2021660	2022660	Okay.
2022660	2023660	And we haven't been there yet, have we?
2023660	2024660	We've not been there yet.
2024660	2025660	So that's kind of our biggest lead.
2025660	2029260	When he came in, he punched Salem Doug cap man.
2029260	2032160	How did this freaky Friday situation happen?
2032160	2033260	She blamed it on the radio.
2033260	2034260	Okay.
2034260	2035260	That makes sense.
2035260	2036260	Totally.
2036260	2037260	Let's you know what?
2037260	2041180	I'll go check out his apartment with the help of you guys.
2041180	2042180	Yes.
2042180	2043540	A hundred percent.
2043540	2047700	That should be our next step for the mystery, but we should probably find there's somebody
2047700	2049780	out there in your clothes.
2049780	2053020	How would you suggest we, I don't know.
2053020	2054020	Oh dude.
2054380	2059380	And call call for him and see if he answers my radio walkie talkie, whatever it is.
2059380	2063780	Oh, send out a call on the radio that sets up an irresistible trap for him.
2063780	2064780	Ooh.
2064780	2065780	I like that.
2065780	2066780	I like that too.
2066780	2067900	Got a good head on you, John.
2067900	2070340	So we know he was looking for John Peters, I think.
2070340	2075540	So maybe we should say that John Peters is somewhere and then he won't be there, but
2075540	2076540	we will.
2076540	2077540	Yeah.
2077540	2082140	We're like a free buffet for soldiers with John Peters.
2082140	2085140	John Peters is hosting a free buffet for soldiers.
2085140	2087560	Charles had this guy in his trunk.
2087560	2088560	That's true.
2088560	2089740	So this guy might be out for vengeance.
2089740	2091700	He might be at the hotel already.
2091700	2093460	Did you tell him that you killed Charles?
2093460	2096820	I don't think if that came up so we can, yeah, we can see if he's poking around Charles's
2096820	2097820	place.
2097820	2098820	Okay.
2098820	2099820	Wonder where Charles first ran into this guy.
2099820	2101460	You know, where did he abduct him?
2101460	2103200	He didn't remember.
2103200	2106320	I think when I asked him, I think I might've suffered a concussion too.
2106320	2111440	So some of these details are a little, little off for me here, but I feel fine now.
2111440	2112600	Just don't let me go to sleep.
2112600	2113880	That's actually outdated information.
2113880	2114880	Oh, okay.
2114880	2120480	I'm going to take a nap in the back of the cruiser then while we are at the motel.
2120480	2121600	How are you feeling on that foot?
2121600	2122600	Much better.
2122600	2126720	I can walk, but I am not back to where I was, but I will get there soon.
2126720	2128360	We can probably take three cars then.
2128360	2129360	I can drive.
2129360	2130360	Yeah.
2130360	2134680	So you would remember that Billy said that his last memory was looking in a window at
2134680	2135680	John Peters house.
2135680	2140600	At least that's what he told me, but I had a pretty reasonable suspicion about him and
2140600	2143360	kind of confronted him on it and that's what started the violence.
2143360	2147760	If he's telling the truth though, he might've been caught snooping around outside the house
2147760	2150360	by Charles, who was also snooping.
2150360	2151940	That's what I was probably thinking.
2151940	2155320	Did he say why he was snooping, why he was looking around the windows?
2155320	2159420	He said that John Peters is his friend and they play video games together and he hadn't
2159420	2162840	heard from him in a while, so he went over to check it out, but that's kind of when his
2162840	2167200	story started not making a whole lot of sense.
2167200	2168280	How old is John Peters?
2168600	2171720	John Peters is 30 years old.
2171720	2175920	And Billy, Billy Harrison is probably around that same age, right?
2175920	2177560	I think his ID said he was 31.
2177560	2178560	Yeah.
2178560	2180720	It makes sense that those guys would play video games together.
2180720	2185260	I got the feeling that that was either a half truth or just a story.
2185260	2189040	It raised my suspicion because I was thinking of John Peters as like an old man.
2189040	2190040	Okay.
2190040	2191040	Yeah.
2191040	2193600	Can you remember any specifics about how his story started falling apart?
2193600	2195520	Do you remember where you caught him?
2195560	2199360	Well, they had grown up together, I think, and then for a long time had just been playing
2199360	2202600	video games together and they weren't like super close friends.
2202600	2207460	So it was just strange that he would feel the need to go to his house, especially when
2207460	2210040	all of this crazy stuff is going on.
2210040	2213440	And then it was, it made me even more suspicious when he attacked me.
2213440	2218300	I was like something, I don't think this guy's just telling the whole truth.
2218300	2219300	This fella.
2226520	2230440	All right, fellas, I guess we should head to the hotel first.
2230440	2233520	Hotel Motel.
2233520	2236240	Can we call the Motel Hotel Motel?
2236240	2237240	Holiday.
2237240	2238240	Motel.
2238240	2239240	Motel.
2239240	2245680	Okay, so if you want to continue the evening doing adventure investigating type stuff,
2245680	2247040	you'll all lose some willpower.
2247040	2248040	That's right.
2248040	2249040	He already said it was late.
2249040	2250040	We have to go to sleep soon.
2250040	2252620	I feel like we should go now though because it's while it's fresh.
2252620	2254640	And that guy's out there in green uniform.
2254640	2257120	We really need to hire some more cops in this town.
2257120	2259560	Well, we potentially have a fourth one.
2259560	2260560	Just depends on what he's doing.
2260560	2263800	If he's doing crime or if he's, yeah, what if he's out there just doing our jobs?
2263800	2266400	Like maybe we should just let him keep at it.
2266400	2267400	Seems competent.
2267400	2271460	Did we ever figure out where he was, what country he was a soldier for?
2271460	2275300	He might be an Al-Qaeda.
2275300	2278960	You got your ass kicked by a Canadian soldier.
2278960	2279960	He's a Mountie.
2279960	2281260	Billy's a pretty Russian name.
2281260	2282860	You said we were going to lose willpower.
2282860	2283860	How much?
2283900	2284900	Just to get that back.
2284900	2285900	I can't remember mechanically.
2285900	2286900	Sleep.
2286900	2287900	Sleep, right?
2287900	2288900	You regain it when you sleep?
2288900	2289900	Okay.
2289900	2291580	So a full night's rest regains one D six willpower.
2291580	2292580	Okay, cool.
2292580	2294180	How much are we going to lose if we stay up?
2294180	2298860	You're going to lose one willpower per hour that you stay up starting now.
2298860	2300860	So everybody lose one willpower.
2300860	2303620	Good thing none of us are magic users.
2303620	2313020	For the listeners, willpower is one of the statistics in this game that is used for keeping
2313020	2320720	your shit together when going through a mental disorder or staying up late or trying to resist
2320720	2324700	interrogation or anything of that nature.
2324700	2329940	It'll also maybe come in handy when spells are introduced.
2329940	2333780	If they are willpower is also used for that.
2333780	2334780	Pew pew.
2334780	2339120	If we were actually just three guys trying to go find this guy, we'd all go out in separate
2339120	2342100	cars and just like search the town, I guess.
2342100	2344140	Do you trust me to do that?
2344140	2349260	As a, as your character, would you trust Keith to go out looking for the guy that bested
2349260	2350460	him last time?
2350460	2354660	As long as you radioed in when you found him and didn't move to engage.
2354660	2356380	Where else would you want to check out then?
2356380	2359900	Well, we have to go to the hotel too and like maybe sooner rather than later, but that can
2359900	2363540	also just be the first place we look for him and we could all take separate routes to it.
2363540	2369060	Do that and then split up if he's not at the hotel motel, then we can split up and cruise
2369060	2370060	around.
2370060	2371060	I like that.
2371060	2372060	Yeah.
2372060	2373060	And then figure it out from there.
2373060	2374060	Cool.
2374060	2375180	Uh, we do want to take all separate routes.
2375180	2376180	Oh cool.
2376180	2380340	Uh, and you're taking separate routes to look for this guy on the way to the establishment.
2380340	2384660	Well, everybody, uh, how are we going to do this?
2384660	2388180	Let's go ahead and get a luck roll from each of you first.
2388180	2389180	Pass.
2389180	2391180	20 on a 50.
2391180	2392180	Uh, pass.
2392180	2394180	51 on a 70.
2394180	2397380	37 on a, what are we rolling?
2397380	2398380	Luck.
2398380	2399380	60.
2399380	2400380	That's a lucky night.
2400580	2404860	I need all three of you to roll search for me.
2404860	2405860	Fail.
2405860	2406860	Crit fail.
2406860	2407860	We all.
2407860	2408860	Perfect.
2408860	2418820	We're all feeling really good and then each of you feels like you just missed him.
2418820	2421340	I feel him in the night.
2421340	2422420	Hot.
2422420	2428380	As you all converge at hotel motel, Keith's current home, you arrive in the parking lot.
2428380	2431460	It's midnight and there are a couple cars.
2431460	2435700	If I could get an intelligence roll from the person with the highest intelligence, I'm
2435700	2441980	at a 55, 75, 50, 92 on a 75.
2441980	2444140	Nothing seems out of the ordinary.
2444140	2445420	Another night at hotel motel.
2445420	2448420	Do I recognize any of the cars from living there?
2448420	2453060	Seems to you like all the ones that are normally there, there there's, you know, eight, 10
2453060	2454060	cars there.
2454060	2455060	There's some new ones.
2455060	2457300	Do we have a room number and the keys to the room?
2457300	2460540	You have your keys to your room and to Charles's.
2460540	2463200	You also have the key to Charles room.
2463200	2464200	What is my room number?
2464200	2465200	What's his room number?
2465200	2466200	What's your room number?
2466200	2467200	One Oh eight.
2467200	2468200	Cool.
2468200	2469200	What do you guys think?
2469200	2471060	Do you think that the room number would be on the key?
2471060	2476140	I mean, depends on what kind of key it is, but if it's a real key, it's a real key.
2476140	2477140	Then yeah.
2477140	2482400	It's a real key with a rubber little thing on it that says two Oh two.
2482400	2483620	Welcome to my home guys.
2483620	2485220	This is a real shit hole.
2485220	2486940	I thought you would never come visit me.
2486940	2488820	It was very sad that you live here.
2488820	2489820	It's just temporary.
2489820	2491500	You've been saying that for months.
2491500	2495980	I like try not to get a lump in my throat and go up to two Oh two.
2495980	2496980	I know the way guys.
2496980	2518940	How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you heaven knows how
