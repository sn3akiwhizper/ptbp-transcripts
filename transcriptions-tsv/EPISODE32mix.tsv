0	9840	Well, well, well, I see y'all are crawling back for more Wolf the Dog, and it don't matter
9840	17640	if I'm broadcasting in contention, the city, or anywhere else in the galaxy, everybody
17640	20640	always wants a taste of ol' Wolfy Boy.
20640	30640	Well, I am here hittin' you live from 694.2 PTBP to let y'all feast upon my mouth sounds.
30640	35480	I hope it's real satiatin' for y'all.
35480	41320	This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Dr. Colossus, who is an honorary police officer
41320	47080	on our Patreon and a member of the community over on the subreddit.
47080	53600	They tagged atpretendingpod in a tweet, which is just about the sweetest thing to ol' Wolf.
53600	55920	Dr. Colossus writes,
55920	59280	Time for ol' Wolf to come clean, my pups.
59280	65400	The audio adventures of the contention PD are just a cover to distract from my own insidious
65400	69240	efforts to dominate the national radio landscape.
69240	75320	Today contention, tomorrow the city, later on the world.
75360	79400	I can tell you this now because it's too late to stop it.
79400	85880	There's nowhere to hide as my hypnotic suggestions surf the electromagnetic waves straight into
85880	89900	your ear holes and hack your brain stems.
89900	92760	My dominion is nearly absolute.
92760	98520	Remember, the trigger phrase is plate of foot meat.
98520	102700	Thank you, Dr. Colossus, for ruining the surprise.
102700	108620	My producer and I were going to start by buying out all the local radio stations in
108620	116020	every small town so that Wolf the dog could have a grassroots movement of domination.
116020	120000	Then I'd begin the persuasion.
120000	123220	Real nice, real slow, you see.
123220	125580	I got time.
125580	129580	There's no one else for them to even listen to.
129580	135660	Draw them all in with hunnied words and promises of infinite foot meat.
135660	142620	Then, when the time was right, well, y'all just gonna have to wait and see, I guess.
142620	147620	Remember, if you want to write up something for your old wolf to how, tag at Pretending
147620	153700	Pod on Instagram or Twitter, tag Pretending To Be People on Facebook, or write a five-star
153700	159260	review and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.
159260	165380	Y'all, I need that positive motivation from you beautiful people because life in the city
165380	166780	is strange.
166780	170900	Yesterday, I saw two pigeons eating a rat.
170900	175700	Whenever I went over to try and scare them away, they hissed at me like a rabid raccoon
175700	177700	before skittering off.
177700	179300	They didn't even fly, y'all.
179300	182020	They just ran away real fast.
182020	186860	Please remember, my dear listeners, we got ourselves a Patreon now.
186860	191380	The link is in the show notes, and if you can't support us with your money, please write
191380	196540	a review on iTunes, and if you already wrote a review, please steal your friends' phones
196540	201900	and write a review on their iTunes, and if you don't have friends, go to the nearest
201900	207100	Apple store and write a review on iTunes from every phone and tablet on display in the whole
207100	213420	fuckin' place, and while you're there, grab that aux cord that's connected to the speaker
213420	218100	system and warn everyone that shit is about to slap.
218100	237540	It's KOTSU with no bap-a.
237540	238540	Spank me.
238540	239540	Flank me.
239540	242540	Call me stanky.
242540	246460	Stinky.
246460	250380	That means you yourself admit it yourself that you love your mother-in-law.
250380	254140	Are you ready?
254140	255140	Yeah.
255140	259340	John Lee Pettymore, you are standing outside a storage unit.
259340	263580	A massive yellow symbol has been spray painted on the door.
263580	269160	The symbol is a wonky question mark with two lines, one curved and one straight, jutting
269160	271860	down from the question mark's dot.
271860	278260	The storage unit door slides up, and inside is the thick brush of well-wooded land.
278260	280880	In the distance, you see a small cabin.
280880	285580	Looking down, your hands are covered in blue paint, and you are holding one of those small
285580	287280	silver spheres.
287280	289180	It feels warm in your hands.
289180	291580	It has a nice weight to it.
291580	294860	And then you see a sky of endless darkness.
294860	300020	Far out in front of you, through this thick and terminable nothing, you see two children
300060	305240	standing completely still, holding hands, and you hear the sounds of torment.
305240	311900	Agony and loss in an audio medium, you lose the ability to see, smell, feel anything as
311900	316100	the wretched noise overwhelms your senses.
316100	323140	You open your eyes, and you're staring up at a ceiling, and you look to the left, you
323140	326340	look to the right, and you see corpses.
326340	334300	And it smells overwhelmingly like blood and viscera and death and shit, other bodily fluids
334300	336700	spilled out.
336700	340380	You see the body of John Lee Pettymore IV.
340380	344300	Your body, but not your current body.
344300	351980	And you see the body of Rich Nichols, the man that led you from room to room in this
351980	354580	layer of Marvin Glass.
354580	355580	What do you do?
355620	359460	I look down at my new body, and what do I see?
359460	364620	Well honestly, the body of Kevin, or as we'll call him, John Lee Pettymore.
364620	366340	I guess I'd like to find a mirror.
366340	367340	Okay.
367340	374940	One of the files in this room, one of the file cabinets, has the front of it is actually
374940	378500	reflective, extremely reflective.
378500	387540	Looking in, you see this man who is, he looks like a broken version of your daddy that you
387540	395180	knew from when you were a child, a very young child, but he is much older.
395180	399940	He may be my father, but he ain't my daddy.
399940	406700	You see you have you to now have surgical scars all down your neck and jawline on either
406700	416100	side and these crazy eyes, and you're just an older man, basically the same build, you
416100	419540	still have a mustache, you know there's a lot of similarities.
419540	423980	I want to look at my old body and see where I came out of.
423980	424980	Oh yeah.
424980	431740	So it's very clear that you came out of the back of the neck.
431740	432740	Okay.
432740	433740	What do I feel like?
433740	437780	Do I feel like a person or like something wrapping itself around a host?
437780	439860	Well you feel like you've always felt.
439860	440860	Okay.
440860	441860	Makes sense.
441860	447580	So I, John Lee Pettymore kind of shudders as he looks at his old body.
447580	452260	I want to, I want to basically pretend to be Kevin as long as I can.
452260	453260	Okay.
453260	459620	So let's discuss the mechanical changes out of character for John Lee Pettymore the third.
459620	460620	Yeah.
460620	462660	What am I now?
462660	467980	So as I've described on the last two episodes for the other boys, we have, we've decided
467980	474980	to adapt some of the rules from Pulp Cthulhu, fold them into this campaign and in doing
474980	482260	so, we have given each of the PCs two talents from the Pulp Cthulhu rule book.
482260	487940	Thomas, you chose quick healer and this game we roll one D four to get new hit points for
487940	493780	each day and in your case you'll get one D four plus three every day.
493780	497180	And then you also chose clairvoyance.
497180	504020	Basically how we're going to do that is I'm going to trust you to not use this every second
504020	505020	that we're playing the game.
505020	506020	That's a mistake.
506020	509100	Yeah, I think that's fair, but here's what I'm gonna allow you to do.
509100	516140	You can spend 10 luck at any point in time to like dive into your internal self and have
516140	517140	a vision.
517140	518140	Cool.
518140	522100	Also with your, uh, with your character for the stuff you hit a breaking point yesterday
522100	523100	as well, I believe.
523100	526620	Um, no, I've got 22.
526620	527620	As your breaking point?
527620	531020	No, 20 is my breaking point and it's, it's very hard to see.
531020	532020	Right.
532020	535220	So that means you're actually extremely close to your 28.
535220	536380	There's no way that's a 28.
536380	537380	It's a 22.
537380	538380	Okay.
538660	540620	So you're extremely close to your third breaking point.
540620	542060	What happens on your third breaking point?
542060	545100	Well, we will hit that when we get there.
545100	549620	However, on your, uh, on your first breaking point, when we did that, we had the idea that
549620	554540	you were going to have to put your life in danger to save others.
554540	559100	Basically you were going to throw yourself in harm's way to, to save others.
559100	564800	And if you didn't, then there would be a willpower disadvantage for you the next day that is
564800	572760	going to be subsumed by this next breaking point situation, which is when you roll sanity,
572760	579000	if you fail and the role would also fail on a power check, what's your power 60.
579000	587080	So if you roll on a sanity check and you roll over 60, then you are going to split into
587080	591080	a mind and a body at odds with each other.
591080	592720	Okay.
592720	600120	And that is a, uh, a load of role-playing that I am heaping onto your very, uh, capable
600120	601120	talents.
601120	602120	All right.
602120	603120	I believe in you.
603120	608600	Let's remember that mechanic.
608600	614240	You walked into this room and it was filled with filing cabinets and my file was sitting
614240	615240	out open.
615240	620920	John Lee Pettymore IV's file was sitting out open on the table as was a file regarding
620920	623920	some people that ended up being Kevin.
623920	629440	As you were like getting up and looking around this room in your new body, you hear a voice
629440	633520	from behind you, Hey, Kevin, come on.
633520	635040	Marvin wants to talk to us.
635040	639120	So without saying anything, I just told up one finger, like, wait a second.
639120	644040	And I want to real quick see if, um, I can find a file for Clark and Keith.
644040	645040	Okay.
645040	647880	Go ahead and roll search for me.
647880	648880	35.
648880	651920	Uh, let's see what my search is.
651920	652920	50.
652920	653920	All right.
653920	654920	Then you were good.
654920	660560	And actually, um, in your new body, we're going to up your hit points and willpower
660560	664840	all the way to full full for a John Lee Pettymore full for John Lee Pettymore.
664840	665840	Okay.
665840	667800	We're going to keep all your mix.
667800	668800	Yeah.
668800	669800	All your takes after his dad.
669800	670800	Yeah, exactly.
670800	673640	Ooh, that puts me up to 20 hit points and 12 willpower.
673640	674640	Okay.
674640	675960	So yeah, I passed the search rule.
676040	681160	So you open this most reflective file cabinet and it just so happens to have three file
681160	683400	names that catch your eye.
683400	688360	One says Clark Bishop and it is completely empty.
688360	693260	Another says Keith Vigna and it too is completely empty.
693260	699320	Both of these file folders are, they're like extremely crisp and new.
699320	705800	Then like the third folder you find titled the contention PD, which is so worn, it is
705800	710120	turned a noticeably different color, uh, opening it.
710120	717520	You see a lot of recent news stories, file clippings, uh, newspaper clippings that are
717520	724600	cut out and put into this folder and they all have to do with the police force and whether
724600	730480	or not you guys weren't handling missing persons cases or you were firing weapons into
730480	734920	the air in public or you were harassing citizens.
734920	739840	There are plenty of news articles written about the contention PD that have come out
739840	745600	in the past three or four days that have been grouped into this folder.
745600	753640	Uh, John Lee Pettymore, the third and fourth letters of fake news, um, and, and stashes
753680	756080	the file back where he found it and follows Rosemary.
756080	763480	So you guys go out the hallway into the elevator and I want to, I want to try out Kevin, like
763480	765720	some spy craft as Kevin.
765720	770080	So I'm just going to be like, uh, how you doing Rosemary?
770080	776440	Well, uh, everything's going exactly as planned, so pretty fucking good Kevin.
776440	777680	That's that's great.
777680	780560	It's not out of character for me to ask you how you're doing, is it?
780560	784840	I mean, we haven't chatted like this in years, but well, it's a good day.
784840	785840	Everything's going as planned.
785840	786840	Yeah.
786840	787840	I wasn't going to question it.
787840	788840	What part of the plan are we at?
788840	789840	What do you mean?
789840	791320	Where are you on your part of the plan?
791320	793880	I know where I am, but what have you, what have you accomplished?
793880	799000	Well, I think that's why we're, uh, I think that's why we're going to see Marvin for us.
799000	801480	He's probably going to send us to go collect the money now.
801480	802480	Great.
802480	803480	Perfect.
803480	804480	Yeah.
804480	808760	So you guys make it to the top of the, uh, elevator ride and the door opens and there's
808760	814960	a long hallway and at the end of the hallway, there is a 10 by 10 slab of black marble and
814960	821020	four guards, two on either side of the enormous and strange door that slowly slides open as
821020	822020	you approach.
822020	827240	And the guards are in full brown jumpsuits and they each have a large scythe strapped
827240	828240	to their backs.
828240	831280	And the blade of each scythe is shaped like an enormous fish hook.
831280	836800	A closer look reveals these men have unnatural matching faces.
836840	840200	Their eyes are far apart, almost on either side of their face.
840200	845400	Their noses do not jut out, but are rather two slits above their two wide thick lipped
845400	846480	mouths.
846480	849920	And they have a few flaps on either side of their necks.
849920	852920	Fish man.
852920	853920	Walking into this.
853920	855320	I knew it.
855320	856320	This whole time.
856320	857320	I knew it.
857320	858320	It was the fish.
858320	859320	All right.
859320	863880	When you walk into this room, you see it's the size of a basketball court to your left.
863960	866880	One of the long walls is entirely made of glass.
866880	872640	And there is murky greenish water on the other side, like an aquarium, but it's of staggering
872640	873640	proportions.
873640	880200	Marvin Glass is standing behind a table, arms folded behind his back, staring off into the
880200	881200	distance.
881200	885560	And again, he is just massive and gaunt all at the same time.
885560	889240	And he is still wearing that fitted black tuxedo that you've seen him before.
889480	896160	And when you turn, you see his weird hole in his face where his mouth should be is still
896160	899320	just covered in this circle of red lipstick.
899320	901360	And that hole begins moving.
901360	903440	Hello, Kevin.
903440	905920	Hello, Rosemary.
905920	906920	And Nod.
906920	912320	You have been doing excellent work for me recently.
912360	921160	And we are moving into the final phase of contentions demolition.
921160	925360	I need the two of you to go retrieve.
925360	931520	And as he's saying this, you notice that behind them, there are these windows and you see
931520	935600	lights, just like crazy lights, just like shining in and off.
935600	940680	It looks like there's something happening in that room behind him, but you can't quite
940680	941680	tell what it is.
941680	946960	Whatever it is, there's a lot of movement with the lights and it's getting out of control
946960	947960	back there.
947960	948960	Kevin, thanks.
948960	953560	I'll probably hear that in another episode.
953560	962140	Looking around the room, you see that on Marvin's desk, there is one of those small silver spheres
962140	968520	sitting on like a little tripod holder that's holding it up.
968520	973800	That's awesome because I knew he had one from the tape and now I don't have to go looking
973800	974800	for it.
974800	975800	It's right there.
975800	976840	You can see it.
976840	983840	And he continues on saying the money, as Rosemary said, and Rosemary cuts in.
983840	993780	Yeah, let's see, there's $5 million in the police station and then there's $5 million
993780	998240	at the house of one of the police officers.
998240	1002960	That is extremely good work, Rosemary.
1002960	1007800	I just have one request on your way to contention.
1007800	1013600	I need you to go check in on a new venture I've begun.
1013600	1021640	You see, Stan Manstein, his daughter's funeral is today.
1021640	1028680	I believe it begins rather shortly and he will be out in the world for the first time
1028680	1031540	in a very long time.
1031540	1039720	I have sent your new Charles, Keith Vigna, one of the officers from the contention police
1039720	1046080	department, to go bring Stan Manstein back to me.
1046080	1054720	Rosemary and Kevin, I need you to go make sure that our new family member completes
1054720	1056320	his job.
1056320	1057880	Not again.
1057880	1061880	Kevin thinks it's very appropriate that Vigna is the new Charles considering he killed the
1061880	1062880	first one.
1062880	1066320	Oh shit, I didn't even think about that.
1066320	1067320	That's so good.
1067320	1072920	He's like, that's justice for Keith in some small measure.
1072920	1077400	While we're all still in front of Marvin Glass, I want to clear my throat.
1077400	1081000	He turns quickly and looks at you.
1081000	1090140	I heard Rosemary brought the gun instead of the money we're going to get.
1090140	1092040	Why'd you do that, Rosemary?
1092040	1099120	They both look at you and Rosemary turns and starts laughing.
1099120	1101480	I know I'm not very quick, but...
1101480	1106480	And she looks at Marvin and she's like, that's why we don't trust old Kevin here with making
1106480	1108360	the plans, huh, sir?
1108360	1109920	And Marvin laughs.
1109920	1123440	I guess so.
1123440	1128520	My attempt to shame Rosemary in front of Marvin has failed miserably.
1128520	1136720	I was really trying to sow some division, but nope.
1136720	1137720	I think you did great.
1137720	1143560	So he kind of, with a flick of his hand, waves you off and the door moves back out of the
1143560	1150640	way and you guys take the elevator back up to the top after loading up with some heavy
1150640	1153080	artillery, I would assume.
1153120	1158480	Rosemary, you know I'm because of what they've done to my brain.
1158480	1160680	I don't remember the plans too well.
1160680	1163680	Why did you get the gun instead of the money?
1163680	1169560	Well, okay, well, I already got in a shootout with those police officers and they did not
1169560	1170560	stop.
1170560	1174200	Like, I thought for sure that they were going to keep going until they just blew my brains
1174200	1176320	onto the concrete.
1176320	1180340	And I don't trust them to have not stopped the second time.
1180340	1184300	And so I obviously not wanting to get shot, I hate getting shot.
1184300	1185940	You know, I hate getting shot.
1185940	1189380	So I, you know, just figured that was the easiest way.
1189380	1195060	Kevin grunts, but John Lee Pettymore or the thing that was John Lee Pettymore is pretty
1195060	1197940	pleased that she was like actually intimate.
1197940	1201340	Like we were something of a force to be reckoned with at least.
1201340	1202340	Right.
1202340	1203340	Yeah.
1203340	1204340	Some sort of fry.
1204340	1208660	We, yeah, we made some small impact in her plans.
1208660	1214460	So as you guys, uh, the elevator opens and then all of a sudden you are just standing
1214460	1221580	in an alleyway in the city and the sun is shining in kind of bright from the, from a
1221580	1230080	low angle and there's fog in this alleyway and you look over and you see a group of raucous,
1230080	1235200	like rowdy people, like people that you wouldn't expect at 10 AM, but maybe in the city that's
1235200	1236320	more normal.
1236320	1240960	There's at least 12 of them and they all walk up to this, uh, this alleyway that you're
1240960	1247740	in and there's a large grate on the ground and they all stand on it and they all hold
1247740	1253600	up their dirty dog key fobs at the same time and the grate seems to disappear and they
1253600	1256640	all just fall straight down into it.
1256640	1257980	Interesting.
1257980	1261600	These dirty dog passes, they're like the key chains that John Peter said.
1261600	1262600	Yeah.
1262600	1263600	Okay.
1263600	1266120	And that's sitting in lockup, evidence lockup most likely.
1267120	1268120	Cool.
1268120	1275200	Turning away from that, Rosemary clicks the beeper on her white Toyota and the two of
1275200	1280640	you hop in and begin making your way to the city cemetery.
1280640	1297080	Luke, after leaving this meeting with Marvin Glass, you head back down the hallway into
1297080	1303680	the elevator that you came in on and you ride up to the top and it leads you back to the
1303680	1310840	parking garage that you drove into when you came with your partners and Doug Jacobs and
1310840	1313600	the body of agent Trent Chad and Rosemary.
1313600	1320200	And when you arrive up there, there are still the same guards up there wearing suits and
1320200	1327440	earpieces and your police cruiser from contention is also sitting exactly where it was before.
1327440	1329560	Do I see any of my friends?
1329560	1330880	No, you do not.
1330880	1333160	I go over to the car and I get in.
1333560	1338400	When you get into the car, you see that you had actually left your cell phone in here
1338400	1339400	this whole time.
1339400	1348880	I believe you're wearing a boat shoes and shoes, the oversized shorts that are teal.
1348880	1357500	I think some sort of way too tight orange polo, so you look great and you get back into
1357500	1362120	your cruiser and when you look at your cell phone, you see that you have a bunch of missed
1362120	1364800	calls and a voicemail from Drew Andrews.
1364800	1368200	Okay, I listen to the voicemail.
1368200	1375120	Oh, fuck, Keith, Keith, Keith, you got to get somebody, somebody please answer somebody
1375120	1376120	you guys.
1376120	1377120	Oh, fuck everybody.
1377120	1378400	It's everywhere now.
1378400	1382620	You have to tell everyone, everyone, please, please, you have to get as far away.
1382620	1385440	You have to get as far away as possible from here.
1385440	1386520	It's growing.
1386520	1387360	It's growing.
1387360	1393460	I want to call Drew.
1393460	1396120	When you call Drew, it goes straight to voicemail.
1396120	1397120	Fuck.
1397120	1405680	My first reaction is to drive back to contention, but he also said get away, but I got to go
1405680	1406680	save Drew.
1406680	1407680	Okay.
1407680	1409920	Oh, do I have the camera with me?
1409920	1416300	No, when you look inside the police cruiser, you find that it has been stripped of many
1416300	1418580	of the items that you came here with.
1418580	1419580	Okay.
1419580	1421420	And then what did we, who is the gun?
1421420	1422540	The gun's gone.
1422540	1424100	The gun is gone for sure.
1424100	1425100	Yeah.
1425100	1426100	Okay.
1426100	1432340	You've got some guns left, but not the gun, the tubed gun, not the tubed gun and the camera's
1432340	1433340	gone.
1433340	1434340	The camera's gone.
1434340	1435660	The body armor's all gone.
1435660	1436660	Okay.
1436660	1437660	Yeah.
1437660	1438660	You're just left with a couple of guns.
1438660	1443060	And then Marvin actually gave you your small, powerful gun.
1443060	1444060	When is this funeral?
1444300	1446540	Oh, it starts in like half a night.
1446540	1448260	You've just enough time to like make it there.
1448260	1449260	Okay.
1449260	1454220	I guess hopefully Drew calls me back or something, but I guess gonna head to this funeral if
1454220	1457100	I have just enough time, I guess I can't go get my dress clothes on.
1457100	1460500	So I'm going to be dressed for a different occasion, but.
1460500	1461500	Styling.
1461500	1462500	Yeah.
1462500	1463500	Maybe stand out like a sore thumb.
1463500	1464500	Maybe not.
1464500	1465500	We'll see.
1465500	1471020	So you, uh, you drive to the city cemetery and I don't know if Keith has been here before,
1471020	1473220	but the city cemetery is all.
1473380	1474740	Oh, it is in the city.
1474740	1475740	It is in the city.
1475740	1476740	Yeah.
1476740	1477740	And it's all above ground.
1477740	1479620	Oh, like a new Orleans style.
1479620	1480620	Exactly.
1480620	1485860	So there are, as you drive up, you park and then there are countless tombs winding aimlessly
1485860	1489420	about creating all these odd little pathways.
1489420	1493900	The mausoleums are just tall enough to look down on you as you pass through.
1493900	1498660	And the morning fog adds an extra layer of disorientation.
1498660	1506900	I'm kind of wandering through trying to find people and then I get a whiff of, is that,
1506900	1510700	it smells like a crawfish boil.
1510700	1514420	And I head to where the smell is coming from.
1514420	1520380	And as you head to, as you follow your nose, you find that in a small clearing, there is
1520380	1526700	a funeral service set up for Ari Manstein surrounded by these ornate and menacing graves.
1526700	1533220	There are a handful of rows of chairs, all facing a small podium next to a coffin.
1533220	1537820	And I'm going to hold up this whiteboard here and show you.
1537820	1539060	Okay.
1539060	1540580	Where would you like to...
1540580	1542020	Are those seats?
1542020	1544060	Yeah, the circles are seats.
1544060	1549420	I want to go to the very front row on the very middle.
1549420	1550420	Okay.
1550420	1552700	You head toward the front row.
1552700	1555020	Where's the crawfish boil pot at?
1555020	1556020	It is...
1556540	1558180	It's actually right in front of the coffin.
1558180	1559180	Okay, cool.
1559180	1560860	So once it's all done, I'll...
1560860	1561860	You want to be first in line.
1561860	1562860	I want to be first in line.
1562860	1563860	Absolutely.
1563860	1570420	And as you walk up there, Jan Manstein, the mother of Ari Manstein walks towards you to
1570420	1571420	greet you.
1571420	1572420	Oh my goodness.
1572420	1575300	Oh, I just, I didn't think you would come or maybe I did.
1575300	1579140	I thought maybe there was a chance that you weren't going to come, but you know, last
1579140	1583620	minute and then I don't know where your partners are, but this is just, I couldn't be any happier
1583620	1588540	or sadder technically, I guess I am at my daughter's funeral, but thank you.
1588540	1589540	Yeah, I wouldn't miss it.
1589540	1593060	The other police officers send their condolences.
1593060	1597060	They're a bit incapacitated right now though, but I wouldn't miss it for the world.
1597060	1603820	And she moves on flitting about to many of the other funeral attendees and you take a
1603820	1605260	seat in the front row.
1605260	1605780	Okay.
1613620	1617620	All right, yeah, I'm good.
1617620	1618620	Yeah, you are.
1618620	1619620	One of the best, they all say.
1619620	1622340	That's what literally everyone has agreed on.
1622340	1627380	We all came together, put our thumb on the thing, showed that we pledged our allegiance
1627380	1628380	to you.
1628380	1629380	I appreciate it.
1629380	1630380	Thank you.
1630380	1631380	Thank you everyone.
1631380	1643260	Clark, you just came to, on this table in the middle of this odd dungeon style room
1643820	1653420	and you are looking at chief Maggie cook or Maggie cook now, and she backs away from you
1653420	1654420	pretty quickly.
1654420	1661220	As soon as the weird squamous, like worm like creature with the mouths is back in the ground,
1661220	1664300	she steps back and she looks at you and she's, Oh, okay.
1664300	1665300	I didn't expect that.
1665300	1666300	Um, all right.
1666300	1673020	So Clark, you, um, are you, how you.
1673020	1680740	When you came back, I know we went over this, but how, how was it that you are still alive?
1680740	1684380	I mean, your, your guess is as good as mine.
1684380	1686060	In fact, I would hope it'd be better.
1686060	1687060	Okay.
1687060	1690580	Well I'll, I'll keep thinking on it and I'll let you know what I come to, but for now you
1690580	1691620	need to get going.
1691620	1697300	So basically as soon as you're finished up, you can do pretty much whatever.
1697300	1699180	You can head back to contention.
1699180	1700300	You can hang out in the city.
1700300	1705540	We'll put you up here if you'd rather stick around and be close, but this job isn't a
1705540	1708780	daily situation or it won't be at first.
1708780	1714460	We'll get you trained up and, uh, working more and more often, but for now you can pretty
1714460	1720340	much go back to contention, get your affairs in order and, uh, pack up everything because
1720340	1723180	your life there, it doesn't, doesn't have to stay there.
1723180	1724380	You can, you can move here.
1724380	1729140	You can, you can move wherever you need to be and, uh, and we'll, we'll stay in contact
1729140	1730500	with you either way.
1730500	1732220	You said it's not a daily thing.
1732220	1739780	I mean, the thing I saw, it, it, it shook me to my core, Maggie, I'll make it a daily
1739780	1740780	thing.
1740780	1741780	Let's, let's stop it.
1741780	1742780	Let's make it not be.
1742780	1743780	All right.
1743780	1744780	All right, Clark.
1744780	1745780	I like your passion.
1745780	1746780	I like your fire.
1746780	1750540	This is exactly what we need in this organization right now is fire.
1750540	1751740	All right.
1751740	1758180	So take this and she pulls a burner phone out of her pocket and she hands it to you.
1758220	1760420	Take this and I'll be in contact with you.
1760420	1763340	I'll, I'll, I'll hit you up tomorrow and I'll make sure that we get going.
1763340	1764340	All right.
1764340	1768900	Hey, hey Maggie, do you know anything about my partners?
1768900	1772020	No, no I don't.
1772020	1775380	They dropped off the radar about when you did.
1775380	1779140	So I have no idea what they're up to.
1779140	1785260	If they're, uh, if they're still with us and I had the opportunity, would you be willing
1785260	1787580	to take them into the circle with us?
1787580	1788580	Do you think they're ready?
1788580	1791300	I mean, they've seen the same things I have.
1791300	1793300	Yeah, but are they ready?
1793300	1795700	I don't know Maggie.
1795700	1797900	Will you be the judge of that?
1797900	1798900	Let me know.
1798900	1804700	All right, Clark, you being a part of this, that means I trust you.
1804700	1807620	We're going to rely on each other a whole lot moving forward.
1807620	1810580	So if you say they're ready, then I believe you.
1810580	1811580	All right.
1811580	1817460	I, I, I thank you Maggie and I hope you know that I've always, always trusted you.
1817460	1824980	I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have stuck around in that, that, that dead end job.
1824980	1830620	Well Clark, you're not at a, well, I guess you are still in a bit of a dead end job.
1830620	1834300	If poor choice of words, Maggie, at the end, we're all going to be dead.
1834300	1837340	So in order for that not to happen, let's get you moving.
1837340	1838340	All right.
1838340	1843020	And so she leads you back up top, back into the parking lot of the mill and sets you up
1843020	1844220	with a car.
1844220	1849900	It's a little silver Honda Accord and she hands you the keys.
1849900	1857220	What gear did you decide to bring from the, from the room that we were just in?
1857220	1859940	That room that spawned anything and everything that I would ever need.
1859940	1860940	Of course.
1860940	1861940	Yeah.
1861940	1862940	What'd you pick up?
1862940	1866060	All a news, a gun.
1866060	1869300	You guys have all those old contention police department uniforms in there.
1869300	1872220	I went ahead and got my old uni, an old uniform of mine.
1872220	1873220	Amazing.
1873220	1875140	I'm afraid in it still.
1875140	1880060	And uh, Oh, you got any of those, uh, Leon gave me this gun that shot these tranquilizer
1880060	1882860	darts that made people do things.
1882860	1884100	You got any of those left?
1884100	1885100	You know what?
1885100	1887380	Uh, we are actually out of that serum right now.
1887380	1891900	We just used the last of it to make sure we could get the federal Bureau of investigation
1891900	1892900	on our side.
1892900	1894920	We thought that might be quite important.
1894920	1900260	Do you have any leftover from when you were doing that or I believe, uh, the glass family
1900260	1902140	now possesses that item.
1902140	1903140	The glass family.
1903140	1904140	Oh boy.
1904140	1905140	Okay.
1905140	1911220	Well then this thing is a bit more convoluted than I, Hey Maggie, can I know why I'm killing
1911220	1912220	Stan?
1912220	1913220	Yeah.
1913220	1914220	He needs to die.
1914220	1915220	Okay.
1915220	1917500	Is that good enough for you right now?
1917500	1919640	I guess it's going to have to be.
1919640	1923020	And she turns around and walks back to the mill.
1923020	1924020	Cool.
1924020	1925020	Cool.
1925020	1926020	Cool.
1926020	1931260	So, uh, you hop in the car and you're heading off to the city cemetery and the car is actually
1931380	1932380	low on gas.
1932380	1936460	So you have to stop and fill it up on the way over there.
1936460	1941180	And while you're filling it up, I need you to roll an alertness check for me.
1941180	1943380	Ooh boy.
1943380	1945500	I pass a 32 on a 70.
1945500	1952340	So you feel this movement behind you as you're filling up this car, your car now, and you
1952340	1958740	turn around just in time to see that something has been dropped into the passenger seat of
1958740	1966860	your car from a woman who is now 10, 15 yards away and is running away from you.
1966860	1968860	Can I get any sense of who she is?
1968860	1970260	Any chance I've seen her before?
1970260	1971260	Just from the back.
1971260	1974420	It is an average build woman with dark hair.
1974420	1977880	I'm peeking in through my, the window I'm closest to, to see what's been dropped.
1977880	1980620	It looks like a cell phone.
1980620	1982620	Huh.
1982620	1985020	I go around and pick it up.
1985020	1989880	You walk around the car, open the door, pick up the cell phone and the cell phone immediately
1989880	1992940	buzzes with a text message.
1992940	1998940	And it says, do you want to know why your parents were killed?
1998940	2001940	Joe just made the funniest face.
2001940	2008260	It was like a, Ooh, mixed with like a what?
2008260	2012740	Uh, boy, I don't know.
2012780	2019180	I, uh, first of all, before I reply to anything, I want to do a, just a quick little look through
2019180	2020300	the menus on this phone.
2020300	2021460	Do I see anything else?
2021460	2025240	Old text messages, a sign of a phone number anywhere, contacts.
2025240	2029540	Looks like this phone is completely blank except for this one text that is now in your
2029540	2030540	inbox.
2030540	2032060	I just reply, who is this?
2032060	2033060	Okay.
2033060	2038360	And then you hop back in the car and head back on your way to the city cemetery.
2038360	2043880	And when you arrive, uh, I don't know if Clark has been to the city cemetery before, but
2043880	2047160	it is all above ground mausoleums and such.
2047160	2048160	Exactly.
2048160	2054400	So you pull up to a parking lot and then you walk in to the city cemetery underneath this
2054400	2060760	big gate that like old like iron rot that kind of spells city cemetery in the gate and
2060760	2067820	you walk through and you're now in these windy, endless seeming walkways that you're surrounded
2067820	2072960	by these tall tombs and mausoleums on either side that are looking down on you and it's
2072960	2075660	morning and there's fog all through.
2075660	2076660	Cool.
2076660	2077660	Yeah.
2077660	2087620	And, uh, eventually you, um, you smell this, um, fishy scent, this seafood scent of some
2087620	2088620	sort.
2088620	2093820	It smells almost like a, like a new Orleans party in the cemetery and you follow your
2093820	2097020	nose to a small clearing.
2097020	2105260	And my feet lift up off the ground and I float.
2105260	2110260	And as you approach, you can see that there in the distance, uh, there's a small clearing
2110260	2116380	and inside the clearing there's a funeral service set up for Ari Manstein, a handful
2116380	2122060	of rows of chairs and they're all facing a podium next to a coffin.
2122060	2126220	And you can probably see from where you're at, you're far enough away to where no one's
2126220	2130600	really paying attention to you so far, but looking in and you see Jan Manstein, the mother
2130600	2136260	of Ari and you see Keith Vigna and he is wearing Sperry's boat shoes.
2136260	2142620	I believe a blue coral shorts that are very small or big.
2142620	2145540	I can't quite remember.
2145540	2147260	And then I think they're too big.
2147260	2148260	That would make sense.
2148260	2153140	And then a, uh, like an orange polo that is extremely tight.
2153140	2155100	I don't know necessarily.
2155100	2158340	You don't know why he's wearing that, but that is what he's wearing.
2158340	2161800	How's he looking physically like in the face and maybe even his hair.
2161800	2167300	He looks pretty good from the, from a distance, you know, you can't really see, but you were
2167300	2170900	in the cage when you watched him die.
2170900	2175540	So this might be a confusing sight for old Clark Bishop.
2175540	2179380	Then again, you've been through some stuff.
2179380	2186680	You yourself perhaps might have an inkling that it's easier than you thought to come
2186680	2188060	back from the other side.
2188060	2189060	Who knows?
2189060	2190060	Oh, this makes sense.
2190060	2192100	So basically this is the setup.
2192100	2197540	I'm holding up a whiteboard with the setup and Keith is on the front row in front of
2197540	2198540	the coffin.
2198540	2204920	Uh, in front of the coffin, there is a crawfish crawdad boil going on, which is causing the
2204920	2209680	scent to be overwhelming in this area.
2209680	2213240	Is that as weird to Clark as it is to Joe?
2213240	2215280	It's as weird to you as it is to me.
2215280	2216280	Okay.
2216280	2217280	Yep.
2217280	2218280	Good.
2218280	2220420	I didn't know if that was a tradition that you knew about that I don't.
2220420	2226360	It's the classic city ritual that everyone knows about.
2226360	2230040	It was in your, uh, it was in your package that you were supposed to read before you
2230040	2231040	came in today.
2231040	2232040	Yeah.
2232040	2233040	Uh, Zach, it was a hundred pages.
2233040	2235600	I wasn't going to do that.
2235600	2237040	I just want you to be prepared.
2237040	2242040	So basically I, I, I need you to pick a spot to set up a where you're going to be.
2242040	2244100	You can, you know, so is there a crowd?
2244100	2245100	There is a crowd.
2245100	2246100	There is a crowd.
2246100	2247280	Do I see Stan?
2247280	2248280	You don't.
2248280	2249400	I'm going to not sit.
2249400	2251360	I'm going to stand toward the back of the chairs.
2251360	2252360	Okay.
2252360	2255840	You know, in a movie when the guy goes to the funeral that doesn't want to be seen at
2255840	2260400	the funeral and he's kind of amongst the trees, but he's not, he's not hiding per se.
2260400	2261400	Sure.
2261400	2262400	That's what I'm doing.
2262760	2264620	So you're amongst the trees, but there are no trees.
2264620	2270260	So are you in the back in open sight of everyone or are you going to kind of creep behind some,
2270260	2272760	some like one of the tombs that's nearby?
2272760	2277880	You could probably like hide behind a column or just like stand up against the column.
2277880	2281680	I don't want to be conspicuous enough that if somebody saw me, they would say, why is
2281680	2282780	that guy hiding?
2282780	2286080	So maybe more like just blending casually.
2286080	2289200	Maybe I'm leaning against a monosmoselium nearby.
2289200	2290200	Love it.
2290200	2291200	Yeah.
2291200	2292200	Nothing respects the dead like leaning on them.
2293000	2294000	Of course.
2294000	2295000	Okay.
2296000	2297000	Is my other partner there?
2297000	2299160	Do I see John Lee Pettymore with Keith?
2299160	2301800	You do not see John Lee Pettymore there.
2301800	2303800	Oh, okay.
2313800	2316520	Oh, they thought of me.
2316520	2326000	So John Lee Pettymore, the third and fourth and Kevin and Kevin, you are, you are on the
2326000	2330240	way to the city cemetery in the car with Rosemary.
2330240	2339040	And as you're driving there, she says, I, uh, I didn't, I didn't know that Charles was
2339040	2342760	dead until Marvin said that we'd replaced him.
2343000	2350080	And then I just looked it up on my phone and I saw that he, he died in contention.
2350080	2354840	And I know that the officers, the police there, they told me that they killed him, but I didn't
2354840	2355840	know.
2355840	2357280	I didn't know that they were serious.
2357280	2360160	I thought they might've been lying to try to get me to talk or something.
2360160	2367800	I didn't, I just didn't know that he was going to actually die.
2367800	2372120	I didn't know that you cared for nobody but yourself and the glass boy.
2372120	2378320	Oh, it's just, you know, he had the same, he had the same modifications done.
2378320	2383440	So I just thought that, you know, we were a little bit more robust than that.
2383440	2384440	Is that where are you?
2384440	2389000	I'm not that philosophical Rosemary, but okay.
2389000	2393200	I don't, I was trying to just suss out, but like how articulate was Kevin?
2393200	2394920	So you guys actually never heard him talk.
2394920	2402080	I would imagine that a guy like that is quite broken, but still easily like you can communicate
2402080	2403160	easily.
2403160	2407240	I would imagine you're not going to keep him around if he's just a dog on a leash basically.
2407240	2413480	So he, I think he's far more far more eloquent than even say Rosemary, you know, cause she's,
2413480	2417480	she's when you're, when you're right next to her, you see that she's got some scars
2417480	2420320	on her as well and she's able to keep up.
2420320	2421320	Got cool.
2421320	2422800	So she has had the same shit done, but yeah.
2422800	2423800	Gotcha.
2423800	2424800	Okay.
2424800	2425800	All right.
2425800	2426800	Hold on.
2426800	2429640	John, John Lee Pettimore talks like this and then you fuck up his body and his mind
2429640	2432280	and you put a bunch of years on it.
2432280	2443600	Rosemary, I'm not that philosophical, but did you think we, we couldn't die?
2443600	2445360	Everything dies.
2445360	2451520	And you guys pull up to the city cemetery and the city cemetery is all above ground.
2451520	2452520	Like New Orleans.
2452520	2453520	Exactly.
2453520	2458540	So you pull into a parking lot and the two of you begin walking through all these different
2458540	2464420	mausoleums and these little pathways that are winding endlessly to and fro about.
2464420	2469640	And it's morning and the sun's coming in at a low angle on this fog that is perpetuating
2469640	2472680	all throughout this entire cemetery.
2472680	2479340	As you're walking through you, you smell this like nice seafood, like crawfish, like scent,
2479340	2480340	like New Orleans.
2480340	2482100	It smells like New Orleans.
2482100	2489440	And following the scent, the two of you see from a distance, you hear a large group of
2489440	2493860	people and you see that there's a small clearing ahead where there's a funeral service set
2493860	2496460	up for Ari Manstein.
2496460	2501500	And it is surrounded by all these ornate and these, these menacing, these tall graves,
2501500	2506420	these tombs that are completely encasing this, this little clearing.
2506420	2511440	But inside there are a handful of rows of chairs that are all facing a small podium
2511440	2512720	next to a coffin.
2512720	2516080	And in front of the coffin is the crawfish boil.
2516080	2520240	You see that there is a Keith Vigna sitting on the front row.
2520240	2521240	How does Keith look?
2521240	2522460	Has he been modified?
2522460	2528640	From where you are, you can't tell whether he has been quote modified, but you can see
2528640	2536200	that he has regained an eyeball and his jaw, that he has regained his eyeball and his jaw.
2536200	2537500	And so that is different.
2537500	2543900	And he's also wearing a very tight fitting orange polo, like bright orange polo and these
2543900	2547980	massive coral shorts.
2547980	2549540	What's Keith's bod like?
2549540	2551500	He's still wearing those big pants.
2551500	2554420	Yeah, you still got him.
2554420	2556780	What's he like under that tight, tight polo?
2556780	2558220	Stringy, I think.
2558220	2559220	Yeah.
2559220	2560220	Beanie.
2560220	2561220	Beanie.
2561220	2567100	He's got a lean muscle on him, you know, he's like a horse.
2567100	2570020	That seems like a high compliment.
2570020	2572140	He's like a stringy horse.
2572140	2574420	It's like a sick horse.
2574420	2576580	In a polo.
2576580	2580100	I would love to see horses play polo.
2580100	2582620	Wait, on top of other horses?
2582620	2585900	No, that wouldn't work, but if they carried the sticks in their mouths.
2585900	2589620	I was picturing horses on people who are running.
2589620	2594220	It wouldn't work, Zach, but if you glued a stick to a horse's mouth and taught him to
2594220	2595220	whack a ball.
2595220	2600580	I think they would invent polo naturally.
2600580	2604220	It's probably the first game they come up with.
2604220	2609140	Anthropologists look at horse cultures and see if they've come up with polo to determine
2609140	2610700	how advanced they are.
2610700	2611700	Horsey culture.
2611700	2613500	See, you and Rosemary are looking for...
2613500	2614500	Horsey culture.
2614500	2615500	Did you see that Brony documentary?
2615500	2616500	Thankfully, no.
2616500	2617500	Don't you mean they?
2617500	2618500	Oh, no.
2618500	2619500	I'm sorry.
2619500	2629540	So, you see there are these handful of rows of chairs and Keith is up front.
2629540	2632660	He's sitting in the very front row in front of the coffin.
2632660	2638460	And as you continue to look around, go ahead and roll a search for me.
2638460	2639980	84, fail.
2639980	2647960	You notice there are lots of people here for the funeral and in the back, leaning up against
2647960	2651520	one of the mausoleums is Clark Bishop.
2651520	2658640	He is wearing an old contention police uniform, like an older model of the contention police
2658640	2660680	department uniform.
2660680	2663440	And he is just leaning casually in the very back.
2663440	2664440	What do you want to do?
2664440	2667280	Oh, first of all, is Stan Manstein in attendance?
2667280	2670520	Stan Manstein is not in attendance currently.
2670520	2675440	So I say to Rosemary, looks like our new boy didn't get his job done.
2675440	2678520	I'm going to circle the perimeter and check things out.
2678520	2683940	And I want to make my way towards the so-called Clark Bishop in this old uniform.
2683940	2685600	Does he look natural?
2685600	2687800	Is his stance Clark's stance?
2687800	2689440	Yeah, absolutely.
2689440	2690440	It looks like Clark.
2690440	2691440	Do I still have?
2691440	2693440	No, John died in his underwear.
2693440	2695920	He didn't have a cell phone.
2695920	2699560	John died in his underwear.
2699560	2701720	Shot by his daddy.
2701720	2703240	Where do you want to set up?
2703240	2708200	Rosemary is like, I think I'm going to get some higher ground over here.
2708200	2711560	She is going to climb on top of one of the mausoleums.
2711560	2715280	And she's like, I'm just going to lay flat and watch.
2715280	2716900	That looks real dumb.
2716900	2724480	You look very conspicuous, but I've learned to trust your methods in our many years together.
2724480	2725480	Nailed it.
2725480	2726480	Convincing.
2726480	2731360	So yeah, I want to walk behind or just walk near and around that Clark Bishop.
2731360	2736880	I want to be kind of unseen and I want to cough bubblegum tree in the middle of a crowd
2736880	2737880	and see if he looks.
2737880	2738880	Okay.
2738880	2741480	Go ahead and roll stealth for me.
2741480	2743480	Yeah.
2743480	2745580	81.
2745580	2746580	My skill is 50.
2746580	2747580	Okay.
2747580	2748580	Yeah.
2748580	2749580	We don't even need a mirror.
2749580	2752880	I want to get behind just some people near him and kind of like play in the penis game
2752880	2754760	just like bubblegum tree, bubblegum tree.
2754760	2755760	Okay.
2755760	2756760	Yeah.
2756760	2757760	That's great.
2757760	2758760	Does he look?
2759160	2762000	I I'm should I go ask him?
2762000	2763000	Maybe.
2763000	2764000	Yeah.
2764000	2765000	All right.
2765000	2766000	I'll be right back.
2766000	2767000	Okay.
2777000	2778000	All right, Joe.
2778000	2779000	Hey there.
2779000	2788000	Clark Bishop is leaning up against this mausoleum and from behind him, he hears bubblegum tree.
2788240	2789880	I whip around.
2789880	2795440	When you turn around, there's a crowd around standing around before the funeral service
2795440	2797080	actually begins.
2797080	2802360	And there are people both like in front of and to the side and behind you through the
2802360	2805040	small crowd behind you.
2805040	2809240	You notice a face that you recognize.
2809240	2816520	It's the face that you saw standing at the bar when you're in the cages hanging in that
2816520	2822160	God forsaken room in Marvin Glass's place.
2822160	2828480	It is Kevin, the security guy, the one who was kind of unaffected by the scene.
2828480	2829480	Yes.
2829480	2830480	Gotcha.
2830480	2831480	I see him.
