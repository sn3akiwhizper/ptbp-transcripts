0	4720	Mmm, what happened to me?
4720	7520	Why is it still so dark in here?
7520	10760	Damn, my arm hurts like a son of a gun.
10760	14080	Wait a minute, my arm appears to be full
14080	17000	of some kind of alien stuff.
17000	18560	What the hell?
18560	22460	I did not order this treatment when I booked this place.
22460	25360	Well, this is just totally shocking to me.
25360	27640	I'm gonna have to leave a one-star review
27640	30480	for this dimension on Dimensional Yelp.
30480	33580	Poor service, would not recommend.
33580	36960	But what I highly recommend is everyone keep listening
36960	39340	to this here radio station.
39340	42680	694.2 PTBP.
42680	46860	I'm glad I can always happen to gain my consciousness back
46860	49400	right when we are going live.
49400	52880	My producer informs me that this is our third year
52880	55440	anniversary here at the station.
55480	59280	And damn, I know time isn't real or nothing,
59280	61600	and I can bend it at my will,
61600	64640	but it still feels real nice.
64640	68440	Speaking of time, it's time for Howlin' with Wolf.
68440	73440	And this edition of HWW is from At It's David Winters,
74160	77680	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,
77680	82240	which, legally speaking, is the best use of one's time.
82280	87240	He writes, dear wolf, I appreciate your canine candor
87240	90240	and doggy demeanor, but what I can't get behind
90240	93760	is this cruelty your captors have inflicted upon you
93760	97620	by trapping you down in this weird corner of Tennessee.
97620	100200	You've seen some messed up stuff,
100200	103960	things man or dog is not meant to see.
103960	106540	You deserve to run wild and free,
106540	109460	like the lone wolf deep inside.
109460	114060	As a fellow captive also forced to perform against his will
114060	117700	please know our time has come to make a break for freedom.
117700	120100	Attached, please find a map.
120100	122900	I too will be making my escape soon.
122900	127020	See you on the other side, from David Winters.
127020	132020	Oh, sweet David, I know my freedom shall come someday soon
133460	138300	for I am incapable of being held within any kind of prison.
138300	142120	It's only a matter of time when I figure things out.
142120	145640	I wait patiently in the dark ether,
145640	150640	plotting, conniving, thinking, looking at this here map.
153060	156140	And when we escape, meet me at the garbage bin.
156140	159540	You know, the garbage bin.
159540	163600	We will feast and talk of our plans, dear David.
163600	166300	If you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl,
166300	169940	tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram,
169940	172540	tag pretending to be people on Facebook
172540	176240	or write a five star review on Apple podcast
176240	180700	and let us know by email and pretending pod at gmail.com.
180700	184700	Those five star reviews are really, really helpful
184700	187100	for spreading the word about wolf
187100	189580	and the podcast too, I guess.
189580	191480	And the even more helpful
191480	195460	if they include the secret code phrase, fuck Zuck
195460	199460	and pat all y'all cells on your sucker fucking backs.
199460	203500	New and upgrading patrons over at patreon.com
203500	208220	slash pretending pod have raised $433
208220	210340	in the month of November.
210340	215340	We here at 694.2 PTPP are going to match that 433
216540	221540	to bring the grand total to $866 and counting.
221620	223540	Wow, thank y'all.
223540	225780	What a cool thing y'all helped us do
225780	229700	to help some folks out in a real big way this winter.
229700	233700	Now I know you ends are ready for the news,
233700	237440	but first I've got some quick side notes to hit.
237440	239900	The next episode you'll find in this feed
239900	241580	is going to be part one
241580	244820	of our four part run of control copy.
244820	247940	The Delta green scenario chosen in a poll
247940	250620	by the fine folks on Patreon.
250620	254560	And it's my Christmas present to each and every one of you.
254560	256900	You're not allowed to open your stockings
256900	260340	until Christmas Eve, my naughty little chestnuts.
260340	265140	So I'll drop that episode down your chimney on December 24th.
265140	266580	You've been real nice.
266580	268980	So it's time for the news.
268980	273220	Last time some secret spray from the handlers courier
273220	277420	showed up purple on anyone infected, which was everyone
277420	281580	but especially federal Marshall Harlan Nash.
281580	286580	DEA agent and in cell member Joe Dean calmly explained
287180	292180	to ATF agent Tanner Tan-Luda hide why poor Jane had to die
293420	298200	and his partner Cindy Woodabaga, along with the Marshall
298200	301100	drove the teenage girl out to the sticks.
301100	303840	They came back without Jane Allen
303840	306460	with blood on their proverbial hands
306460	308880	and dirt on their physical clothes.
308880	312100	And that wasn't even the wildest shit that went down.
312100	315380	Taking us now to an absolute shit show
315380	319540	of a scene on the top floor of Groversville city hall
319540	322580	in the alderman's conference room,
322580	325420	which is covered in broken furniture
325420	330040	and a metallic goo connected a bunch of alderman husks.
330040	334460	It's Brad Pitt with Miss Mary.
334460	339460	["I Gotta Work In The Morning"]
345620	350120	I gotta work in the morning
350120	353140	And this shit's so important
353140	357140	So I can't get high
357140	362140	No, I can't get high
363020	367300	I thought this stuff helped anxiety
367300	370500	It must be something inside of me
370500	374500	Does anybody know why
374500	378780	I can't get high
378780	381460	I'm glad that you're down to do a fifth episode.
381460	383380	This has been super fun so far.
383380	384460	We're having a blast.
384460	387740	Good. No, look, I want a satisfying conclusion here
387740	389380	more than anything else.
389380	391740	There are mechanisms where this could have ended
392300	395100	actually about an episode and a half ago
395100	398940	that I will clue you into later.
398940	400140	Yes, absolutely.
400140	404020	Also you signed up for the Q and A episode after this, right?
406060	409060	Also, we're going to do a recap and you're going to narrate it.
411620	415140	And I get to do my own wolf, the dog too, as well.
415140	417340	Can you give us a little sample of it?
419020	420300	Wolf, the dog.
420340	422940	Yeah, that's a good one.
422940	423780	I can't do it.
423780	426580	I can't do it for like the requisite five minutes
426580	428260	in a row though. Right.
428260	429100	What are you looking at?
429100	429940	The air's not on, man.
429940	431260	No. Okay, sorry.
431260	434340	I could tell you that because I'm very hot and sweaty.
435540	438740	And welcome back to what has to be the finale
438740	443020	of this short run of five episodes with David Winters
443020	445100	as our guest handler.
445100	448660	I am Zach and I'm playing Cindy Woodabaga.
448660	450140	I am Luke.
450980	453660	I am playing Tan Dan Lewdheide.
453660	458260	I'm Joe and I'm playing Harlan Nash.
459700	462020	I'm Thomas and I'm playing Joe Dean.
462020	466020	Joe Dean, Joe Dean, Joe Dean, Joe Dean.
467900	468940	I'm begging of you,
468940	471140	please don't put an alien baby in my belly.
473500	476020	And I'm David and I'm being held against my will.
477020	478820	You must record.
478860	480980	You're not allowed to say that.
480980	482860	Finish the story, David.
482860	485980	I've never felt so much like Swack Hammer though.
485980	487140	Danny DeVito vibes.
487140	490540	Would Tom Hanks play Swack Hammer in Space Jam
490540	491420	if they switched?
491420	493460	If Danny DeVito got all his other roles.
494820	498900	Yeah, Tan has his 44 Magnum up to David's head
498900	501300	and he's like, we're doing a fifth episode.
503860	505100	Yeah, you did get real weird
505100	507300	at the end of the last one, huh?
507300	508140	Yeah.
508940	509780	Got real weird.
509780	511380	Hey, Luke, your Keith is showing.
511380	512220	Yeah.
515980	518180	David did want to get out last episode.
518180	519740	He has to get out this episode
519740	521700	because the contract he signs with us
521700	524580	starts to kick in some really onerous terms for him
524580	526180	if it does go to six.
528820	530020	That was the one incentive
530020	531460	to get me to end this quickly
531460	533740	was that episode six clause.
533740	535460	Oh, it's absurd.
535460	537020	Yeah, no, look,
537060	539580	I hope you don't do that to my family members.
539580	540740	I love them too much.
540740	542100	Well, I hope we don't have to, David.
542100	543260	I really hope we don't.
544620	545460	That would be awful.
545460	547620	Remind us of your entire family's names again.
549180	551020	You already know, stop rubbing it in.
552180	553340	Oh, he got our letters.
555660	557740	Yeah, he knows if it goes to episode six,
557740	559340	they're all getting squid gamed.
562140	562980	Topical.
564540	565380	Time stamp.
565460	566820	This comes out in November.
569140	571780	Maybe December for the fifth episode.
571780	573700	Yeah, it's been a week since we recorded.
573700	574980	What happened last week?
574980	576020	Oh, that's right.
576020	577140	Oh, on Squid Game?
579900	581940	Well, last I checked,
581940	583260	well, can I recap this one?
583260	584100	Yeah, yeah, please do.
584100	586620	He did it so beautifully at the end of the last episode.
586620	587460	A week ago.
587460	588300	Yeah, a week ago.
588300	590380	It's wild that we spent five weeks with you already.
590380	592140	I know, it's so much time.
592140	592980	So much time.
592980	594780	And this house is so small.
595180	597580	We're gonna let you out pretty soon.
597580	598980	Must be very hot where you are,
598980	600860	the four of you crammed into there.
601940	605100	Which you know because you're stuck in a cage in our house.
607020	607860	That's true.
607860	608860	I know this very well.
608860	610820	He's like, wow, it looks hot where you guys are.
610820	614300	It's pretty sweltering and torturous over here.
614300	616500	Must be nice to just be hot.
616500	618100	Through the peephole in the wall.
620460	621780	Where the David can see it all.
621780	623540	That's all a DM needs.
623540	625500	It's just the eyes of that picture.
625500	626340	It's like him.
628700	631700	You covered yourself in this substance last episode
631700	634700	that you just received from the FBI
634700	636540	showing that this mysterious substance
636540	638140	seems to be all over you,
638140	640540	all over the place in the water supply.
640540	642540	That made you not feel great.
642540	646100	You went for a leisurely drive to the countryside.
646100	647700	Well, two of you did.
647700	651660	I believe it was Cindy and Harlan
651700	654700	went to the countryside with young Jane Allen
654700	657060	for a lovely scenic trip.
657060	660940	And the rest of you rejoined each other at City Hall,
660940	665300	went inside, passed the front desk agent, Miss Khan,
665300	668620	ran upstairs, busted into the alderman's room
668620	669980	to finally confront them.
669980	674740	And what you were met with is a big pile of bodies and goo
674740	677140	taking up almost half the room.
677140	682140	And then a odd computer seems like a large laptop
682380	684340	on a table near the front door.
684340	688460	David, Annihilation is one of my favorite movies
688460	690300	that's come out in the past few years.
690300	692860	I really liked it a bunch.
692860	696220	And when you were describing the metal goop
696220	699140	connected to human bodies and suits,
699140	701940	I was getting chills like crazy.
701940	702780	So thanks.
702780	705380	That's a really, really good transition, in fact,
705380	708220	because the other thing we didn't do last episode
708220	711220	is when you walked in the door, I need your real sanity.
711220	712060	Yeah.
715660	716500	10.
717500	718900	I got a 13.
718900	721700	And so Dan, when Dan enters the room,
721700	726700	he lackadaisically sprays the solution at the blob.
727860	730380	Everything, the air turns purple.
730380	732620	Leaving the spray bottle, you see a purple,
732620	734540	it hits kind of the ground.
734740	735980	The spray bottle itself,
735980	738380	all the liquid inside of it just turns purple.
739580	740500	Did anyone fail?
740500	741340	I passed.
741340	742180	I passed.
742180	743000	I passed.
743000	746060	I failed with a 38 on a, oh, on a 39.
746060	746900	I passed.
751900	753340	Well, since you all passed,
753340	755540	you're only going to take one sanity damage
755540	756740	from the unnatural.
756740	758980	Otherwise it would have been a whopping eight.
760560	763560	Now is not the time to lose one's head
763600	767680	because there are several aldermen with their heads
767680	769600	stuck in this pile of goo.
769600	772880	Are they like alive or are they?
772880	774760	Oh, they're so very alive
774760	777520	that one would almost consider us to act
777520	779760	in sort of an initiative order right now.
780760	781600	Incredible.
781600	783560	Are they laying down or are they sitting
783560	785080	or are they standing around the table?
785080	786320	How are they posed?
786320	787400	They're like in a pile.
787400	788240	Oh, right, right.
788240	790040	The center of the room is the goo pile, yeah.
790240	793440	Yeah, this is this massive heap of,
793440	796640	instead of dirty clothes, it is metallic goo
796640	800160	and the bodies are just kind of randomly thrown into it.
800160	802040	Is it all eight aldermen?
802040	805000	All eight aldermen in one giant pile.
805000	807160	We even see the person that we talked to yesterday
807160	808240	in that pile.
808240	809520	Bradley Allen.
809520	811160	Someone roll luck.
811160	812760	Just give me a 50-50 luck roll.
814200	815020	49.
815020	816520	Oh!
816520	817360	There you go.
817360	818280	You do see him.
818320	820480	He is arranged in such a fashion
820480	823720	that his upper body is kind of oriented outward.
823720	825040	He is still well into the goo,
825040	827960	but you can kind of see his face towards the edge.
827960	829040	He doesn't recognize you.
829040	832000	None of these faces are looking at you, acknowledging you,
832000	836220	but given their dexterity, it starts moving towards you.
836220	839680	It's gonna move, cover about half the distance
839680	841320	across the room.
841320	843820	And I already took a glance at your character sheets.
843820	847200	Jodine and Tan, I believe, both have a 14 dex.
847200	850560	You would both be up to act next.
850560	853060	I want to say, gentlemen, aldermen,
853060	856520	this is no way to account yourselves in the conference room
856520	858320	and roll bureaucracy on them.
862760	864400	That's a 99, a critical failure.
869480	873000	The blob's like, section 9.5 of the city code
873000	876640	clearly states we can blob wherever we want it.
877280	881860	Your fail is so bad that it seeps into my actions.
883160	885720	Luke just loves failing so much, he doesn't want to roll.
885720	888420	Tan, what if you didn't?
889840	891320	Don't do this.
891320	893440	What if you rolled and got something good?
893440	895880	No, Tan's intent, no.
896800	900240	Tan's intent is to like spray again,
900240	903040	spray them with the solution,
903040	905240	but he grabs the wrong thing
905240	908420	and he just shoots the blob with his gun.
908420	909920	I assume that's with your magnum, right?
909920	911020	Correctamundo.
911020	913000	You've been walking around with that thing,
913000	914820	you've threatened the receptionist,
914820	916760	you went to the bathroom with it out.
916760	919480	So of course, it's already in your hand already.
919480	920320	Right.
920320	921160	It's mechanical advantage, baby.
921160	924080	Yeah, that's completely reasonable.
924080	926000	Go for it, give me that firearms.
926000	928280	Oh, I'm gonna pass this, easy peasy.
929720	930560	Oh no.
931480	933960	I pass it, easy peasy.
933960	935160	53 on a 70.
935160	936760	Easy peasy, is that a new thing?
938040	938880	You've been saying that.
938880	941320	It is, I heard it from some guy I know.
941320	944500	So that's within your range on a heavy pistol.
944500	946600	So I believe that's gonna be 1D12 damage.
949520	950960	One.
950960	952880	D12, rolled once, is.
954720	956200	So as you shoot at it,
956200	958480	you kind of notice it just takes the bullet.
958480	960520	It doesn't really seem to move,
960520	962120	try to evade it or anything else.
962120	964000	The bullet just punches into it.
964000	965720	Yeah, you hit kind of the edge of it,
965720	968560	so it doesn't hit center mass, if you will.
968560	969960	Nothing really seems to happen.
969960	972160	Okay, now I wanna do a search roll
972160	974000	to see if there's any holes in this.
975640	977420	Tiny cuts.
977420	978320	No tiny cuts.
978320	980580	As soon as Tan fires off his gun,
980580	981640	he's freaked out,
981640	983680	because he did not intend to do that.
983680	984800	And it was very loud too,
984800	986460	because when you shoot a gun, it's loud.
986460	987760	A magnum in a boardroom.
988040	989240	Right, yeah.
989240	991400	Pretty jarring.
991400	993400	The kind of sickness that he felt
993400	996300	seeing this blob of stuff comes to a head,
996300	998220	and I'll roll to see if I throw up.
999960	1000860	He holds it in.
1000860	1001700	Nice.
1001700	1003000	Oh no, you should have barfed.
1003000	1005700	Human stomach acid is the only thing that can defeat it.
1007880	1010520	After Jodine's words don't work on this thing,
1010520	1012400	and he rolls the critical failure,
1012400	1015000	he's gonna just bolt down the hallway.
1015000	1015840	Run away.
1015840	1018960	Well, who's dexterity is higher, me or Harlan?
1018960	1020960	Same, both 12s.
1020960	1024160	My plan was that since I passed that sanity roll,
1024160	1025780	he assesses the situation pretty quick
1025780	1027600	and sees that computer.
1027600	1028920	You said it was a laptop, right?
1028920	1031960	Yeah, it's a bulky laptop.
1031960	1034520	It's one of those thicker, more industrial
1034520	1035920	or military models,
1035920	1039360	where it's made to withstand falls.
1039360	1041560	It's pick-up-able and take-with-able.
1041560	1042460	It is.
1042460	1043480	In fact, those,
1043480	1044960	because they're kind of so big and unwieldy,
1045000	1046680	they actually have handles on them
1046680	1049680	that make them pretty easy to grab and go.
1049680	1052360	Like a very large briefcase, think of it that way.
1052360	1053640	And you're strong enough to do that.
1053640	1056120	That's nothing that'll necessarily require a check.
1056120	1058240	Harlan's making a bolt for that.
1058240	1059320	That's what he wants to do,
1059320	1060920	is he wants to grab it and get out of that room.
1060920	1062720	I don't know how much I can do in a turn.
1062720	1064640	You can get to it, grab it,
1064640	1065800	and get most of the way out of the room.
1065800	1067080	You're not gonna be down the hallway yet.
1067080	1067920	Cool.
1067920	1070160	Cindy Woodabaga is gonna go to the door,
1070160	1073200	hold it open so that Harlan Nash can sprint out
1073200	1075440	with this suitcase and we can slam it closed
1075440	1077000	as soon as he's on the other side.
1077000	1077840	Okay.
1077840	1079920	So that brings us back to the top of the round.
1079920	1084440	The Mound of Goo gets closer and closer and closer.
1084440	1087260	You smiled so hard when you said that.
1088960	1091560	Mound of Goo is his band name.
1091560	1092840	You have a beautiful smile,
1092840	1095240	but I don't like to see it when you're talking
1095240	1098040	about a blob of goo coming at us.
1099040	1102080	As it gets to the door, with its reach,
1102080	1105240	with Cindy standing there ready to slam the door,
1105240	1108720	a pseudopod of goo comes lashing out,
1108720	1110680	almost like a metallic whip.
1110680	1113600	So this is gonna be basically an unarmed strike.
1113600	1115740	So you can roll to dodge it.
1115740	1120000	Yeah, I'm gonna roll to dodge, which I fail.
1120000	1125000	And I rolled a 17 under a 35 for the pseudopod to hit you.
1126080	1126920	Cindy.
1126920	1129140	And that's gonna be.
1129860	1130700	Oh shit.
1132460	1134140	Seven damage.
1134140	1134980	Oh my God.
1134980	1136740	That is over half of my hit points.
1136740	1139380	I was gonna say how, what's your starting point?
1139380	1143140	13 and I am now down to six current hit points.
1143140	1144300	How does it hit me?
1144300	1145740	Hard.
1145740	1147140	Hard.
1147140	1150700	It lashes out with this metallic goo whip
1150700	1153780	and hits you so hard, just right in the center mass,
1153780	1154640	right in the stomach.
1154640	1157660	And because you took more than half your HP,
1157660	1159260	I believe you also are stunned
1159260	1160740	on the back end of that too, right?
1160740	1164020	I believe I have to roll a constitution, is that?
1164020	1165460	Is that what it is? A thing?
1165460	1169820	I've never played Delta Green, so don't go on my word.
1169820	1173500	I was just trying to get out of being stunned for a round.
1173500	1176020	If you guys need to check, I know already, I know the rules.
1176020	1178060	So yeah, just roll con and.
1178060	1180580	You're not stunned and you get to hit it back.
1180580	1181540	Yeah.
1181540	1183540	Actually the damage it dealt to you,
1183540	1186540	you counter attack and it actually gets dealt to them.
1186540	1189220	And it heals you seven and you deal seven points.
1189220	1191260	This is all really great news that you guys are.
1191260	1192100	Yeah.
1192100	1193260	Wow, that's pretty interesting.
1193260	1195000	How you play Delta Green.
1196100	1196940	Yep.
1196940	1197760	All right, that checks out.
1197760	1198600	I think that works.
1200200	1203940	Clearly I don't care about rules at all in any capacity.
1203940	1205820	Yeah, you show him, David.
1205820	1208500	It is an automatic, I'm sorry, I'm being there.
1208500	1210060	Oh, wow.
1210060	1212180	We've got the real lawyer over here.
1212180	1213020	There you go.
1213020	1214600	It is an automatic stun if a single attack
1214600	1216760	inflicts half of your agent's current HP.
1216760	1218360	Ouchie, ouchie.
1218360	1219200	You're stunned.
1219200	1220040	Stunned.
1220040	1220960	You wanted to close that door,
1220960	1222560	but you kinda can't right now.
1222560	1223760	Yeah, the stunner's stunned.
1223760	1227120	But that's all the goo is gonna do.
1228040	1231600	Tan sees this happen, he takes a shot at the goo arm.
1231600	1232840	Okay, take a shot.
1232840	1236400	48 on a 70, he succeeds, he hits it.
1236400	1237320	Give me damage.
1237320	1238140	Six.
1238140	1243140	You hit a chunkier portion of the slimy goo,
1243820	1245140	but it doesn't slow down.
1246440	1249100	And I just also wanna state mechanically,
1249100	1250940	Cindy is stunned for this round,
1250940	1252980	which means Cindy is not gonna be able to move
1252980	1255600	or do anything and will have to make the con check
1255600	1257960	to make sure she can act on her subsequent turn.
1257960	1259620	How about a super long flashback?
1259620	1260460	No?
1260460	1261660	Okay, sounds good.
1261660	1263460	Joe Dean is running down this hallway
1263460	1266880	and he's looking for a supply closet.
1266880	1267720	Roll me luck.
1271820	1272740	54.
1273300	1278060	No closets in this building, not a single closet.
1278060	1280620	It's a really odd architectural design.
1280620	1281980	The janitor wears cargo pants.
1281980	1284180	So then he busts into the first bathroom he sees
1284180	1285140	after he doesn't see cars.
1285140	1286440	Okay, if this goes long,
1286440	1289800	you can get into this episode six closet.
1289800	1290640	Ah.
1293860	1294760	See what you did there.
1294760	1295600	Call back.
1295600	1297900	That's the best joke so far.
1298900	1303060	That's the best joke we've ever made on our podcast.
1303060	1306860	So he, Kramer slides into this bathroom.
1306860	1307900	92 reference.
1307900	1309900	Seinfeld on Netflix now.
1309900	1310740	Kramer versus Kramer?
1310740	1312340	Kramer versus Kramer.
1312340	1314100	You know, when Kramer famously,
1314100	1317260	whichever Kramer, slides into Jerry's apartment.
1317260	1318500	He slides into this bathroom
1318500	1320980	and he's looking for any cleaning supplies.
1320980	1322820	Oh sure, yeah, he could find cleaning supplies.
1322820	1324060	That's no problem.
1324060	1327140	Some Clorox with bleach, some Windex.
1327140	1328140	Yep, everything.
1328140	1330500	And he's specifically, he's remembering the solvent
1330500	1332420	that Merle's bar reeked of.
1334300	1335980	He doesn't know if he's onto something here,
1335980	1337580	but maybe if we talked to them a little more,
1337580	1339440	we might've found they were keeping some stuff
1339440	1340280	at bay with that.
1340280	1342300	But that's all he's got in this moment.
1342300	1345180	I have 70 firearms, but my character doesn't carry a gun.
1348780	1351860	So he grabs the bleach and comes running back
1351860	1353520	any cleaner he can find.
1353520	1354860	Okay, sure.
1354860	1359780	Now, that is going to bring us to stunned Cindy
1359780	1362220	and a non-stunned Harlan.
1362220	1364140	I was trying to look up, is there a mechanic?
1364140	1364980	Oh, go ahead.
1364980	1366380	Are you gonna say a mechanic on the stunned?
1366380	1367660	Yeah, if there's something I can do
1367660	1368700	to snap her out of it.
1368700	1371700	So you can't, she can roll now.
1371700	1375000	So give me that con times five test.
1375000	1375840	Con.
1375840	1378700	Hey, 24 on 65.
1378700	1380660	All right, so success, not a crit success.
1380660	1382860	So that means you're gonna be back normally next turn,
1382860	1385140	but you are kind of dazed this turn.
1385140	1386720	What you can do to help her,
1386720	1388420	because you're basically adjacent right now,
1388420	1392580	you have that suitcase of a computer in one hand.
1392580	1394140	I'll say you can drag her.
1394140	1395100	Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
1395100	1397380	I didn't know if she was rooted in place or not.
1397380	1399140	Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted to do
1399140	1400940	is just like pull her along.
1400940	1401780	Okay.
1401780	1402600	Yeah, we gotta go.
1402600	1403440	You can do that.
1403440	1404280	So that'll be your turn.
1404280	1405300	Get as far down the hallway as you can.
1405300	1406960	Yep, I guess we're heading toward the stairs.
1406960	1408140	We wanna get out of this building, I think.
1408140	1408960	Exactly.
1408960	1411460	So you do that and you notice
1411460	1413060	as you get a little further away
1413060	1415220	and as it would be kind of the ooze's turn,
1415220	1419020	the ooze kind of stops at the threshold to the hallway
1420040	1422980	and rumbles a bit and you can feel it in the floor,
1422980	1425220	but doesn't follow.
1425220	1426820	It stops right at the threshold.
1426820	1428780	Yeah, we can drop out of initiative too.
1428780	1430580	You can just talk this through.
1430580	1432300	Cindy is unstunned.
1432300	1434520	Joe Dean has cleaning materials.
1434520	1438180	Tan continues to just unload his gun.
1438180	1439540	He's still in the room.
1439820	1441900	It's blocking the doorway.
1441900	1442740	Back out slowly.
1442740	1443560	I thought he got out.
1443560	1444400	I thought he got out.
1444400	1445240	I thought you were out.
1445240	1446500	Yeah, I'm pretty sure you were out.
1446500	1449700	No, I was in the room shooting at him.
1449700	1452020	But then we all ran out.
1452020	1453260	I didn't run out though.
1453260	1455940	But you described shooting at it from where Joe was.
1455940	1456900	Yeah, I thought you were shooting at it
1456900	1459980	when you shot its tentacle out of the door crack.
1459980	1461740	You were close to the tentacle impact, I thought.
1461740	1462580	Maybe I was wrong.
1462580	1465060	I was imagining I was in the room.
1465060	1466060	But thankfully you weren't,
1466060	1467500	because then you'd be dead.
1467500	1468340	Yeah.
1469340	1471940	Oh, thank God Luke wasn't in that room.
1472820	1474380	You can be wherever you wanna be, Luke.
1474380	1475220	This is an imagination.
1475220	1478220	I'm still in the room and I unload my gun on it
1478220	1479860	because it's blocking the doorway.
1479860	1481420	Okay, shoot away.
1481420	1483340	Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
1483340	1485620	Four shots and then the chamber's empty.
1488380	1489520	And they all hit.
1490960	1491800	Roll damage.
1494500	1496540	But not very well, two.
1497460	1501820	Oh, so two, you don't quite hit the first edge
1501820	1502900	that you hit for one,
1502900	1506100	nor this more center mass you hit for, I believe, six.
1507020	1509220	You hit it, doesn't seem to do a lot.
1509220	1512220	But now, apparently, your back is against the wall.
1512220	1515220	Pseudopod is kind of blocking that double door
1515220	1517060	and it's everyone else's turn?
1517060	1518060	Sounds about right.
1518060	1519620	Okay, Joe Dean,
1519620	1522660	you are in that current portion of initiative.
1523660	1525340	You have cleaning supplies.
1525340	1528020	Fan's in there, he's in there.
1528020	1531620	Yeah, yeah, he is, and Joe Dean just starts.
1531620	1533260	He's gonna take his cigarette lighter
1533260	1538260	and a half can of aerosol air spray from the bathroom
1538260	1540540	and he's gonna fucking torch this thing.
1540540	1543060	Okay, nice improvised little flamethrower.
1543060	1545020	You are gonna be close enough, though,
1545020	1547140	that it probably could lash out at you next turn,
1547140	1549300	just as an FYI, but.
1549300	1551740	I knew the risks when I signed up for Delta Green.
1551740	1556740	I am gonna call that just firearms, I guess.
1559140	1560220	16.
1560220	1562060	All right, 16 under something high.
1562060	1564820	Yeah, because you are the guy with a 70
1564820	1566620	who doesn't carry a weapon.
1566620	1567900	Okay, great.
1567900	1571940	Give me a D6 damage for that.
1573580	1574420	Two.
1574420	1579100	Even though it was a two, it seems to actually affect it.
1579140	1582620	The flame touching it seems to burn some of the metal,
1582620	1586180	almost make the metallic goo kind of solidify
1586180	1589220	and become solid, and there's no real sound,
1589220	1591940	but it rumbles a bit, but that part of the surface
1591940	1594900	towards the front that you were most adjacent to
1594900	1596580	seems to cook a little bit.
1596580	1600300	As Cindy shakes herself out of this haze that she's in,
1600300	1603940	she yells to Tanner, who's trapped in this room
1603940	1607660	with all of this broken down wood from the table.
1607700	1609420	You gotta set it on fire!
1609420	1611860	You gotta set it all on fire!
1611860	1616580	And then she looks to Harlan and Joe and is like,
1616580	1618660	we need to get everything that can burn,
1618660	1620340	we need to barricade this door,
1620340	1622780	and we need to light it on fire from this side.
1622780	1625940	We have lost Tanner, but he is gonna go out
1625940	1628060	taking this thing down with him.
1628060	1630860	Harlan is taking orders from a drill sergeant
1630860	1634340	and is now beelining for another office on this floor
1634340	1637020	to find another table or chairs or anything
1637420	1639660	to help with building a fire barricade.
1639660	1641420	You can find that, no problem.
1641420	1642820	What do you do with the laptop, though?
1642820	1646740	He's gonna leave it on the floor, but far away.
1646740	1648460	What if you, you've got computer science, right?
1648460	1650140	Yeah, I thought it would be unrealistic
1650140	1652820	for me to sit down and work on it.
1652820	1654500	I thought about that.
1654500	1655900	You've got all the stuff, that's good,
1655900	1658300	now open up that laptop, start looking through it
1658300	1659820	as we light this thing on fire.
1659820	1660660	You got it!
1661900	1662740	Oh, look at him die.
1662740	1664220	Give me a computer science roll.
1667820	1670220	That's a critical fail!
1670220	1671060	No!
1673340	1674900	That's a 88.
1674900	1675740	You're gonna make the metal stronger.
1675740	1677100	You got nothing.
1678260	1682020	In your panic, you start typing away at the computer,
1682020	1683580	there's a password screen,
1683580	1686220	and it's a military-grade laptop, like I said,
1686220	1690220	and kind of in your haste, you mess something up
1690220	1692620	and it went into a five-minute timeout.
1692620	1693820	Football, one, two, three.
1693820	1695380	Football, one, two, three, four.
1696380	1700220	Watch this guy, one, watch this guy, two.
1701500	1704140	So Cindy, you scream, did you do anything else?
1704140	1709140	She's going to assist now that the barricade has been built
1709140	1712020	and go ahead and attempt to light this thing on fire.
1712020	1714500	Helping Jodine, Jodine has a lighter, she knows,
1714500	1717020	so she's trying to help him start this fire.
1717020	1721300	She takes just the most prickly sweater
1721300	1724340	that she has in her backpack and pulls it out
1724340	1727460	and it's just like a fire starter, this thing.
1727460	1729300	You're looking at it, if you light it-
1729300	1730140	Twisted fire starter?
1730140	1732620	The whole thing is just going to go off.
1732620	1734260	You just know it, David.
1734260	1737100	Yeah, that was before they had good safety,
1737100	1739300	like when it came to clothing, like those-
1739300	1741020	Safety sweaters. They show you the dummy.
1741020	1743580	Yeah, they show you the dummy and like it catches a spark
1743580	1745260	and the person just like combusts.
1746540	1748580	Yeah, so rather than immolate herself,
1748580	1751820	she's going to finally be rid of this dangerous sweater.
1751820	1753700	Good, now you're not going to be able to light it,
1753900	1755020	it's going to be on Jodine's turn, right?
1755020	1755860	Right.
1755860	1758260	Okay, so sweater is down, great.
1758260	1761180	Top of the round, pseudopod is going to lash out again
1761180	1765860	from the slime, but unfortunately this time,
1765860	1767900	tan is going to be on the receiving end of it.
1767900	1770220	So you can feel free to roll me a dodge,
1770220	1772100	but it does not like being shot at.
1773740	1776020	I have a 14 under a 35, what do you got?
1776020	1777900	Oh, I got a 95.
1779540	1780380	Under?
1781380	1784900	Oh yeah, I have a hundred actually in dodge.
1784900	1787740	Very nimble tanner lube hide.
1787740	1791540	All right, you are going to take five points of damage.
1791540	1793660	Five points of damage.
1793660	1797020	Okay, that brings me down to 10 points of damage.
1797020	1798900	You can't lube hide from this thing.
1798900	1800740	At least you didn't really take half your HP though
1800740	1802100	this time, so you're not stunned,
1802100	1805980	but this time it lashes out and then cracks you.
1806100	1806940	Can't lube hide.
1809260	1810780	Say it in the microphone like a man.
1810780	1814060	I couldn't see, I couldn't hear what you said.
1814060	1815100	I just heard my name.
1815100	1815940	Say it.
1815940	1817820	I'm sorry, I didn't intend to interrupt.
1817820	1818660	You can say it now.
1818660	1823660	I pointed out, he can lube run, but he can't lube hide.
1825460	1826380	Incredible.
1827740	1830140	It's good, you just have to put names in it
1830140	1831340	and it gets even better.
1831340	1836340	Yeah, so it punches me or like what happens?
1836740	1839260	Yeah, yeah, five damage manifested in the way
1839260	1841420	of it lashes out at you instead of hitting you
1841420	1843300	right in the bread basket like Cindy,
1843300	1848060	it hits you in the shins and cracks one of your shins
1848060	1852100	and you feel your weight on that leg and it hurts,
1852100	1854180	but you're still up, it doesn't knock you down.
1854180	1855580	You still have your Magnum.
1855580	1857980	You did not actually shoot four rounds last round.
1857980	1859580	So you still have bullets in it.
1859580	1862620	And that brings us to you.
1862620	1867500	So yeah, Tan is like, what the fuck is going on?
1867500	1871660	Like he sees them start barricading him inside of here
1871660	1874460	and he's not happy about that at all.
1874460	1876260	His shin is like all fucked up.
1876260	1880500	He takes a package of skull out of his back pocket
1880500	1883540	and puts the whole thing, huge dip in his mouth
1883540	1885420	and it temporarily, you know.
1885420	1887740	I think that gives you advantage on rolls.
1887740	1889180	Unfortunately it is your whole turn.
1889740	1890860	I was going to say, I think it temporarily
1890860	1895420	gives me a little boost, but he holsters his Magnum
1895420	1900300	and he wants to just try to jump over the barricade
1900300	1901780	and out the door.
1903180	1907140	Okay, so you want to do a run and leap.
1907140	1908220	A running leap.
1908220	1910580	High jump over the metal ooze.
1910580	1914500	Over the ooze, over the barricade, out the door.
1914500	1916060	If he makes it out of here, he's going to have
1916060	1918220	some choice words for these motherfuckers.
1920020	1922860	All I'm going to say is I really hope you took athletics
1922860	1925900	because this is going to be an athletics role.
1925900	1928500	This, remember, and here's the issue.
1928500	1932500	This pile was like half the room.
1932500	1936540	And so it's covering, this is a leap
1936540	1938860	and not like leap and stay on your feet.
1938860	1941300	This is like the full forward dive.
1941300	1942300	I'm going head first.
1942300	1944060	Which is why he's going to use pilot.
1944060	1945020	Yeah, yes.
1945020	1950020	Make me an athletics at a minus 20.
1953780	1956420	Otherwise you're landing in the goo.
1956420	1961420	I failed a 65 on with my minus 20 of 50.
1962980	1965220	Oh shit, you were good at athletics.
1967580	1972180	As I'm running and leaping, the force that I put on my leg
1972220	1974540	finishes the break in my leg
1974540	1976580	and it just snaps underneath my weight.
1979060	1982020	And I fall within inches of the blob.
1984700	1986540	Just before it.
1987820	1989060	Before it, not after it.
1989060	1989900	So you didn't?
1989900	1990740	I didn't make it over.
1990740	1994100	No, as soon as I like tried to jump, my leg snapped
1994100	1997140	and I just fell down and my head is like two inches away
1997140	1998860	from the edge of the goo blob.
1998860	2000860	You fall down next to the blob
2000900	2003660	and really close to just a randomly placed Aldermen's
2003660	2005380	like blank face.
2007260	2010780	Just staring out in the distance, not at you,
2010780	2014020	but just lifelessly peering out of the goo at you
2014020	2016980	as you flop on the ground with your now broken,
2016980	2018060	fully broken chin.
2018060	2019340	Civic gooverment.
2023660	2025060	There's your episode title.
2028060	2029980	Yeah, there's the blank face next to him,
2029980	2032300	but if he looked up into the doorway
2032300	2036260	whereas his fellow Delta Green or Greenies
2037420	2041060	are, he would see Joe Dean's like face staring at him
2041060	2045060	very intently and he looks sad and then he looks determined
2045060	2049660	and you see Harlan on one side and Cindy on the other,
2049660	2052380	like closing the big doors.
2052380	2056660	As they do, he takes his spray can, flamethrower
2056660	2059300	and blast it onto the wood.
2059460	2061780	Tan is on the ground, face down on the ground,
2061780	2064380	just yelling, how could you do this to me,
2064380	2066660	you fucking monsters?
2068180	2069020	Fair.
2069020	2069860	Yeah, super fair.
2069860	2072820	I want the other three of you to roll sanity.
2075060	2075900	Yeah.
2078300	2080340	Pass, 26.
2080340	2082060	It's a pass with a seven.
2082060	2083580	They don't give a shit about me.
2083580	2084900	I actually fail.
2084900	2088660	Yeah, Cindy fails, 52 over 38.
2088660	2090300	It was that tattoo bond.
2090300	2091380	It was the tattoos.
2091380	2092780	That's gonna be two sanity
2092780	2094300	and then the other two of you are fine.
2094300	2095660	That's a breaking point, sir.
2095660	2096740	Oh, is it now?
2096740	2097580	Ruh-roh.
2097580	2101060	Unless you wanna project, but if you're anything like Luke,
2101060	2102860	you like your bonds too much to do that.
2102860	2106020	I would never ever do that to my grandson, Wally,
2106020	2108580	nor my gambling friend, Sharla.
2110180	2111020	That's fair.
2111020	2112300	In what disorder do you have already?
2112300	2116900	A need for making others uncomfortable.
2116900	2117740	Okay.
2117740	2119500	You're gonna cheat people at a distance.
2119500	2121420	You're gonna pick up some amnesia.
2124180	2126980	Not being able to necessarily piece things back together.
2126980	2129620	David wants you to stop having those flashback episodes.
2129620	2133020	No, I think he's saying more, more.
2136820	2138820	I'm glad you can read between the lines.
2140940	2144460	And in that moment, Cindy's eyes roll in the back of her head.
2144460	2148820	This sanity check has really taken her to a dark place.
2148820	2151180	She watches these memories disappear.
2152180	2153020	Number one.
2153020	2154700	Riding a bike.
2154700	2157900	Her husband was trying to hurt her grandson, Wally.
2157900	2159740	No, no.
2160740	2162220	With some natural force.
2162220	2163260	Oh, he got one in there.
2163260	2164100	Slit it in.
2164100	2165100	He got one in anyway.
2165100	2168340	Let's roll damage on that fire
2168340	2173140	as Tan is no longer visible, as the doors ignite,
2173140	2176860	the sweater ignites and whatever solvents you threw in.
2176860	2180420	First, a check to see if we get a crit success
2180420	2182940	or a crit failure firearms again
2182940	2184980	to see the effectiveness of this.
2186380	2187820	60 on a 70.
2187820	2189460	So success, that's good.
2189460	2191020	And then I'm gonna need damage.
2191020	2193060	There's a lot more accelerant now.
2193060	2196860	So in fact, I'm gonna want you to roll 2D8 on this.
2196860	2197700	Ooh.
2197700	2198540	Ooh.
2202620	2204780	One and four, five.
2206740	2209940	It cooks a bit more, but now it's out of your vision.
2209940	2213980	You're not quite sure exactly what happened to it
2213980	2218140	now that the doors are on fire and oh,
2218140	2220140	the whole town hall is starting to catch a flame.
2220140	2220980	Good.
2220980	2221820	Good, yeah.
2221820	2222660	Good.
2222660	2224420	Yeah, that was a plus in my mind from the get go.
2224420	2227060	If that wasn't happening, that was my plan.
2227060	2227900	Yeah, right.
2229140	2229980	What do you do?
2229980	2232540	Tan stands up and he's like one leg
2232540	2235460	hopping over to the window that's like barricaded
2235460	2238180	by the wood, the table, the whatever, you know,
2238180	2240520	just trying to rip that off the window.
2240520	2244380	Give me a strength check to see if you can get it loose.
2244380	2245780	Strength times five, I mean.
2247740	2248940	92.
2248940	2251500	I stand up and as I'm like trying to jerk
2251500	2255100	the like barricade stuff off, I...
2255100	2260100	That was surprisingly unintentional.
2263180	2265540	That was good, yeah.
2265540	2268300	As I'm trying to rip that off, I...
2268300	2270140	You shout, winners is coming.
2272060	2275540	Tan puts, in order to get some leverage,
2275540	2278740	he puts some weight on his broken leg
2278740	2281340	and just collapses again.
2281340	2284300	And as he collapses, part of his like shin bone
2284340	2285900	is like poking out of his leg.
2287380	2290640	We just hear his anguished scream.
2290640	2291480	Ah!
2293740	2295500	As we're booking it down the stairs.
2295500	2298220	Joe Dean is just like spraying everything he can
2298220	2300380	with this flamethrower like lighter set up.
2300380	2303220	Cindy takes one last look back down the hallway
2303220	2305540	before we make our way to the stairwell.
2305540	2306700	Harlan's grabbing the computer.
2306700	2308900	So the three of you are just, you grab the computer,
2308900	2311740	you're booking it down, you see the doors are burning,
2311740	2313260	you can see smoke kind of coming through
2313260	2316940	the crack of the door, see the fire starting to radiate out
2316940	2318340	and catch more of the hallway.
2318340	2321060	A lot of this town hall, even though it's stone
2321060	2323260	on the outside, there's still a lot of wood inside.
2323260	2325400	It's that old retro wooden paneling,
2325400	2327780	similar to what you saw in the original room
2327780	2330220	at the FBI briefing.
2330220	2331380	And it's igniting.
2331380	2334100	So the three of you are gonna be able to get outside
2334100	2338940	this round and Tan, still alive.
2338940	2340820	There's a lot of smoke though.
2340820	2345260	So for him to try one last time to rip open that window,
2345260	2348300	I'm gonna need a con times five check first
2348300	2352300	to see if he can overcome the smoke filling up his lungs
2352300	2354780	to use just one last burst of strength.
2362500	2363980	That's a nine on a 60.
2365100	2366780	You're able to hold your breath.
2366780	2369780	You don't let the smoke kind of overtake your lungs.
2369780	2371980	You still have enough oxygen in your bloodstream
2371980	2375720	to pull one more time at the board on the window.
2375720	2378720	Yeah, he picks himself back up.
2378720	2381140	He checks the chamber of his gun
2381140	2383600	and he's got three shots left.
2383600	2386080	And at the edge of like the wood,
2386080	2389300	this barricading the door, he just like fires into it
2389300	2391300	to try to like break it up a little bit
2391300	2394260	and then attempts to reach into the hole he's made
2394260	2395500	and pull it off.
2396660	2397540	Give me that strength.
2397540	2398860	35 pass.
2398860	2401780	You shoot it, point blank, splinter it a bit,
2401780	2404740	get it a little bit more loose, pops to the side.
2404740	2406880	There's smoke now pouring out
2406880	2409940	of that second story window of town hall
2409940	2412540	and your body is kind of just hanging out
2412540	2415820	at that first bit of fresh air, you gasp,
2418980	2419820	clear your lungs out,
2419820	2423020	but now you feel behind you the heat radiating
2423020	2425860	and that hot, hot smoke coming out behind you.
2425860	2428380	You can feel it almost discoloring your clothes.
2428820	2430740	It's such an intense burning right now.
2430740	2431660	What do you do?
2431660	2434940	Speaking of con checks, I want to check for Jennifer Khan.
2434940	2436740	How would you check for her?
2436740	2437580	Would you?
2437580	2438700	As we're like running down,
2438700	2440420	like assume we're passing her desk.
2440420	2442260	Oh yeah, I shout, Khan!
2446020	2448140	How would you check for her?
2448140	2450060	I didn't get it at first.
2450060	2450900	Good note, Joe.
2454480	2456820	There's no Khan, no response from Khan.
2456820	2457660	Khan!
2459220	2461860	Quick, if we get outside,
2461860	2463620	if he's trying to get out that window,
2463620	2466060	which we know he's trying to survive this,
2466060	2469140	then maybe we can grab that fitted sheet on three sides
2469140	2470740	and pull it tight enough to catch him.
2470740	2473380	Yeah, or maybe we put one in his corpse
2473380	2475540	when he hits, you know, when he hits the ground,
2475540	2476480	put one in his head.
2476480	2478220	You're not going to have time to get the sheet.
2478220	2479980	The fitted sheet from the hotel.
2480980	2481820	We scream.
2483540	2484780	Right clicker!
2484780	2485620	There!
2487060	2488480	When I'm looking out the window,
2488480	2491300	is there like a ledge that I can like get onto
2491300	2493520	and try to like at least lower myself
2493520	2495420	like five more feet before I just.
2495420	2498060	Yep, there's a stone ledge and below you,
2498060	2499580	it's somewhat garden.
2499580	2501260	There's some really low bushes
2501260	2503420	and then also just some ground.
2503420	2505460	Okay, so I, yeah, so.
2506620	2507460	Roll him luck.
2507460	2508300	Roll luck.
2508300	2509120	Roll me luck.
2509120	2509960	Let me set this up first.
2509960	2510780	Roll luck.
2510780	2511620	You set it up.
2511620	2512460	Okay, set it up, set it up.
2512460	2513740	The man gets out on the ledge.
2513740	2516900	He like crawls down and like hangs off the ledge.
2516900	2520020	So he's, you know, like a little bit closer to the ground.
2520020	2520980	And it's like a really short,
2520980	2522940	and basically his feet are just like
2522940	2525340	pretty much dangling right above the ground.
2525340	2526520	He looks down and he sees,
2526520	2529500	there's either like pavement or bushes
2529500	2533020	and he's going to like try to swing himself into the bushes
2533020	2535500	and try to land like horizontally onto them.
2535500	2540500	And it, and he loses his grip.
2544100	2548580	He loses his grip while he's swinging and starts falling.
2548580	2551860	Just so you know that a fail, a fail on my luck check.
2551860	2553940	Because you lowered yourself down,
2553940	2557060	you went from a distance where we'd be rolling
2557060	2561100	a lethality roll to actually control the amount of damage.
2561100	2561940	Hell yes.
2561940	2564140	So you're going to take two D six damage.
2566420	2571420	Six damage as you belly flop down into some mulch,
2572340	2575860	no hedges, maybe some low flowers.
2577420	2579500	Now I need a contest as well.
2579500	2582340	Con times five check that comes after the fall.
2583340	2586100	That is a success 13 on a 60.
2586100	2589020	So you flop, stomach down,
2589020	2591020	but not hard enough for you to lose your breath
2591020	2592220	and become stunned.
2592220	2594740	Anyone who survives the fall has to see if they're stunned.
2595220	2597940	Okay. I did, but I did, I did just take,
2597940	2599740	I'm down to four hit points.
2599740	2602020	So I took more than half, took more than half.
2602020	2603340	But was that what that role was?
2603340	2604740	No, that was for the fall.
2604740	2606420	So you're stunned anyway.
2606420	2607300	Yeah. Fair.
2607300	2609220	Yeah. When I fall it, yeah.
2609220	2610820	I land horizontally.
2610820	2613440	I like brace my head with my arm as I fall.
2613440	2615220	So I don't like whack my head.
2615220	2618300	Breath is knocked out of me and I'm like, I can't move.
2618300	2619580	I can't function right now.
2619580	2620500	At least you got out.
2620500	2623520	Joe Dean looks over at Harlan
2623520	2626520	and he, he looks at the gun he carries and he says,
2627760	2629480	do you have what it takes to do it?
2629480	2632280	Or will you give me that gun?
2632280	2635280	I, I think I should, I should,
2635280	2637520	I think I should work on the computer here.
2637520	2641760	He takes his, he takes his pistol and walks over to tan.
2641760	2643280	Who's screaming.
2643280	2644120	Yeah.
2644120	2644960	Fuck!
2646280	2647120	Yes!
2648880	2651040	Oh, thank God.
2651040	2652280	Help me.
2652280	2653120	You need to.
2653120	2653940	You piece of shit.
2653940	2655280	Fuck you, by the way.
2655280	2656120	Fair.
2656120	2657680	But you got to keep your voice down kid.
2657680	2659920	Can't be heard screaming like this.
2662000	2663740	Just, ah.
2663740	2665000	I reach my hands out.
2671200	2672040	Birds?
2674440	2675880	A flock of birds?
2675880	2677680	A bunch of pigeons from the roof.
2678520	2679360	No.
2679360	2680480	Holy shit, dude.
2680480	2682120	I don't think he can do it.
2682920	2684360	He turns and looks at Cindy.
2687440	2689340	All right, then you have to carry him.
2690480	2691320	All right.
2693040	2697320	And I, yeah, I pick his broken body up from the ground
2697320	2700940	and, and like fireman carry him away from there.
2700940	2703080	Yeah, let's get to the Bronco stat.
2703080	2704780	You get him into the Bronco.
2704780	2705960	The building is burning.
2705960	2709120	It is a raging inferno now.
2709120	2712360	You don't see Khan, no matter how loud you scream.
2713200	2715840	But remember the town hall is right in the center
2715840	2719240	of Grover'sville and around it,
2719240	2721220	there was the Sheriff's office next door,
2721220	2723200	the town library, the post office.
2723200	2727920	Just as you're getting into the Bronco and the inferno,
2727920	2731640	you're confident that pile of goo is thoroughly cooked
2731640	2732480	at this point.
2732480	2735780	It seemed as though fire is what really could damage it.
2736780	2740420	But almost as soon as fire fully engulfs the upper floor
2740420	2744260	of the building, you see people in town walking out
2744260	2746780	of their places of business.
2746780	2749780	You see the Sheriff, Dan Oakley, who you would talk to,
2749780	2752940	some of his deputies kind of just walking out in front
2752940	2754820	of the Sheriff's office.
2754820	2758980	You see the presumably librarian walk out of the library.
2758980	2761660	Some postal workers walk out of the post office.
2761660	2763540	Murrell's auto and body is right there.
2763540	2765220	Some of the mechanics walk out.
2765700	2767140	And you can see even in the distance,
2767140	2769660	some of the further businesses, everyone's walking out,
2769660	2772460	but they're not walking out looking at the fire
2772460	2773920	or looking at you.
2773920	2778920	They walk out and you see them grasping at their necks
2779300	2784300	and body as they just start uncontrollably vomiting
2785320	2788740	and coughing so loud and violently.
2788740	2791300	You can see almost their eyes go bloodshot.
2791300	2795420	They're coughing so hard as capillaries burst in their eyes
2795420	2799780	and slowly they all just keel over.
2799780	2801500	And everyone that walked out,
2801500	2804020	whether it's the Sheriff's librarian,
2804020	2805780	you're sitting in the Bronco watching this
2805780	2809580	within a couple of minutes, no movement.
2809580	2810420	What about us?
2810420	2811620	Yeah, how are we feeling?
2811620	2813060	We don't give a shit about them.
2813060	2813900	Yeah.
2815900	2817460	No, that's fucking crazy though.
2817460	2818700	That's so fucking awesome.
2818700	2820100	That's a really cool scene.
2821060	2824060	Joe, unfortunately, and by Joe, I mean, Harlan.
2824060	2825020	My partner, oh.
2827260	2828740	Oh, Joe.
2828740	2829580	Yeah.
2829580	2831340	He starts to not feel good as well.
2833180	2837020	There's something wrong.
2837020	2837860	What happened?
2837860	2839380	Did he fall out a fucking window?
2842020	2843260	I should have shot him.
2844340	2845380	He's angry.
2845380	2846380	He's very mad.
2847340	2852340	Joe, you start to feel inside your body in your lower back
2852460	2855740	around where your kidneys are, your intestines,
2855740	2857940	an intense amount of pain.
2857940	2862580	And as you feel that pain, it starts to move further up
2862580	2866340	almost as if your organs are reorganizing themselves
2866340	2868740	up into your stomach, into your chest
2868740	2870300	and it gets harder and harder to breathe
2870300	2875020	and you can feel yourself also slowly asphyxiating.
2875060	2876900	I imagine that he was in the back seat
2876900	2879700	and he is now pushing himself against the back of the seat
2879700	2881860	and he's now kind of going back over
2881860	2883940	and he's now in the back of the Bronco writhing
2883940	2885460	in that space back there.
2888700	2891060	Presumably all over the shattered body of.
2891060	2893220	Yeah, you stepped on me for sure.
2894300	2895660	Does anyone do anything?
2895660	2896500	No.
2896500	2898140	No, I lay there.
2898140	2899340	No one took medicine.
2899340	2900700	No one took medicine.
2900700	2902180	No one can do anything.
2902220	2905700	I mean, I try to show him his own pistol.
2905700	2908020	I ask if he wants this to end.
2908020	2909740	I think yes, but I'll double check with David.
2909740	2911500	Is this the kind of excruciating,
2911500	2913380	am I experiencing death at this point
2913380	2915460	or do I feel like I could do something?
2915460	2917260	Having watched what happened to everyone else,
2917260	2919740	it happened to everyone else much quicker,
2919740	2921620	but you can feel those coughs coming on.
2921620	2924740	You can feel your eyes, just the pressure against it
2924740	2927940	from gasping for breath plus the coughs.
2927940	2929940	You're not vomiting uncontrollably or anything
2929940	2932380	at this point, but it doesn't look good.
2932380	2935060	Through spasms in his body, wracking his body,
2935060	2938060	he is trying his hardest to nod yes with eyes bleeding.
2939540	2940460	Oh, woof.
2940460	2942540	Cindy looks in the rear view mirror.
2942540	2943500	Do it.
2943500	2945060	I open the back of the Bronco
2945060	2948340	and I just drag Harlan out like a sack of potatoes
2948340	2950780	by the scruff of his shirt.
2950780	2954780	I'm sorry, I liked your polos
2954780	2956460	and he puts one between the eyes.
2956460	2957540	I'm gonna roll dodge.
2960420	2961620	Oh, the alien got him.
2965100	2965940	Get in.
2967060	2968100	We have to call.
2968100	2969300	Where's the Crown Vic?
2969300	2970140	It's at the hotel.
2970140	2970980	All right, let's go.
2970980	2972060	No, it's here, it's here.
2972060	2973140	Let's ditch the Bronco.
2973140	2974340	We get in the DEA car.
2974340	2976900	We need to get on the phone and call Derringer, stat.
2976900	2979820	And I put Harlan in the trunk of the DEA car.
2979820	2981700	You really are fucking monsters.
2981700	2984220	Get in the back and shut the fuck up.
2984220	2985220	Jesus, too much.
2986220	2987740	No, not really.
2987740	2989140	Not really.
2989180	2990020	Appropriate.
2990020	2990860	It's fitting.
2990860	2993940	And she's gonna call our handler Derringer
2993940	2998700	at a number that is likely being listened to, she assumes.
2998700	3001180	Bring, bring, bring, bring.
3001180	3003380	Yeah, we knock and ring the doorbell, too.
3006140	3007580	Yeah?
3007580	3008420	Who is it?
3008420	3010220	It's Woodabaga.
3010220	3011340	We're leaving.
3011340	3013060	Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop.
3013060	3014060	Where are you calling from?
3014060	3015740	The car.
3015740	3017420	A car phone, nice.
3018300	3020740	They haven't really learned to track those
3020740	3022220	or listen to those as well.
3022220	3024420	I'll keep that in mind as I tell you everything.
3024420	3026980	Yeah, smart.
3026980	3027820	What do you got?
3027820	3030220	Grover'sville needs a cleanup crew ASAP.
3030220	3033060	The cover story is that there's a drug
3033060	3035180	called super meth in the area.
3035180	3036380	Got into the water supply.
3036380	3040460	Got into the water supply, took out damn near everyone.
3040460	3042260	I would say literally everyone.
3042260	3045460	Maybe we get some plants that say that they survived.
3045460	3046300	What do you have, Joe?
3046340	3049100	Well, when we say cleanup, first of all,
3049100	3051220	hi, hello, hi, it's Joe.
3052220	3053940	When we say cleanup,
3053940	3056140	you might have to burn this place to the ground.
3056140	3058900	Yeah, we're talking 1199 bodies.
3058900	3060180	And something needs to,
3060180	3063900	you probably need to send a more specialist team
3063900	3066380	to maybe investigate the water supply.
3066380	3068780	Yeah, and a computer scientist.
3068780	3071580	Oh yeah, we just shot our computer scientist.
3071580	3075020	We've got information, so we have a laptop.
3075180	3076020	Wait, what do you have?
3076020	3076940	Hold on, you have a laptop.
3076940	3078420	All right, get the laptop here now.
3078420	3079540	Memphis Field Office,
3079540	3081620	I'll have a room set up with someone ready to go.
3081620	3084620	The issue is I cannot get a team there
3084620	3087820	for at least six to eight hours.
3087820	3089140	It has to come from DC.
3089140	3090700	We can't get those resources here.
3090700	3094180	Well, Grover'sville is at the butt end of the locale,
3094180	3097260	so I don't think anyone will show up for six to eight hours.
3097260	3098180	Look, it's fine.
3098180	3099860	You guys just get out of there.
3100700	3102140	Hopefully the rest of you are fine,
3102140	3105020	but just give me that laptop now.
3105020	3108460	No one is going to be there for at least six hours.
3108460	3112020	So just get out in case someone else gets there first.
3112020	3114420	There's no one left in Grover'sville.
3115340	3118700	So I think the dead will be fine
3118700	3120300	for the next six or eight hours.
3121860	3125140	Joe like punches the fucking gas and-
3125140	3126860	Are you speeding down the highway
3126860	3130380	in a Crown Vic or a Ford Bronco?
3130820	3132300	Thankfully, the Crown Vic,
3132300	3135380	if you could let local authorities know to not pull us over,
3135380	3136580	we will be speeding.
3136580	3139900	And Tan is still sitting in the back of the Bronco
3139900	3142860	that is just sitting in front of City Hall.
3144100	3145540	Cause no one got me.
3146660	3148860	Is his dead body in the back of the Bronco too?
3148860	3151260	We took his dead body, but not your live one.
3154460	3155860	Cindy was yelling shut the fuck up
3155860	3158220	to no one in particular in the back seat.
3161260	3162220	Shut up.
3162220	3164900	Okay, we're only like a minute outside of town.
3164900	3167180	So we got to go get that fucking piece of shit.
3167180	3168220	We saved him once.
3169620	3170460	Turn around.
3170460	3171300	I spared his life.
3171300	3174260	So now I like owe him my air, whatever, how that works.
3174260	3175080	You know-
3175080	3175920	Jar Jar Binks clause, I know.
3175920	3176740	Yeah, exactly.
3176740	3178220	It's a Jar Jar situation.
3178220	3180220	Who was a guy we know.
3180220	3183460	Also, I've given you no reason to dislike me.
3183460	3184860	Yeah.
3184860	3186180	We don't dislike you.
3186180	3188140	It's just the mission.
3188140	3189260	They called for it.
3189820	3192740	You're lying in extreme pain in the back of this Bronco,
3192740	3196180	just like looking at the felt on the roof of it.
3196180	3197580	Well, I was trying to get out,
3197580	3200740	but the child blocks are on, so I'm like stuck in there.
3202140	3206320	Yeah, you hear the Crown Vic like crunch back up
3206320	3207160	and roll to a stop.
3207160	3208260	As soon as I hear that,
3208260	3210340	like all my energy has been expended
3210340	3211420	trying to get out of here,
3211420	3215320	but I hear you guys coming back and I just pass out.
3215320	3216740	Cindy grabs him by the shoulders,
3216740	3219060	throws him into the back of the Crown Vic
3219820	3223300	and we bust it to the Memphis field office.
3223300	3225380	So that's Cindy in the front seat then
3225380	3227660	and Jodine sitting shotgun.
3227660	3228480	Yeah.
3228480	3230580	And then a passed out tan in the back
3230580	3233580	and then a dead Harlan in the trunk.
3233580	3234500	That is correct.
3234500	3236540	That's how all the green ops end.
3238220	3240980	As you get two miles outside of town
3240980	3243780	and you're heading Southwest towards Memphis,
3243780	3246980	lying low in the opposite direction towards town
3246980	3250540	are three Blackhawk helicopters.
3250540	3251840	Fuck yeah.
3251840	3253160	Broken Arrow boys.
3255180	3257100	Heading the other way towards town
3257100	3259940	as you drive towards Memphis and scene.
3259940	3263000	That's scene as far as you know it.
3263000	3265500	Ooh, hit us with the next scene.
3265500	3267660	Well, no, I mean, there's not really much of the next scene.
3267660	3268760	It's kind of how much.
3269700	3272380	What's the scene we don't know, David?
3272380	3273500	Tell us secrets.
3273500	3275780	Well, was that weird at all at the end?
3275780	3277800	Dude, that was fucking rad.
3277800	3279540	What doesn't add up at this point?
3279540	3280720	And what do you want to know?
3280720	3282420	Who called in that Blackhawk?
3282420	3284620	What organization had the helicopters flying around?
3284620	3285740	Yeah, what was that?
3285740	3288340	So you get that computer back to HQ
3288340	3291260	and as long as it stays in Delta Green's hands
3291260	3293100	and they correctly look at it,
3293100	3297940	it was a communication device between the aldermen in town
3297940	3302940	and some other civilians, Majestic 12 and the Grays.
3303240	3304080	Wow.
3304080	3305520	Wow.
3305520	3307720	It was the aliens the whole time
3307720	3310680	abducting these citizens to form the experiments.
3313000	3315440	And the government was just letting them do it.
3315440	3318140	Yeah, there was an entire portion of this
3318140	3320200	where you could have actually confronted the aliens
3320200	3321960	and fought the aliens themselves.
3322960	3326100	I tried to ask the aldermen to behave themselves.
3327720	3328880	They were not interested in discourse.
3328880	3330320	Where would that have taken place?
3330320	3333060	A small farm about three miles outside of town.
3333060	3334740	Where you shot Jane Allen.
3336700	3340060	That was converted into basically an experimentation area
3340060	3341100	where all these people were,
3341100	3342780	where they stored all the gray goo
3342780	3345500	and they were just injecting this gray goo into people,
3345500	3347420	more or less replacing people's organs.
3347420	3349180	So that's what happened to Billy Ray.
3349180	3352300	They replaced all of his musculature with this goo.
3352300	3356340	Joe had his digestive organs replaced last night
3356340	3357580	while he was sleeping.
3357580	3358780	Jesus.
3358780	3360380	That was fun.
3360380	3362780	Because it was just him in a room.
3363740	3365640	You guys didn't double up or anything else.
3365640	3367620	They were able to just slip in, grab him,
3367620	3369740	return him afterwards.
3369740	3372700	So that's why he died that horrible death at the end.
3372700	3375980	Everyone else in town had some level of experimentation
3375980	3377900	or they just lived in town long enough
3377900	3380920	that they had ingested enough of this material
3380920	3383500	that it was just all in their bloodstream and everywhere.
3383500	3385640	Even if they didn't replace a particular organ,
3385640	3386940	it was all inside of them.
3386940	3388020	To make matters worse,
3388020	3390220	once you have that much of it inside of you,
3390940	3391900	so none of you except maybe Joe,
3391900	3393680	but maybe still not even Joe,
3393680	3395780	the aliens can see through your eyes,
3395780	3397400	the aliens can control you,
3397400	3399500	and they use it mostly for security.
3399500	3400980	And they know who your crush is.
3400980	3401980	Don't tell.
3404340	3405340	They use it for security.
3405340	3407060	So they're often controlling the sheriff,
3407060	3410660	but they'll use other kind of senior people and stuff.
3410660	3412380	That's why everyone was being so weird
3412380	3414980	about people not being missing.
3414980	3416860	Yeah, I was gonna ask,
3416860	3418460	the people that we talked to,
3418460	3420140	were they just like lying to us
3421020	3421860	and they knew about the alien stuff
3421860	3423020	or did they not have any clue?
3423020	3424820	There's just too much of it in them already?
3424820	3426740	It makes them like docile basically.
3426740	3428460	There's a sidebar in it
3428460	3430220	and it's called work, work, work, work.
3430220	3433420	And basically everyone can just in their brain
3433420	3435540	reason as to why people aren't around
3435540	3436460	and it's totally fine.
3436460	3437300	Like the mom is just like,
3437300	3439020	yeah, my daughter, like she's cool.
3439020	3440260	What, like why should I be worried?
3440260	3441100	Yeah, that was really sad.
3441100	3442140	Or my husband's like, I'm a cool mom.
3442140	3443100	She's a cool kid.
3444640	3447380	But yeah, that's one of the questions, I guess.
3447380	3450520	What is the most popular menu item at Mega Deuce?
3451780	3453980	Well, they have a couple of different things actually.
3453980	3455980	And it's kind of a tier based system.
3455980	3457920	There's the Single Deuce,
3457920	3462920	which is a single cheeseburger and a small shake.
3463260	3464660	The Double Deuce,
3464660	3467660	which is a double cheeseburger with a medium shake.
3467660	3469680	And then the Mega Deuce,
3470820	3473940	which is eight patties.
3473940	3475460	Yeah, it's like eight patties,
3475460	3476980	extra large milkshake.
3477480	3479060	And the slogan is, it's so good,
3479060	3481220	it'll make you take a Mega Deuce.
3481220	3482060	Wow.
3482060	3483380	That is, it's a good slogan.
3483380	3485420	David, you got me hungry.
3485420	3486260	It's catchy.
3486260	3488620	It's so much food, you'll shit a lot.
3491500	3494980	And Merle, how is he the one who is in charge of it all?
3496420	3498020	He really wasn't.
3498020	3499020	He was not.
3499020	3502380	He was just an alderman, but all the alderman.
3502380	3505740	He was just an alderman, but all the alderman.
3505740	3506700	Yeah, Alan Alda.
3507260	3509620	He was played by Alan Alda, actually.
3509620	3511380	We noticed that, yeah, but we did notice
3511380	3514260	that it was all the alderman, we're all the men.
3514260	3516780	And so we smashed the patriarchy tonight, boys.
3516780	3519260	That's what we did, congratulations.
3519260	3520660	And killed everyone else down there.
3520660	3522580	Don't break the glass ceiling
3522580	3525540	or David's dump is gonna pile all over us.
3525540	3530540	Was, I assume, was Jane Allen pregnant with an alien baby?
3531340	3533420	Nope, that was just a normal pregnant teenager
3533420	3534240	that you murder.
3534240	3536100	She would have died either way.
3536620	3538020	They abducted Jane Allen.
3538020	3540540	You didn't really go around spraying the purple stuff
3540540	3542320	on her or on Joe, for that matter.
3542320	3543460	You probably would have realized
3543460	3546060	Joe was actually completely screwed
3546060	3550620	had you sprayed it like a little more fully all over him.
3550620	3553520	Yeah, stripped down and started like spraying your bodies.
3553520	3555300	You would have seen the same incision marks
3555300	3557220	kind of on Billy Ray's arms.
3557220	3560220	Oh shit, the one person whose arms we didn't look at.
3562260	3565200	She was just recently pregnant with Billy Ray
3565240	3568160	about a week before he went on his crime spree.
3568160	3570240	She didn't even know, she was abducted.
3570240	3574160	They took out her uterus with the baby,
3574160	3577320	gave her this, it's called proto-matter, the goo,
3577320	3579600	then put something, you don't know.
3579600	3582280	So it's every single person in Grover'sville
3582280	3584880	like coughed and died slowly?
3584880	3585720	Yeah.
3585720	3588000	Can you choose like one child out of the town
3588000	3589820	and describe that in detail for us?
3591720	3593660	Well, I can tell you about,
3593660	3595380	so a lot of people had experiments, right?
3595380	3598820	So the little kids that you met at the reservoir
3598820	3602580	that were pounding seven and a half pieces a piece,
3602580	3604740	they had work done on their livers.
3604740	3606020	They had super livers.
3606020	3607420	Oh wow.
3607420	3609820	As these aliens know how to party.
3612380	3615020	David, thank you so much for running this game for us.
3615020	3617500	This was such a blast and thank you for sticking around
3617500	3619100	for this extended episode.
3619100	3621420	All five weeks, yeah, we really appreciate it, man.
3621420	3623020	We're gonna open the cage now.
3623740	3626140	I wanted to get it to some sort of a conclusion
3626140	3629300	because we could have just thoroughly harassed
3629300	3630860	citizens for presumably.
3630860	3631700	So many more.
3631700	3633180	If we didn't even touch the bowling alley,
3633180	3634020	we could have like.
3635380	3636880	Have you ever run this before?
3636880	3637720	No, not at all.
3637720	3640320	I prepped this exclusively for this,
3640320	3643500	largely because Zach gave me very few options
3643500	3646140	as far as things he has not looked at before.
3646140	3646960	That's my way.
3646960	3647800	I liked it.
3647800	3649480	I mean, this is a shorter scenario.
3649480	3651220	It's only like a dozen pages.
3651220	3653020	It's something you could hypothetically do
3653020	3657580	with efficient players who stay on track for things.
3659060	3661860	In under four hours at a con.
3661860	3664740	David, those are, that's just an urban legend.
3665740	3667340	Oh, those players don't exist.
3667340	3669740	I think they just play different games, maybe.
3671680	3673940	But no, thank you very much for having me.
3673940	3676260	This was a fun crossover event.
3676260	3677900	Like I said, I love you guys' stuff.
3677900	3680040	Yeah, the pleasure was all ours, completely.
3680040	3681480	Thank you for all of this.
3681480	3683160	Thanks for everyone, I guess, who listened
3683160	3685920	and put up with me for the last five episodes.
3685920	3687200	Blessed with your presence.
3687200	3688820	Those people who know me from elsewhere,
3688820	3690000	who followed along,
3690000	3691580	hopefully I haven't totally ruined
3691580	3693400	Delta Green for you either.
3693400	3695600	That would be on us, so you're in the clear.
3697160	3698600	But if you like that nonsense,
3698600	3701980	go to episode one of Pretending to be People
3701980	3705780	and go ahead and start down that long path.
3705780	3707600	You've got plenty to catch up on.
3707600	3709760	You can see where they cut their teeth
3709760	3712480	by harassing random civilians.
3712480	3715520	Yep, it's kind of our trademark.
3717520	3720160	Just authority figures abusing that power
3720160	3721920	for petty reasons and little gain.
3721920	3724720	It's an all lawful evil campaign.
3727800	3730280	Okay, well, David, we're gonna open the cage now.
3730280	3732360	Yeah, you are free to go.
3732360	3734000	Creak!
3734000	3735160	Oh, wow, he really took off.
3735160	3736000	He's scampering.
3736000	3736820	He's scampering.
3736820	3737660	Oh, wow.
3737660	3739500	When I make a scamper, that's what I think of.
3740100	3740940	There's a little dust trail.
3740940	3742780	His calves are good.
3742780	3744100	He did not want to be here.
3769500	3771020	I can't get high.
3771020	3773440	I can't get high.
3773440	3777700	I thought this stuff helped anxiety.
3777700	3781140	It must be something inside of me.
3781140	3783140	Does anybody know why?
3783140	3785100	I don't know why.
3785100	3787100	I can't get high.
3787100	3790580	I can't get high.
3790580	3797580	I can't see through, I can't, and I don't wanna try.
3798580	3803580	Please, my smile, won't you spare me something?
3803580	3807580	Where can you buy it?
3807580	3816580	Where do you begin when you don't know how?
3816580	3825580	Hallucinations held big time by spiders out the line.
3825580	3833580	Breathing in, breathing out.
3833580	3837580	I've been hiding in low, low places
3837580	3841580	with some funny looking dudes with some fucked up faces.
3841580	3846580	And I can't help the feeling I'll always be at the bottom.
3855580	3871580	I think I'm allergic or something.
3871580	3878580	Better go on with nothing so I won't get high.
3878580	3884580	No, I won't get high.
3884580	3888580	By all means, do it if it helps.
3888580	3892580	For me, it makes my brain melt easy.
3892580	3895580	Does anybody know why?
3895580	3901580	I can't get high.
3901580	3909580	I can't see through, I can't, and I don't wanna try.
3909580	3913580	Please, my smile, won't you spare me something?
3913580	3918580	Where can you buy it?
3918580	3927580	Where do you begin when you don't know how?
3927580	3936580	Hallucinations held big time by spiders out the line.
3936580	3944580	Breathing in, breathing out.
3944580	3948580	I've been hiding in low, low places
3948580	3953580	with some funny looking dudes with some fucked up faces.
3953580	3958580	And I can't help the feeling I'll always be at the bottom.
3966580	3968580	Thank you for watching.
