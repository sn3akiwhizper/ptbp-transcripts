# PTBP Ideas

The Recap document found in this document was created by the community towards the end of Season 1, I'm just storing it here to build up the Fandom wiki pages.

## misc

- page: episode guide (listing all episodes by season/arc/whatev)
  - create episode table template, template for table overall then each row is a seperate template, eases the copy/paste-ability to the couple of pages each episode needs details on (wish we could populate from a spreadsheet, but then it would be wordpress i suppose)
- edit PTBP template page to detail what templates to use when: <https://pretending-to-be-people.fandom.com/wiki/Pretending_to_be_People_Wiki:Templates>
- location pages
  - interactive maps
- timeline of events for related story arcs?
